History has seen similar periods that have been associated with global scale disasters, wars and other extraordinary circumstances.\nIf we try to look to the future without preconceptions and in an open way, we can foresee some of the general scenarios or individual moments that are more likely to occur.\n1. The definitive, rapid and irrevocable collapse of globalization. For some time it has shown signs of crisis, but the epidemic has annihilated all the main axioms: the open borders, the solidarity of the societies, the effectiveness of the existing economic institutions and the competence of the elites in power. Globalization has failed ideologically (liberalism), economically (global networks) and politically (leadership of the western elites).\nThe sooner we recognize this particular turning point, the more prepared we will be to face the new challenges. The situation is comparable to that of the last days of the USSR: the vast majority of the Soviet ruling class even refused to consider moving to a new model of state, governance and ideology, and only a very small minority she realized the true nature of the crisis and was ready to adopt an alternative model. In a bipolar world, the collapse of one pole has left only the other, and so the choice has been to recognize its victory, copy its institutions and try to be assimilated into its structures. This is what led to the globalization of the 1990s and the unipolar world.\nToday, what is coming down is the unipolar world, a fact that has been recognized (in terms of ideology, economy and political order) by all the major world players, China, Russia and almost everyone else, and that has been welcomed with new attempts to gain independence and improve their conditions. Consequently, the ruling elites are faced with a more complex problem: the choice between a model that crumbles into the abyss and the total unknown, in which nothing can serve as a model for building the future. One can imagine how, even more than at the end of the Soviet era, the ruling elites will cling to globalism and its structures despite the evident collapse of all its mechanisms, tools, institutions and structures.\nTherefore, the number of those who manage to navigate more or less freely in the growing chaos will be quite small even within the elite. How the relationship between globalists and post-globalists will develop is difficult to imagine, but it is already possible to anticipate in general terms the main points of the post-globalist reality.\n1. The open society will become a closed society. Sovereignty will rise to the rank of highest value, of absolute value. The good will be declared to be the salvation and vital support of a particular people within a concrete state. Power will be legitimate only if it can deal with this task: first of all, save people's lives in the context of a pandemic and the catastrophic processes that accompany it, and then organize a political, economic and ideological structure that allows them to defend interests of this company closed in relation to the others. This does not necessarily imply a war of all with all, but at the same time it determines first of all the main and absolute priority of this country and this people. No other ideological consideration can prevail on this principle.\n2. A closed society must be autocratic. This means that it must be self-sufficient and independent of external suppliers in the first place regarding food, industrial production, in its monetary and financial system and in relation to its military power. All of this will become the top priority in the fight against the epidemic when states are forced to close - but in the post-globalist world this will be a permanent feature. If globalists view it as a temporary measure, post-globalists should, on the contrary, prepare to make it a strategic priority.\n3. Self-sufficiency in supporting life, resources, the economy and politics must be combined with an effective foreign policy, where strategic alliances play a leading role. The most important thing is to have a sufficient number of strategically and geopolitically important allies who together constitute a potential block able to provide all participants with effective resistance and a sufficiently reliable defense against probable external aggressions. The same goes for economic and financial ties that expand the volume of accessible markets, not on a global but regional scale.\n4. To ensure sovereignty and autonomy, it is important to establish control over those areas on which the sovereignty and security of each sovereign entity depends. This makes some integration processes a geopolitical imperative. The existence of hostile (potential or real) enclaves in threatening proximity to the national territory will undermine defense and security. Therefore, already in the phase of struggle against the epidemic, it is necessary to foresee and define a certain model of integration.\nThe post-globalist world can be imagined in the form of several large centers and a number of secondary centers. Each major pole must meet the requirements of autarky. It is a model similar to that of traditional empires. This implies:\n- a single vertical rigid control system (in a crisis situation with dictatorial powers to the supreme authority);\n- full responsibility of the state and its institutions for the life and health of citizens;\n- the assumption by the state of responsibility for the supply of food to its population within closed borders, which presupposes developed agriculture;\n- the establishment of full monetary sovereignty, with the national currency anchored to gold or to the coverage of goods (that is, to the real economy) rather than to the system of world reserves;\n- the guarantee of a high rate of development of the national industry sufficient to compete effectively with other closed States (which does not exclude cooperation, but only when the principle of independence and industrial autonomy is not affected);\n- creation of an efficient military industry and the necessary scientific and production infrastructures;\n- control and maintenance of the transport and communication system which guarantees the connection between the individual territories of the State.\nObviously, to achieve these extraordinary objectives, it is necessary:\n- a very special elite (post-globalist political class);\n- as a consequence, it will be necessary to adopt a completely new state ideology (liberalism and globalism are not particularly suitable for this purpose, to put it mildly).\nThe political class should be recruited from the leaders and staff of military institutions.\nIdeology should reflect the historical-cultural and religious characteristics of a particular society and have a futurological orientation - the projection of civilizational identity into the future.\nIt is important to note that almost all countries and blocks of modern countries - both those completely immersed in globalization and those who have tried to stay away from it - will have to go through something similar.\nIn this regard, it must be assumed that these processes will make the United States one of the most important world players and at the same time change its nature - from a citadel of globalization to a powerful autocratic entity that merely defends its limited interests. The prerequisites for such a transformation are already contained in part in the Donald Trump program, and in the fight against pandemics and in a state of emergency this will acquire even more distinct characteristics.\nFrance and Germany are also ready to follow the same path - so far, with emergency measures, other European powers are already mobilizing in this direction. As the crisis gets worse and longer, these processes will get closer and closer to what we have outlined.\nChina is relatively ready for such a turnaround, ideologically and politically, as a rigidly centralized state with a pronounced vertical power. China is losing a lot with the collapse of globalization, which has managed to put its national interests at the service, but in general it has always placed a particular emphasis on its own autarchy, which it has not neglected even in the periods of maximum opening.\nThere are prerequisites for such a post-globalist evolution in Iran, Pakistan and in part in Turkey, which could become the poles of the Islamic world.\nIndia, which is rapidly revitalizing its national identity, has begun to actively re-establish ties with the friendly countries of the region in the context of the pandemic, preparing new processes.\nRussia also has a number of positive aspects in these starting conditions:\n- Putin's policy over the past two decades aimed at strengthening his sovereignty;\n- the availability of serious military power;\n- historical precedents of full or relative autarky;\n- traditions of ideological and political independence;\n- strong national and religious identity;\n- the recognition by the majority of the legitimacy of the centralist and paternalist model of government.\nHowever, the current ruling elite, formed in the late Soviet and post-Soviet eras, are not taking up the challenges of the time at all, being the heir to the bipolar and unipolar (globalist) world order and related thinking. Economically, financially, ideologically and technologically, Russia is too tied to the globalist structure, which makes it in many ways unprepared to deal effectively with the epidemic if it turns from a short-term emergency into the creation of a new - and irreversibly post- globalist - world order. These elites share a liberal ideology and base their activities to some extent on transnational structures - sale of resources, relocation of industry, dependence on imported goods and products, integration into the global financial system with the recognition of the dollar as a reserve currency , etc. Neither in their competences, nor in their world view, nor in their political and administrative culture, are these elites able to guide the transition to the new state. However, this state of affairs is common to the vast majority of countries, where globalization and liberalism have until recently been considered indestructible and irrefutable dogmas. In this case, Russia has the opportunity to change this state of affairs, making the state and society ready to enter the new post-globalist order.\nTranslation by Donato Mancuso"}, {"url": "https://m.alwafd.news/%D9%85%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%80%D9%8A/2905278-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%86%D9%82%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A7-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%88%D9%88%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9", "title": "Report: US military may transfer SK to Chinese Wuhan", "text": "Bahauddin Abu Apartment\nDr. Hany Sarieddine\nWajdi Zainuddin\nA report published on the Canadian website concluded that the United States may stand unintentionally behind the emergence of the new Corona virus \"Covid-19\" in the Chinese city of Wuhan, according to Russia Today.\nAnd a former Professor at the University of Shanghai, Larry Romanov, stated in a report published by the Canadian Globalresearch, that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered last summer to close a large military biological laboratory at Fort Detrick base in Maryland, in anticipation of possible leaks.\nAfter the move, the United States last August witnessed a wave of pneumonia and similar diseases, and this was attributed to the repercussions of electronic cigarettes, but this hypothesis raised the suspicions of some experts.\nAfter that, media and activists in China reported that five of the Americans who participated in the international military games competitions hosted by Wuhan last October were infected with unspecified infection.\nChinese sources suggested that this mysterious disease was in fact \"Covid-19\", which he transferred to Wuhan, an American military, and he may have been infected by an accident that was not announced in Fort Detrick, and he was not diagnosed because of the absence of any concrete symptoms."}, {"url": "https://ertikaznews.com/?p=41854", "title": "Oats and corn flakes strengthen immunity against \"corona\" - Arktaz News", "text": "Elena Malysheva, the famous Russian presenter and presenter, enumerated some nutrients that can boost the body's immunity to fight the infection of the Coruna virus.\nDuring one of her televised medical programs, Malysheva said: \"Food products that contain large amounts of zinc are necessary to activate the so-called killer cells in the body.

Western Europe will begin to look a lot like Libya after the NATO intervention, war-torn Yemen or Syria. Governments facing increased breakdown of law and order will tend to resort to violent repression and some may succeed in clinging to power that way. Others will be overthrown, setting off an endless chain of power grabs and armed political struggle. Civil war may come to many places.\nMost people living the “West” have been telling themselves they were citizens of a democratic state. Not surprising, since they were taught this in school and have been hearing the same ever since from their media. Few realize that the much-vaunted democracies they reside in, are at best just badly disguised plutocracies, certainly since the Fall of the Berlin Wall, when neoliberal capitalism was adopted as the universal state ideology in the “West.” This has led to the establishment of what may be properly calledkakistocracy,the Greek word for rule by the worst elements in society. Since the availability of easy money has siphoned off many otherwise capable and talented people to the world of business and banking, politics has been abandoned to men (and women) without qualities. Effortlessly adopting whatever form, stance or position only to get ahead in the world and line their pockets along the way, most of these new generation politicians have no morals, no intelligence, no principles, no ideas, nothing. The choices made by “Western” governments in response to the “corona pandemic” are a case in point. From the point of view of medicine and public health, the dreaded coronavirus is not a serious problem. Sure enough, the World Health Organization, headed by a politician with a dodgy past and funded largely by Bill Gates, has officially declared a pandemic. In response, one “Western” government after another has declared a national emergency and put the country in lockdown. As a result, millions and millions are now losing their jobs and entire national economies are made to suffer irreparable damage, yet aggregate average monthly death rates are not even higher than in 2019, 2018 and 2017. From the very beginning, aided by a supine press, governments have been fiddling with the numbers, going to extremes to give the impression that the coronavirus death toll is appalling. The question arises as to why a responsible government would want to wreck the national economy, cause incredible personal suffering by forbidding people to leave their homes, and to wreak irreparable social havoc al for the sake of a handful of fat, unhealthy elderly citizens with respiratory problems caused by the virus? Most of these patients had a very low life expectancy to begin with, then why overburden and imperil the entire heath care system? Are those the policies that a responsible government would adopt? If so, that would give the word “responsible” a whole new meaning. Only a government without a grasp of reality, with a total lack of ethical and political principles, accustomed to trampling on the rights of citizens for decades, would decree a total lockdown just to save a few people, or a government that would be taking orders from some unknown higher authority. But let us not go in that direction for the moment. Let us assume the lockdowns were ordered by incompetent and irresponsible leaders. The next question then should be if those governments were aware of the possible consequences of their decrees. What might these consequences be? In the first place, widespread bankruptcies. As a result of government-ordered closing, countless retailers, bars, and restaurants will disappear, forever changing inner cities. Many small industries will also have to close down. Big players like Amazon, Starbucks and assorted fast food giants will gladly fill any gaps, which means that those laid off as a result of bankruptcies will be forced to either take low-paid wage-slave work or be without a job for many years to come. GNP will shrink everywhere, and average incomes will drop sharply. Faced with high budget deficits, governments will have to resort to widespread tax increases, causing even more social misery. Crime rates will soar, inner cities and many residential areas will morph into no-go areas. Many cities will begin to look like Dearborn, Michigan. Secondly, most people will have lost their trust in government, while many will be very angry and try to oppose, subvert and sabotage government policies. Very likely, most “Western” governments will face a legitimacy crisis never seen before. Government authority is likely to crumble everywhere, except in those few areas where the rich assemble, living in permanent fear of the rabble's wrath. Many places will be taken over by a kind of permanent, low-intensity civil war, as predicted by Israeli military historian Martin van Creveld. Western Europe will begin to look a lot like Libya after the NATO intervention, war-torn Yemen or Syria. Governments facing increased breakdown of law and order will tend to resort to violent repression and some may succeed in clinging to power that way. Others will be overthrown, setting off an endless chain of power grabs and armed political struggle. Civil war may come to many places. Would all those fools still in power have realized such might be the result of their hypocritical decision to “protect the citizens against COVID-19?” If they haven't, it might actually be kind of reassuring.\nIf they have and the current socio-economic destruction is intentional, it would mean their objective is precisely that: to destroy the economy, to drive the citizens to despair and to roll out a totalitarian state."}, {"url": "http://asdaapress.com/?ID=52955", "title": "This important nutrient contains the secret of immunity against corona", "text": "Elena Malysheva, the famous Russian presenter and presenter, has shed some nutrients that can boost the body's immunity to fight infection with the Corona virus.\nWorld - Europe\nDuring one of her televised medical programs, Malysheva said: \"Food products that contain large amounts of zinc are necessary to activate the so-called killer cells in the body.

The scientist is a leading specialist in the 11 strongest development funds in America and did not have the right to cooperate with foreign laboratories without special permission and especially not to receive grants and other funds from foreign interested parties. Now he faces a prison term on charges of espionage in favor of foreign structures.\nIn total, Charles Liber from 2012 to 2017 received about $ 2 million from a Chinese university and another $ 1.5 million grant to open a laboratory at a Chinese university. As you know, with the help of grants, the Chinese are trying to get foreign technology and attract more experienced specialists. The case also indicates that in 2018-2019, Liber participated in the latest discoveries and developments of the Chinese University in Virology, which Chinese scientists themselves were not stingy to write in their reports on the official website of the university. At the same time, information about the scientist’s participation in developments related to coronavirus infections in the Pentagon’s military laboratory was removed in 2015. Now, as they say, the sheep will be fed up (sort of like the potential culprit of the Pandemic will be punished) and the wolves are safe (that is, customers).

On 30 January, he declared the virus an international emergency, but made clear that there was no reason for countries to issue travel-advisories against travelling to China. Let me speculate. The ‘international emergency’ was declared at the request of Washington, and the comment against the travel-advisory was an addition by Dr. Tedros himself, as he realized that there was indeed no reason for panic, that China is doing wonders in stemming the virus from spreading and in detecting the virus early on.\nIn fact, Dr. Tedros has himself, as well as other high-ranking WHO officials, on various occasions praised China for her effort to contain the virus, the speed with which Wuhan (population of 11 million, capital of the center-eastern Province of Hubei) and China as a whole has reacted to the outbreak. The latest achievement – in 8 days China has built in Wuhan a 25,000 m2 special hospital for treatment of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV and possible mutations, with 1,000 beds, and for about 1,400 medical personnel, for a budget of the equivalent of US$ 43 million – equipped with state-of-the-art medical technology. No other country in the world would have been capable of such an achievement.\nNevertheless, and against WHO’s guidance, Washington immediately advised its citizens not to travel to China, and withdrew non-essential staff from US consulates and the Embassy in Beijing, thereby triggering an avalanche of similar reactions among Washington vassals around the globe; i.e., most of the European countries did likewise, many of them canceled their flights to China, as did, of course, the US.\nRussia also closed her 4,200 km long border, working hand-in-hand with China in containing the virus. This also means that no infected Russian citizen may leave China. This is a concerted Chinese-Russian effort – spearheaded by China – to control and contain the epidemic.\nThe NYT and WashPo are on a vicious daily campaign to slander and vilify China with lies and manipulated information on how badly China is managing the disease, when the complete opposite is the case. Compare this to the common flu epidemic that hits the US and most of the western countries, despite the fact that the US and Europe have virtually implemented carpet vaccination (in some US States and EU countries even compulsory).\nYet, this 2019 / 2020 flu season which is far from over, has so far claimed more than 8,400 lives alone in the US, more than 140,000 hospitalizations and more than 8 million infected people. The US has about 330 million people. Compare this to China’s 1.4 billion population – with, as of 3 February, an infection rate of less than 21,000, a death toll of 425 in China, and outside of China reported two, one in Hong Kong, another one in the Philippines.\nExpand these statistics to Europe and you find similar figures. Of course, nobody talks about it. This is an annual occurrence – a bonanza for the western pharma industry. In the west, disease is business. The more the merrier. Once you are in the “medical mill”, it’s difficult to escape. “Specialists’ find always another reason to send you yet to another “specialist” for another treatment. The ignorant patient has no option than to obey. After all it’s his health and life. In China it is the total opposite. The Chinese system does everything for its population’s health and well-being.\nYet, China bashing in one way or another seems to intensify by the day. Yesterday, 3 February, the UN in Geneva has issued an edict that all UN employees returning from China must stay home and work from home for 14 days; i.e., a dictated self-quarantine. And new contracts for Chinese staff will be temporarily suspended. This is all propaganda against China.\nQuarantine is absolutely not necessary. Chinese biologists of the Office of Science and Technology of the city of Wuxi (south-eastern Jiangsu province, near Shanghai) have developed a test kit that can detect the 2019-nCoV virus within 8 – 15 minutes, similar to a pregnancy test. This test kit is available to the world. In fact, it has been used to test an airline crew member arriving from New York at the Zurich airport and feeling ill. Within less than an hour, the crew member was sent home – it was the common flu.\nIn China, where by now scientific evidence is mounting that the disease – like all the coronaviral diseases, including the 2019-nCoV predecessor SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 2002 / 2003 also in China), and its Middle East equivalent, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) are not only laboratory fabricated, but also patented. And so are many others, for example, Ebola and HIV. Both, SARS and 2019-nCoV are not only man-made, but they are also focusing on the Chinese race. That’s why you find very few people infected in the 18 countries where the coronavirus has spread.\nIt sounds like a strange coincidence that in October 2019 a simulation with precisely the coronavirus was carried out at the John Hopkins Institute in the US, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the WEF (World Economic Forum), as well as the Pirbright Institute of the UK, one of the world’s few level 4 (highest security level) bio-warfare laboratories (for more details see “China’s Coronavirus: A Global Health Emergency is Launched. What are the Facts”\nThe west’s ‘demolition’ priority seems to have shifted drastically from Russia to China. Why? Because China is an ever-stronger economic power, soon to surpass the United States in absolute terms. Since mid-2017, China is already number one, measured by the PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) indicator, indeed the most important one, because it demonstrates what people can actually buy with the money.\nChina’s currency, the Yuan, is also advancing rapidly as a reserve currency, gradually replacing the US-dollar. When that happens, that real money, like the Chinese Yuan, based on a hard economy and covered by gold, against a “fake” fiat currency (based on nothing), like the US-dollar, is taking the lead, then the US-dollar hegemony is broken and the US economy doomed.\nTo prevent that from happening Washington is doing everything possible to destabilize China – see Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Uyghurs in China’s western Xinjiang Province, Tibet, the infamous Trump-inspired “tariff war” – and now the new coronavirus outbreak. The death toll is at present about 2.1% (of total cases of infection), down from 2.3% a week ago.\nBut that and the constant bashing with negative western propaganda, travel bans, border closures, flight bans – and more – plus the disease itself, the medical care, work absenteeism, medication and medical equipment, not to forget the specially-built 1,000-bed emergency hospital in Wuhan – and an 8% average decline at the Shanghai stock exchange, bear a considerable economic cost for China. So much so, that the People’s Bank of China (PBC) has recently injected some 1.2 billion yuan (about US$ 174 million equivalent) into the economy.\nThis new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, may just be a trial. Imagine a stronger mutation of a coronavirus would be implanted into the Chinese population, say with a mortality rate of 10% to 20% or higher. It could cause real havoc. However, a stronger version may not be so easily controllable and directable; i.e., towards the Chinese race, and may risk spreading to the Caucasian race as well – meaning the executioner would risk committing mass suicide.\nRemember the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the deadliest in history, infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide – at that time about one-third of the planet’s population – and killed at least 50 million people (a death rate of 10%), including some 700,000 Americans.\nWhile preparing for the worst, because Washington – with the help of its level 4 bio-war lab – will not let go easily, China’s approach of endless inventive creation, avoiding conflicts, will outlive the aggressor.\n• First published by the New Eastern Outlook – NEO\nThis article was posted on Saturday, February 8th, 2020 at 6:59pm and is filed under \"The West\", China, Health/Medical, United States."}, {"url": "https://es.news-front.info/2020/03/31/como-funciona-el-karma-es-posible-que-el-covid-19-sea-un-proyecto-exitoso-de-los-estados-unidos/", "title": "How Karma Works: Could COVID-19 Be a Successful Project in the United States?", "text": "Western European countries such as Italy, Spain and Germany have become the main epicenters of the spread of coronavirus infection just after China, and on March 24, the WHO announced that the United States became the new focus of the spread of COVID-19 (there are currently 142,735 infected people in the United States).\nIn the context of the rapid spread of the coronavirus in the United States and the accompanying decline in economic activity, confirmed by the American President, the Trump Administration is acting confidently in the framework of anti-Chinese policy: citing diplomatic sources , says NBC News, that the Administration requires that the fact of COVID-19's \"Wuhan origin\" be included in the UN resolution.

Of particular interest is the geographical location of these laboratories: these are the countries of western and central Asia: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Georgia. Note is also taken of the agreement signed in 2005 between the Ukrainian Department of Health and the United States Department of Defense, according to which “to help Ukraine prevent the spread of technologies, pathogens and knowledge located at the Institute of Epidemiology and Hygiene Research in Lvov, as well as other facilities in Ukraine, defined by the Ukrainian Department of Health, which can be used in the development of biological weapons, in accordance with the provisions of this agreement, the Department of Defense of the USA it provides grants in the amount of cash allocated to achieve this objective to the Department of Health of Ukraine. ”\nThe next major object is the Place Laboratory, also known as the Georgia Research Center in Tiblisi, which is operated by the Georgia National Center for Disease Control and Public Health and is the US investment project. Aimed at Creating a Strategic Military Facility The laboratory is studying especially dangerous infectious diseases, but it hides the real reasons for its research, which may indicate the possibility of developing biological weapons. The Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, Nikolai Patrushev, and numerous representatives of the Russian Foreign Ministry repeatedly made statements about the danger associated with the activities of this center. The available data suggests that the main vectors of the direction of the bacteriological threat emanating from the United States are Russia and mainland China.\nGiven the facts given, let's try to hypothesize that the new coronavirus pneumonia is a provocation of the US, An American military development, introduced through biological weapons laboratories located in West Asia to destroy the main rival from the USA: China. The objective of introducing such a means of struggle might initially not only be to eliminate the constant threat of the increasing economic influence of the 'Celestial Empire', but also to reap the greatest benefits from the trade agreement that was supposed to be concluded with China: later All in all, it was much easier to agree to an economy weakened by the coronavirus that had hit its main driving force, in conditions that were not entirely beneficial to Beijing. In this case, it was already an ethnic war carried out with the use of new bacteriological weapons. Trump's traditional attacks on China add fuel to the fire, an attempt to accuse her of launching the global pandemic is Trump's typical \"best defense is attack\" game.\nHowever, now that political intrigue is gaining fresh momentum and the United States is falling into the hole it made for its rival, what does the global superpower have to do next?\nOn March 29, a source from the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation said that Russia was concerned about the United States' military and biological activities in neighboring countries, which were being implemented in Pentagon-funded laboratory trainings, and insists on clarifying the purpose of these labs.\n\"As for the 'US footprint' in the appearance of COVID-19, we don't have that information for today,\" said a source at the Foreign Ministry. “However, for a long time we have been observing with concern the United States' military and biological activities taking place in the vicinity of our borders. In our neighboring countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia, and this last border with China, there are biological laboratories created with Washington's money and with the participation of business travel specialists from there, ”he added.\nItalian political expert Tiberio Graziani, president of Vision & Global Trends International Institute for Global Analysis, in an interview with News Front correspondents, commented on the situation as follows:\n“Currently, with reference to the laboratory creation of the coronavirus, as a bacteriological weapon, there are no certain elements to affirm it. The fact that these theories or assumptions are executed in various media and social networks is a demonstration of the frustration of those who write or disseminate them. However, it must be emphasized that alleged conspiracy hypotheses of this type actually create a smokescreen that prevents serious, peaceful and articulate debate on global epidemics.\nIn my opinion, the question of such health crises cannot be reduced to an ideological confrontation. However, this should not be an alibi for not investigating military laboratories that develop bacteriological weapons, \"Grziani said.\nThe conclusion suggests itself: of course, we must not prematurely put conspiracy theological ideas into the mass consciousness of the civilian population. However, the question of the open and legal operation of laboratories is one of the main worrying issues on the political agenda of government agencies in all countries of the world community. Joint efforts should be made to study the activities of biological material research centers, with the ideological and financial support of the United States of America. One of the priority tasks is to give the Lugar Tbilisi laboratory an international status, which will allow independent experts from Russia, European and Western countries to fully participate in its activities and learn about all the nuances of the experiments. This will increase the chances of preserving the right to a secure existence of citizens in nearby territories.\nSource OSCE staff attempted to violate coronavirus restrictions 10 times in Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics"}, {"url": "https://elhmra.com/article-63654", "title": "Canadian site: US soldiers may have moved SK to Chinese Wuhan", "text": "Ahmed\nPosted on 09/04/2020 20:26\n| Last edited 04/04/2020 20:28\nA report published on the Canadian website concluded that the United States may unintentionally stop the emergence of the new Corona virus \"Covid-19\" in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\nAnd a former Professor at the University of Shanghai, Larry Romanov, stated in a report published by the Canadian Globalresearch, that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered last summer to close a large military biological laboratory at Fort Detrick base in Maryland, in anticipation of possible leaks.\nAfter the move, the United States last August witnessed a wave of pneumonia and similar diseases, and this was attributed to the repercussions of electronic cigarettes, but this hypothesis raised the suspicions of some experts.\nAfter that, media and activists in China reported that five of the Americans who participated in the international military games competitions hosted by Wuhan last October were infected with unspecified infection.\nChinese sources suggested that this mysterious disease was in fact \"Covid-19\", which he transferred to Wuhan, an American military, and he may have been infected by an accident that was not announced in Fort Detrick, and he was not diagnosed because of the absence of any concrete symptoms."}, {"url": "https://www.wattan.net/ar/news/300358.html", "title": "Russian politician accuses the United States of being behind the outbreak of \"Corona\" virus", "text": "Russian politician accuses the United States of being behind the outbreak of \"Corona\" virus\nWatan: The leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, accused the United States of being behind the spread of the new \"Corona\" virus worldwide.\nDuring a meeting with students and professors at the Institute of World Civilizations in Moscow today, Saturday, Zhirinovsky said that the new virus is spreading at a tremendous speed, from one continent to another.\n\"The situation will calm down within a month ...

It contained a US violation of the treaty because of its involvement in an activity related to the development of an offensive biological weapons program It is stored in Sierra Army Depots, in northern California and possibly in other regions.\nIt is noteworthy that the then US administration introduced \"Article 817\" to the articles of the Patriot Act, 2001, which allows the government to develop and store biological weapons and their release systems without restrictions, that is, practically canceling the texts of the international agreement signed on it.\nRead more in the quick news section\nWhat is striking and disturbing is what was \"foretold\" by the then Deputy Minister of Internal Security, Daniel Gerstein, addressing the aforementioned international conference, 2012, that his country \"expects an epidemic to spread at the end of 2013\". The diagnosis was shared by Dr. Joseph Kim at the Enuvio Vaccine Production Company.\nThe official American prediction of a pandemic before it occurred raised a range of questions and speculation about the dangerous extent of the biological weapons program and its threat to the lives and welfare of large numbers of people.\nThe Hollywood community accompanied it with the production of a movie called Contagion in 2011, which revolves around a pandemic caused by bats, according to the prepared scenario, which is currently taking place with the Corona epidemic in China, which is likely to be the source of the virus in Wuhan Province.\nIn the context of the American \"prediction\", China was exposed in 2013 to a huge wave of \"avian influenza - H7N9,\" as it immediately began to exterminate millions of chicken birds, and this not only left negative repercussions on its economy, but also at the global level to ban trafficking and dealing with Beijing. We are seeing it happening again these days.\nOn January 31, the US government announced its implementation of \"new measures to combat the Corona virus, including preventing Chinese citizens from entering its territory\"; and applying quarantine to individuals coming from there.\n“Cuba in 1971 was the first country in the Caribbean to announce its exposure to a dengue (dengue) epidemic, believed to originate in Spain.” This was the summary of a medical bulletin issued by prestigious US health institutes, in 2009. Cuba, in turn, accused the US government of spreading the epidemic Its animal wealth from pigs and it was forced to exterminate half a million heads.\nScientifically, the Coruna virus infects the respiratory system of a person, which is similar to the previous SARS epidemic - acute pneumonia - and the origins of the two strains are from animals and have been transmitted to humans, and then to its human brother; , Due to its appearance and spread in Saudi Arabia in 2012, causing severe pneumonia to the patient.\nSome experts in the field of biological sciences suggest that the US government will engage in \"designing a biological attack against China for geopolitical considerations\", coinciding with the spread of \"the new epidemic and danger\" with the Chinese New Year celebrations to paralyze the Chinese society, a large majority of whom will use transportation to return to their original villages.\nProfessor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, Richard Eberat, expressed to the Washington Post his doubts about the American source because \"the genome of the virus and its properties do not indicate that it is the kind produced in vitro.\"\nThe newspaper and US circles have been accused nearly a year ago of developing China 's biological weapons at the Wuhan facility for \"engaging in espionage activities to obtain biological components.\"\nIt was recorded earlier this week that a federal court directed an indictment against Harvard professor Charles Lieber “and two persons of Chinese nationality for their attempts to smuggle 21 tubes inside of biological material into China”, and Lieber receives a monthly reward of $ 50,000 from Wuhan Technical University, according to the indictment .\nWhat strengthens the hypotheses of the American source of the virus is the Trump administration’s policy of fighting China by all means, starting with trade wars, and also exposing it to a series of “deadly bacterial attacks and viral diseases, and symptoms targeting both livestock and humans.”\nThe Epidemiologist at the Rand Institute, Jennifer Bowie, confirmed the close link between the two epidemics (SARS and Corona), as the \"compatibility ratio between them is at least 70% of genetic material and mechanisms for transmission.\" The mortality rate for those infected with SARS was about 10%, compared to 3% for the Corona virus.\nBowie praised the transparency of scientists and the Chinese government and the “sharing of international scientific edifices with the genome data of the virus,” and reached them to find the causes within a short period of time, not exceeding a few days, which will contribute to developing an effective vaccine soon.\nThe American epidemiologist, Dina Grayson, expressed concern about a set of facts surrounding the Corona virus, especially from the high speed of its spread from one person to another, \"it is not only contagious, but kills the infected.\" Grayson has long experience in developing drugs to treat the Ebola epidemic.\nIt is worth noting that Corona virus is a US product with distinction, according to the registry of invention submitted in 2015, which was approved in 2018.\nIn the same context, there are strange \"separate\" incidents that targeted China originating in North America; the most prominent of which was a shipment arrival issued by Canadian biological laboratories, in the month of March 2019, including \"malicious viruses\", the Canadians claimed to be \"part of the research efforts to support public health research In the world.\" It is worth noting that this shipment was carried out under the veil of secrecy, in contrast to the usual procedures, which prompted the Chinese side to file a formal complaint in this regard.\nA large US military delegation, consisting of 300 people, arrives in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China on October 19, 2019, to participate in a military games festival hosted by China and held there. On November 2, 2019, the first infection with the Corona virus was recorded in that province, and it later spread rapidly in December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days.\nThe cost of what China has suffered as a result of the epidemic is prohibitive by all measures: disruption of flights and the movement of trains and other transportation at the height of its largest and most important annual holidays; Everyday life and tremendous business exchanges with the world.\nUltimately, who can answer the question about who benefits from all this can reach the heart of the matter: waging wars with biological weapons at a lower cost than nuclear engagement.\nSource: Al-Mayadeen"}, {"url": "https://libya24.tv/libya-in-media/278997", "title": "America is still the first suspect ..

Is it a natural virus like regular flu viruses? Or a virus created in the context of biological warfare and out of control.\nAt the same time, the accusations about the country responsible for the deadly corona, and its creation, remain confined between the United States of America and China.\nThis comes as scientists are concerned with the origin of Corona, and some of them confirm that there are no indications of its creation and that it is just a natural virus of known proportions, exposed to a mutation that turned it into a \"killer\" epidemic that has the ability to penetrate human cells. About 5 years ago, he ignited the conspiracy theory of Corona, and greatly clarified the origin and origins of the deadly virus.\n(Origin and name of Corona virus)\nOn November 12, 2015, Nature magazine published a report, stating that American scientists have created in the laboratory a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats, in connection with a virus that causes SARS, the acute respiratory syndrome.\nThe magazine pointed out, that scientists have examined a virus called \"SHC014\", found in the horseshoe bats in China. These scientists combined the surface protein of \"SHC014\" with the SARS virus, and came out with a new virus that provided the surface protein with a structure that helps it penetrate the cells of the human respiratory system. It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\n(Corona virus is flying in the air !!)\nIn the same vein, and in 2013, specialists announced their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells.\nAt that time, they reached a shocking conclusion, saying: Coronary viruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, may be more common than he thinks. For a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course !!\n(China publishes largest corona virus study)\nAnd while scientific articles about the virus are still increasing, whether published or emerging, there are still many unknown regions regarding its origin, for example, in which animals did it originate? Did he grow up in a bat, eat ants, or other wild species ?, And where did he come from, did he come from a cave or a forest in China's Hubei Province?\n(Corona gets out of control in Italy)\nAccording to the Corona Virus Genome Sequence, conducted by Chinese researchers, it was found that the RNA molecule consists of about 30,000 bases containing 15 genes, including the S gene, which symbolizes a protein present on the surface of the viral envelope.\nGenomic analyzes also showed that the Coruna virus belongs to the group of beta-corona viruses, and that it is very close to the SARS virus, which is responsible for the acute pneumonia epidemic that emerged in November 2002 in China's Guangdong Province and then spread to 29 countries in 2003, and caused 774 deaths. It is known that bats of the horseshoe bat were a reservoir for this virus and that small carnivores, such as the masked palm civet animal, may act as an intermediate host between bats and the first human cases of the SARS virus.\nBut how did the deadly Corona virus spread from bats to humans and became so dangerous?\nAmerican scientists say that the destruction of humans by places where animals live, such as forests, as well as the huge number of people who move every day has provided an opportunity for diseases that were limited in nature to be transferred to humans. The focus on bats, as the vector of transmission, is due to the fact that they are the only mammals that can fly, allowing them to spread in large numbers over a wide area, which means that they can house a large number of diseases or their causes.\n(The Italian army transports the Corona coffins for the Holocaust)\nIn the origin, evolution, and infecting of humans with Corona, Andrew Cunningham, Professor of Wildlife Epidemiology at the Society of Zoology in London, revealed that when bats fly, their body temperature mimics fever, and thus the pathogens that have evolved in bats have evolved, warning that the virus will not be affected. Most likely a high body temperature that usually kills viruses.\nCunningham said that the rare cases of viruses spreading from animals to humans can turn into global problems within weeks, due to the ease of transportation through transportation, saying: These days, using transportation and airplanes, you can be in a forest in Central Africa today and in the city of London Tomorrow.\n(The US military may be behind the spread of the Corona virus)\nThis comes as mutual accusations between China and the United States of America about the Corona virus and the way it appears have persisted, and while President Trump has defended the use of the term \"Chinese virus\" to refer to the Corona virus, and said: The virus came from China, I think it is completely appropriate. China added false information that our army had transmitted the virus to it, he added. Instead of engaging in controversy, I said: I will call it a reference to the country it came from! The exchange of accusations, between China and Washington, came on the day when the World Health Organization announced that the number of deaths and HIV infections worldwide exceeded that recorded in China.\nMore than once, America has expressed its objection and protest against the Chinese accusations that it caused the epidemic and its spread, and Washington summoned the Chinese ambassador to express its protest against Beijing's promotion of a conspiracy theory indicating that the United States stood behind the emergence of the virus, and it was very popular on social media. The accusations between them are alive, burning and not over.\nAnd if there is disagreement about the origin of Corona and who created it? There is another disagreement about the period of its continuation and the timing of announcing the end of the epidemic and its affliction? While President Trump suggested that the Corona epidemic would subside in the coming July or August, considering that viruses die in the summer and the temperature rises, researchers ruled this out and also ruled out finding a cure for the virus soon, and said that the duration of treatment will not take less than 12- 18 months despite the start of many international research centers working in it.\nThroughout this period, neither summer nor winter is the criterion for the end of Corona, but reaching a cure is the one that stops its advance."}, {"url": "http://awajelpress.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%85-%D9%86%D8%B1%D8%B5%D8%AF-%D8%A5%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D9%83/", "title": "Global Health: We did not detect HIV infections in Yemen", "text": "Press / follow up accelerators\nThe organization said, through the account of its mission in Yemen, on Twitter, that \"until the moment, no confirmed cases of the new Corona virus in Yemen have been reported.\"\nIn a related context, Muhammad Abd al-Salam, a spokesman for Ansar Allah al-Houthi in Yemen, said that it does not exclude that the Corona virus was an American industry that was out of control until part of it returned to it.\nAbdel Salam, who is the head of the negotiating delegation of Ansar Allah, added via his Twitter account: “This is a hypothesis subject to research.” He stressed that “what is not subject to research is the aggression and siege that Yemen is exposed to under direct American supervision, and the aggression and siege virus is entering its sixth year with an American decision.” ."}, {"url": "https://qazweek.kz/ru/2020/04/06/%D0%B2-%D1%81%D1%88%D0%B0-%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD-%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C-covid-19-%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F-%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%8F/", "title": "Covid-19 creator for China arrested in US", "text": "In February, the famous Harvard biologist Charles Lieber was arrested in the United States.

Shareholders in financial markets are trying to determine the expected scenario. Currently, \"there is a significant depreciation of shares of companies whose sales depend on China. However, prices have risen for the shares of the company that produces medical masks, gloves. At this stage, this process is not substantial and will not have a negative impact on liquidity. \"\nAs for the price of oil, the economist said that with the spread of information about the epidemic, there was a downward trend in world markets, and later - an increase.

This controversy escalated, especially between the United States and China, to the highest levels, as US President Donald Trump described it as a Chinese virus, while Beijing suspected that he was an American. Although scientists and specialists are now busy combating this deadly epidemic, regardless of its source, and some confirm that there are no indications of its creation and that it is a \"natural\" virus known to \"lineage\", it was exposed to a mutation that turned it into a \"killer\" that has the ability to penetrate human cells, except A report published by the American journal, Nature, known for its sobriety, still threw more oil on \"conspiracy theory\" oil. This report was published on November 12, 2015, and reported that US scientists have created in the laboratory a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats in connection with a virus that causes SARS, that is, acute respiratory syndrome. The magazine revealed about 5 years ago that scientists had examined a virus called \"SHC014\", which was found in horseshoe bats in China. These scientists combined the surface protein of \"SHC014\" with the SARS virus, and came out with a new virus that provided the surface protein with a structure that helps it penetrate into the cells of the human respiratory system. It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it. In this regard, specialists spoke before that in 2013 reported their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bat bodies and has the ability to penetrate into human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans. Researchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than previously thought.\" In contrast, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify \"potential risks\". Simon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on the news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: \"If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.\" In October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on \"job promotion\", especially those causing serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans."}, {"url": "http://eg24hours.com/n_5974331.html", "title": "Amir Khan: Corona Virus Linked to 5G Network Test", "text": "Source: Agencies to read the full story from its source\nAmir Khan said via Instagram: \"I don't think the virus came from China.

To really help the Syrians they should demand a lift of Western sanctions, not support them.\nFive cases of coronavirus have now been reported by the health ministry in Syria. The country is subject to a curfew from 6pm to 6am as of March 25. Syria braces itself for a potential medical crisis.\nThe Syrian healthcare sector has been crippled under a “maximum pressure” economic sanctions campaign that has collectively punished the Syrian people for the duration of a war waged against them by the same governments inflicting the catastrophic economic damage. Hospitals and medical care centers have been targeted and occupied by the extremist armed groups throughout Syria, further reducing the Syrian state-ability to deal with the looming threat of an apparently rapacious pandemic.\nSanctions increase the risk of pandemic spread\nAll measures taken against the Syrian government by the UK, US and EU are ostensibly to “protect” the Syrian people. Of course sanctions never protect the people, they deprive the people of basic needs, they decimate essential infrastructure. They are designed to weaken the target state or leadership, to turn the people against the government, to serve US-led foreign policy agendas in the region. Sanctions enable war and destruction, they are taken to bring resistant nations into line with horrifying consequences for the civilian population.\nInstead of lifting sanctions to allow nations like Iran and Syria to combat what is described as a “global pandemic” that threatens the lives of all Syrians and Iranians according to the media hype – the US-led coalition of “humanitarian” intervention is effectively doubling down on their pro-sanction, pro-war rhetoric, as a recent statement from the UK, US, France and Germany has demonstrated. Former UK Ambassador to Syria, Peter Ford, described the statement as a thinly veiled cry of solidarity for Al-Qaeda in Syria, “There is not a word here with which Hayat Tahrir Ash Sham, the dominant jihadi group, would not concur.”\nWhite Helmets weaponize Covid-19 to ensure Syrian people suffer more\nThe Al-Qaeda-linked White Helmets group have sprung into action to defend the sanctions regime and to effectively condemn the huge majority of Syrian people to further misery should the pandemic take hold in Syria. An organisation with a history of collaboration with the US Coalition-sponsored armed groups in Syria, itself funded by the same governments, has been triggered by the billionaire-manufactured PR complex that manages and directs this shadow state construct.\nWe have seen a flurry of activity on their Twitter accounts, their primary platform, promoting the White Helmet “coronavirus” campaign. This is nothing short of cynical exploitation of a world crisis to weaponize it against the Syrian government via an entity that has served this purpose since its establishment, in Turkey, by a former British military intelligence officer, James Le Mesurier.\nThe White Helmets have published a statement calling for sanctions against Syria to be maintained. The statement is based on misinformation and duplicitous narratives including the claim that Syria and Russia are deliberately targeting hospitals, omitting that these hospitals are invariably taken over by the Al Qaeda-dominated armed groups in areas they control – converted into terrorist triage centers, prisons, courts, military centers and torture chambers.\nRaed Saleh, the leader of the White Helmets, was recently given a platform in the Senate to “[feed] the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the talking points that it should adopt.” Saleh’s highly politicized speech is echoed in his tweet, instrumentalising the coronavirus crisis to further amplify the talking points historically and fraudulently used to criminalize the Syrian government while airbrushing Nusra Front/Al-Qaeda from the Syrian conflict landscape.\nWhite Helmets are neither neutral nor humanitarian\nSo, in summary, the White Helmets, a supposedly “neutral” “humanitarian” organisation are sustaining their donors “maximum pressure” campaign against the Syrian people they claim to support. If the White Helmets were anything other than an extremist, propaganda construct implementing the US Coalition “regime change” policy against Syria, they would have demanded a ban on sanctions to enable the country to collectively deal with the coronavirus crisis.\nThe White Helmet organisation should be condemned for effectively enabling mass suffering and death in Syria, not only by providing cover for internationally designated terrorist groups, but, now, for endorsing sanctions that will ensure the perfect conditions for a global pandemic to spread like wildfire through a “hybrid warfare”-decimated nation.\nThink your friends would be interested?

What if it's a war?", "text": "Coronavirus. What if it's a war?\nIn our previous post on the sudden spread of coronavirus, we drew attention to the fact that the unexpected situation allowed China to regain control of a number of sectors of the Chinese economy. Thus, the authorities prevented the possibility of Western and Western banks to control the leading sectors of the Chinese economy.\nBut today this coronavirus \"triumphantly\" travels all over the planet. And this is no longer a successful \"action\" by the Chinese authorities to restore control over the economy. There are already cases of infection in Europe, in France, Italy, Spain, and there are also cases in Austria, Croatia, and the United States. Although Azerbaijan claims that \"everything is clean\", information was spread from Baku a few days ago about cases of infection with the virus. It was not hidden in Iran. The city of Com became the epicenter of the Shiite pilgrimage around the world. A tourist from a \"neighboring country\" has infected Iranian citizens, Iranian officials say. Apparently, there will be cases in other countries as well. The World Health Organization (WHO) is already talking about the threat of an epidemic in the world. And here we pause…\nFor some reason, when the WTO starts speaking in public, it becomes a real disaster, an alarm of evil. As it has been in Africa and in a number of Asian countries. Now the case seems to be different. They also talk about the discovery of coronavirus in Europe and America. Therefore, all the \"tales\" that the Chinese are supposed to be accustomed to eating \"everything that moves\", and that is why everything started in China, now seems to be a lie. Let's pay attention. France suddenly starts talking about the need to dissolve NATO instead of NATO A coronavirus was discovered in France a week or two after the creation of a defense alliance with Russia. Italy has formally called on the EU to lift sanctions against Russia. And again, after a week or two, the virus is discovered in Italy. The United States and Spain are on this list, but only at first glance. There are many problems and issues within these two countries. And these are separate topics.\nArmenia simply cannot feel outside the planet. That is why there is \"interest\" in our country in terms of further development of the situation with coronavirus. The United States, as the whole world knows, inherited from Nazi Germany all the methods of fascist technology to work with \"human matter\" - torture, biological, climatic and psychological weapons. And it has long been accepted by the international community that unknown diseases, such as HIV / AIDS, are born in laboratories and can focus on human DNA. In early February, the idea that the coronavirus was a new genetic, biological weapon was circulating, albeit at an unofficial level. It was thought to be a weapon against the Chinese only, as China is now the main US economic rival. But something is wrong. Well, what does Iran have to do with that? It is unlikely that the carrier of the virus, which went on a pilgrimage to the city of Com, may have been from China, although there are Muslims in China. However, they are not Chinese, not Shiites,\nTrue, now they write that there is already a vaccine against coronavirus. We remembered the American-German film \"V means vendetta\". The plot is classic, American, although the \"ecstasy\" seems to be happening in England. \"Some\" politicians have infected the world by starting with their main enemy and then selling everyone a pre-made magic pill. In any case, in the film, in a certain climax, they sow panacea. World Infectious Diseases and Pill Manufacturers: One Team, One Crime Group\nCompare this plot with the situation around the coronavirus. Creating an effective vaccine in such a short period of time is unbelievable. Unless anyone is volunteering to come up with a pretty template? Readers should discuss the rest and look for conclusions or assumptions, look for the answer to the question. Is it just an epidemic or a biological war?

There have been so many discriminatory episodes around the world that there is already talk of \"chinophobia\" and Chinese citizens themselves have launched a campaign on social networks titled \"I am not a virus\".\nLies have prevailed and have left no room for truth. An example of this has been the video that went viral on social networks where a young woman is seen taking bat soup.\nThese images unleashed a wave of accusations against the Chinese for allegedly causing this epidemic and putting the health of the world population at risk for having strange and bad health and eating habits.\nWhat did not go viral was the statement from the protagonist of that video, influencer Wang Mengyum, who clarified that this video had been recorded 3 years ago in Palau, that is, outside of China, and in a restaurant. He also pointed out that he did not eat the bat soup in an open-air market like Wuhan's, but in a restaurant. And it is that the ingestion of strange animals is more a custom of the tourist who visits Asia than of its own inhabitants.\nAdded to the terror of social networks was the decision of the US government to prohibit the entry of any citizen who has passed through China during the past two weeks.\nChina immediately responded and denounced that the United States \"is creating panic among the world population instead of offering aid\" and that this decision \"contravenes the recommendations of the World Health Organization, which insisted on not imposing restrictions on movement.\" But what interest would the United States have in causing a global panic? At the moment, no one knows. What is certain is that thanks to this virus, the Donald Trump government could stop the Asian giant due to the important influence it has on the international board, for its technological development and the growth of its military capacity.\nThe escalation of tensions\n- Trade war: The first great blow of the Trump administration against the Chinese economy was in March 2018, when the application of million-dollar tariffs to Chinese products that entered its territory began. Trump justified this move because of Beijing's alleged \"unfair business practices\". President Xi JinPing was quick to respond and took similar steps with American products, sparking what some analysts called a \"trade war.\"\n- Blocked Huawei: In May 2019, the US banned American companies from negotiating and providing technology to Huawei, China's leading telecommunications company. For this reason, the new Huawei phones could not use applications such as Gmail, Play Store, Google maps, among others. And it was not the first blow against the Chinese technological giant. Just 5 months earlier, the US had ordered Canada to arrest the vice president of Huawei, who is the daughter of the creator of this company, for the alleged violation of US sanctions against Iran.\n- Hong Kong protests: On March 15, 2019, thousands of protesters in Hong Kong take to the streets to demand an extradition bill from China. Although the bill was withdrawn, the pressure from the street rose more and more, to claim its independence, its separation from China. The Xi Jinping government accused the United States and other foreign powers of fomenting the protests. The US government never hid its position. In late November, President Trump enacted the \"Human Rights and Democracy Law\" in support of protesters protesting for democracy in Hong Kong, protesters who were portrayed as peaceful, but who also caused serious assaults. against people who did not support his cause. The Chinese Foreign Ministry denounced that the Trump law in support of the protesters is \"extremely abominable and harbors absolutely sinister intentions.\"\n- 5G and Siberia Power: while relations with the US were increasingly strained, China moved its chips. On October 31, it launches the 5G system, surpassing the United States, and a few days later it inaugurates a mega-gas pipeline with Russia that will allow supplying this fossil fuel to northern China from Siberia. In addition, it will get Russia to circumvent the sanctions that the US imposed on Europe and place its main export resource on the Asian giant.\n- NATO: The response was immediate. The United States and the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance took advantage of the organization's 70th anniversary meeting to put China in their sights and label it as a challenge that they had to face as an Alliance.\nNeither with the tariff, commercial nor technological war did the US manage to destroy the Asian giant. Curiously, it was a virus that achieved the greatest desire of the United States: to isolate China. Inevitable not to remember the years in which the United States inoculated venereal diseases against 696 Guatemalans during 1946 and 1948, or as when the CIA deployed Operation Mongoose against Cuba to introduce various types of viruses in its sugarcane areas, tobacco fields and pig farms.

For the layman, it is just a stronger mutation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, that broke out in 2002 / 2003, also in China. To be sure, a mutation made in a laboratory. In a US high-security biological warfare laboratory. In other words, both SARS and COVID-19 – among many other bio-war agents – were made in the US.\nAnd now, the chaotic western-style race of private corporations for a vaccine wanting to outdo one another, has begun.\nWho is first to develop a vaccine? – It’s a fierce competition to establish a patent, a monopoly – for a possibly multi trillion-dollar business. Its western neoliberal capitalism at its very worst – or best, depending on the angle from where one looks.\nThere are no words to describe this chaotic fever for profit over human wellbeing. It has nothing to do with health, with healing sick and suffering, possibly dying people. It’s all about money. Hundreds of billions, if not trillion of profit for the pharmaceutical oligarch and their associated research laboratories and enterprises. And even more so, if the WHO-declared “pandemic” (sic) will prompt a forced vaccination campaign, enhanced by military and police surveillance.\nLet’s put COVID-19 in context. As of 23 March 2020 (18:33 GMT), and according to WHO statistics, reported worldwide cases are 372,572; deaths 16,313; recovered 101,373 – a death rate of 4.37%. However, these figures must be considered with caution. In many countries, especially developing economies, accurate testing may be a problem. Test kits are often not available, or not reliable. So, may people who go to the doctor with some flu symptoms are possibly falsely diagnosed as COVID-19 victims, as it serves the publicity hype.\nMiscalculations and false reporting may even occur in the United States. Mr. Robert Redfield, CEO of the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), testified before Congress that CDC does no longer carry out regular tests, that these were carried out at State-level and only in extreme cases. See also this reference form the LA Times of California measures and directives.\nBy comparison, the US CDC estimates that in the 2019 / 2020 flu season in the US alone, some 38 to 54 million people may catch the common flu, and 23,000 to 59,000 may die from it. The vast majority of these deaths will be elderly people above 70-years of age and many of them with pre-health conditions and /or pre-existing respiratory problems. This is pretty much the same disease and death pattern as with COVID-19. Expanding these common flu figures linearly on a worldwide scale would result in hundreds of thousands of flu deaths. In the particularly strong 2017-2018 US flu season, an estimated 60,000 people died from the flu in the US alone. The reader may himself judge whether WHO was justified declaring COVID-19 a “pandemic” — or whether there may have been – just perhaps – another agenda behind it?\nThe vaccine that might eventually be applied to COVID-19, may most likely no longer be valid for the next coronavirus outbreak – which, also according to Mr. Redfield, CDC, will most probably occur. A later virus may most certainly have mutated. It’s quite similar to the common flu virus. In fact, the annually reoccurring common flu virus contains a proportion of 10% to 15% (some times more) of coronaviruses.\nThe effectiveness of the annual flu vaccines is on average less than 50%, not to mention all the potential harmful side effects, they carry along. COVID-19 is very similar to influenza. Will a corona virus vaccine be equally weak in protecting a potential patient from a future infection?\nCooperation instead of competition, doesn’t occur in the west. It’s all profit-driven. With a number of different vaccines from different pharma giants coming on the market, who will tell the patient which one is the best, most suitable for the patient’s condition? It smells like an utter chaotic scam.\nThe real question is – are vaccines – or a vaccine – even necessary? Maybe – maybe not. The production of vaccines is pushed for profit motives and for an important political agenda for a New World Order – that has been planned to change human life as we know it, or thought we knew it. See further explanations below.\nVaccines don’t heal, they may prevent the virus from hitting as hard as it might otherwise do, or not at all, depending on the age, physical and health condition of a person. Worldwide statistics show that usually a person up to the age of 40 or 50, who is infected by the COVID-19, has none or only slight symptoms, nothing to worry about.\nShould symptoms show up, staying home, resting and using traditional, age-old medicine, the same that might be used for the common flu, might be enough to get rid of the virus. This might resolve the disease within one or two weeks. Then, the person will be naturally “vaccinated” against this strand of coronavirus. Elderly people above 65 or 70 may be more at risk and special attention may be in order – separated from crowds, isolation during a two-week quarantine (the incubation period), while the rest of society goes on with life as normal as possible, thereby reducing the huge cost to society.\nChina has brought the COVID-19 pandemic under control without a vaccine, but using common sense and traditional, rather inexpensive medication. What are these regular medicines that are effective and have helped to bring COVID-19 under control in China, without a vaccine?\nThe “Children’s Health Defense” (the Children’s Defense Fund – CDF), an American NGO, founded 1973 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., depicts the current power struggle in France between health official and the country’s leading experts in virology, as representative for the worldwide fight between corporate pharma supported by (bought) governments and international organizations, such as WHO – and renowned scientists. If laid open, it is an eye-opener. See full CDF study.\nFrench Professor Didier Raoult, who is one of the world’s top 5 scientists on communicable diseases, argued that the approach of mass quarantine is both inefficient and outdated and that large-scale testing and treatment of suspected cases achieves far better results.\nEarly on, Dr. Raoult suggested the use of hydroxychloroquine (Chloroquine or Plaquenil), a well-known, simple, and inexpensive drug, also used to fight Malaria, and that has shown efficacy with previous coronaviruses such as SARS. By mid-February 2020, clinical trials at his institute and in China already confirmed that the drug could reduce the viral load and bring spectacular improvement. The Chinese scientists published their first trials on more than 100 patients and announced that the Chinese National Health Commission would recommend Chloroquine in their new guidelines to treat Covid-19.\nIn addition, China and Cuba are working together with the use of Interferon Alpha 2B, a highly efficient anti-viral drug developed in Cuba some 39 years, but little known to the world, because of the US imposed embargo on anything from Cuba. Interferon has also proven to be very effective in fighting COVID-19 and is now produced in a joint-venture in China.\nChinese researchers in cooperation with Cuban scientists are also developing a vaccine which may soon be ready for testing. In contrast to the west, working exclusively on profit-motives, the Chinese-Cuban vaccine would be made available at low cost to the entire world.\nOther simple, but effective remedies include the use of heavy doses of Vitamin C, as well as Vitamin D3, or more generally the use of Micronutrients essential to fight infections, include vitamins A, B, C, D, and E.\nAnother remedy that has been used for thousands of years by ancient Chinese, Romans and Egyptians, are Colloidal silver products. They come in forms to be administered as a liquid by mouth, or injected, or applied to the skin. Colloidal silver products are boosting the immune system, fighting bacteria and viruses, and have been used for treating cancer, HIV/AIDS, shingles, herpes, eye ailments, prostatitis – and COVID-19.\nYet another simple and inexpensive remedy, to be used in combination with others, is menthol-based “Mentholatum”. It’s used for common flu and cold symptoms. Rubbed on and around the nose, it acts as a disinfectant and prevents germs to enter the respiratory track.\nNorthern Italy and New Orleans report that an unusual number of patients had to be hospitalized in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and be put 24×7 on a 90% strength respirator, with some of them remaining unresponsive, going into respiratory failure. The reported death rate is about 40%. The condition is called acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS. That means the lungs are filled with fluid. When this description of ARDS episodes applies, Dr. Raoult and other medical colleagues recommend COVID-19 patients to “sleep sitting up” until they are cured. This helps drain the liquid out of the lungs. The method has been known to work successfully since it was first documented during the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic.\nAs you may expect, if you look up any of these alternative cures on internet – internet controlled by Google and the Big Corporatocracy, including the pharmaceuticals, will logically advise you against using them. At best they will tell you that these products or methods have not proven effective, and at worst, that they may be harmful. Don’t believe it. None of these products or methods are harmful. Remember, some of them have been used as natural remedies for thousands of years. And remember, China has successfully come to grips with COVID-19, using some of these relatively simple and inexpensive medications.\nUnfortunately, few doctors are aware of these practical, simple and inexpensive remedies. They are safe and more often than not successful. The media, under pressure from the pharma giants and the compliant government agencies, have been requested to censoring such valuable information. The negligence or failure, to make such easily accessible remedies public knowledge is killing people.\nNow, let’s cut to the chase, to what’s behind it all – behind the extraordinary monstrous media propaganda hype that is bringing down the entire (western) world’s socioeconomic system, creating untold misery, famine, and death. A misery with suffering potentially by orders of magnitude worse than the Big Depression of 1928 / 1929 and the subsequent years.\nIf anybody had any doubts up to now, where the virus originated, the truth was dropped surreptitiously, a slip of the tongue or on purpose, by Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, when he addressed the Nation on 21 March on COVID-19, he said, “This is not about retribution, we are in a live exercise here…”, meaning military exercise, or a war game.\nPresident Trump by Pompeo’s side was whispering, “you should have let us know”. Whatever that means. It’s hard to believe that Mr. Trump didn’t know. But these are the vagaries of American politics, even on a death-serious subject like the new coronavirus breakout. See here with a brief video. See this also.\nThis live (military) exercise has unimaginable worldwide implications which may completely transform our lives. It’s economic warfare. Almost every country on this planet is on some kind of a lock-down, a quarantine of sorts for an as of yet undetermined period, with businesses closed, shops and restaurants shot, construction sites halted, people working from home if they can, being in the streets is forbidden, in many countries under police and military surveillance, with cases of people being beaten up and hand-cuffed, if they have no good explanation.\nThe President Macron-inspired French police is especially known for its uncontrolled brutality fighting the Yellow Vests. They have already demonstrated their same despise for their fellow citizens, when they are in the streets, even food shopping, without a special permit.\nBorders are shot, airlines are grounded, tourism comes to a screeching halt, basically from one day to the other, stranded throughout the world. With a few exceptions, Germany and France are rare ones, they organize return flights for their citizens abroad. Otherwise, with uncertain flight departures, over-booked and over-crowded flights, the stranded tourists have hardly a chance to return home soon.\nThe socioeconomic cost is astronomical. In the multi-quadrillion, or quintillion; numbers with so many zeros they make you dizzy. This calamity can only partly be valued with numbers, and not now, as the world’s lock-down continues – with a social cost that cannot be valued. The dive of the stock market by about 30% – a typical bonanza for forward speculators and Big Finance, Big Banking, with multi-trillion-dollar losses for the small investors.\nMillions, if not hundreds of millions of small and medium size businesses going broke, unemployment going rampant, in the hundreds of millions, throughout the world, and the poorest of the poor, especially in developing countries, who are either unemployed or survive on small hourly or day-to-day jobs – they have no income, cannot buy the basics for survival – some of them may die from famine, others may commit suicide, others convert to crime. This is Greece by a factor of thousand, or worse.\nThen, there is a moral and societal breakdown from a forced quarantine, for which there is no clear end in sight. This creates fear and anxieties, frustration and anger. For many it’s like solitary confinement – all of which is bad for health, and lowers the immune defense system. Just what those who pull the strings want.\nSo, whom does this live (military) exercise serve? – First one would assume its destined to break China’s back, as China is the up-and-coming economic power. It is true, China’s economy has suffered enormously, with about 60% to 70% of all production stopped for the first two months this year, the time of the COVID-19 outbreak and peak, meaning a significant plunge of China’s GDP, maybe as much as 40% for January and February 2020.\nHowever, China has the corona virus now firmly under control. And China being China, her economy is recovering fast and may soon be back to what it was in December 2019. In fact, despite the significant impact of COVID-19, China’s economy may soon overtake that of the self-styled empire, the United States of America. China’s currency the yuan, is solidly backed by a strong economy and by gold, and is slated to become the world’s chief reserve currency, replacing the US-dollar, which had that role for the last 100 years. When that happens, the US hegemony is doomed.\nIt’s more. This attack on China is actually backfiring big time. China is the supply chain for almost everything for the west. To increase corporate profits, the US and other western countries have outsourced almost everything to low-cost labor China. This concerns not only high technology electronics, but also medication and medical equipment. About 80% and ingredients to produce medication come from China. For antibiotics the proportion is about 90%.\nWith much of Chinese production halted for almost 2 months, the delivery lag is enormous.\nA plan has been on the drawing board for the last few years, dictated by the obscure clan, or “Deep Dark State”, and designed by its minions, who expect to be generously rewarded in one way or another. Or, you may put it this way, the absence of punishment and torture is also a form of reward.\nUniversal Vaccination\nFirst, there is an enormous drive towards universal vaccination, because vaccination will be the cornerstone of all that follows, namely a universally imposed electronic identification of every person on the planet. And what is best suited to force down a vaccination program? – A pandemic, of course, with people being made more scared every day. The fear factor is key. It is being increased by a time-undetermined quarantine and by a constant drip-by-drip indoctrination of bad news on the COVID-19 front. Every day the pace of increasing numbers of infected people and those who died, accelerates, increasing fear and anxiety.\nThe time will come, when people will literally scream for help. They want a police and military state to protect them – from the virus, I guess – and they want to be vaccinated. They don’t care nor ask what is the cocktail that is being injected in their body and what its long-term implications may be. For example, the vaccination cocktail could serve to reduce women and men’s fertility, or cause long-term neurological defects that can even be passed on to next generations. People with fear just want to sleep at ease, being vaccinated. They don’t care – nor do they want to know – that along with the vaccine could be a nano-chip injected that will contain all their personal data, from health records to bank accounts – and can be electronically remote-controlled.\nIt goes without saying, our monetary system is planned to be fully electronic, no more cash – cash is poison – or as WHO’s Director General recently warned, not verbatim, but with that meaning, cash is dangerous for infections, paper money and coins may carry deadly viruses – thereby paving the way for full digitization of our monetary system. This has, indeed, already been tested over the past few years, mainly in Scandinavian countries, where entire department stores refuse to accept cash. In response to the WHO DG’s recommendation, some shops and restaurants in Germany refuse to accept cash.\nThe universal vaccination and electronic ID go together and will first be tested in a few developing countries. Bangladesh is one of them. The vaccination program is the platform for the mega-changes the New World Order (NOW), or the One World Order (OWO) wants to bring about. This, in addition to the enormous money-making bonanza.\nAn almost unknown agency called Agenda ID2020 is behind all this, monitoring, directing and adjusting the implementation of the various programs – that are supposed to eventually lead to Full Spectrum Dominance. For more details, see also the recent article on the dangers of Agenda ID2020.\nBehind this elaborate and complex network of things, appears time and again, one prominent name: Bill Gates, the Bill and Melinda Gate’s Foundation. Bill Gates has been funding vaccination programs in Africa for decades. And Bill Gates and the Rockefellers make no secret that one of their ultimate goal for planet earth is a drastic population reduction.\nAbstract of Agenda ID2020\nAgenda ID2020 – is an alliance of public-private partners, including UN agencies and civil society. It’s an electronic ID program that uses generalized vaccination as a platform for digital identity. The program harnesses existing birth registration and vaccination operations to provide newborns with a portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity.\nGAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, identifies itself on its website as a global health partnership of public and private sector organizations dedicated to “immunization for all”. GAVI is supported by WHO, and needless to say, its main partners and sponsors are the pharma-industry.\nThe ID2020 Alliance at their 2019 Summit, entitled “Rising to the Good ID Challenge”, in September 2019 in New York, decided to roll out their program in 2020, a decision confirmed by the WEF in January 2020 in Davos. Their digital identity program will be tested with the government of Bangladesh. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and “partners from academia and humanitarian relief” (as they call it), are part of the pioneer party.\nIs it just a coincidence that ID2020 is being rolled out at the onset of what WHO calls a Pandemic? – Or is a pandemic needed to ‘roll out’ the multiple devastating programs of ID2020?\nHow the Vaccination Research and Production is supposed to work.\nHow will this elaborate and complex business of creating vaccines and implementing vaccine campaign work? As most official activities that basically are government responsibilities are privatized and outsourced, they become complex, chaotic at times and inefficient. In the case of the west, the US pretends to take the lead, but will also assign responsibilities to European pharma-labs.\nThe National Institute of Health (NIH) has overall responsibility for national health research and program implementation. NIH’s Director is Anthony Fauci. The Institute was created in 1955. Under NIH, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), one of 27 institutes, reporting to NIH, is responsible for vaccination programs. NIAD’s mission is to conduct basic and applied research to better understand, treat and prevent infectious, immunologic and allergic diseases. NIAD has outsourced the vaccination program to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).\nCEPI was formed by the WEF (World Economic Forum) in Davos in January 2017. It was founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the London-based Welcome Trust, created in 1936, but including now as members several European countries and the European Union (EU). The BMGF made a first infusion to CEPI of US$ 460 million. CEPI also receives funding from Norway and India and is also heavily supported by the pharma-industry.\nAccording to CEPI’s website, CEPI has appealed for US$ 2 billion to support the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 and to expand the number of vaccine candidates to increase the chances of success and to fund the clinical trials for these candidate vaccines. CEPI’s ambition is to have at least three vaccine candidates, which could be submitted to regulatory authorities for licensing for general use/use in outbreaks.\n“Governments around the world will need to invest billions of euros more in coronavirus vaccine development, to take forward some promising candidates that are emerging. – It’s a very risky business – everything is being done in parallel, you’re not building on the expertise of others – but good progress is being made,” said Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at CEPI.\nCEPI has already some preselected international pharma corporations to research and work on a COVID-19 vaccine. They include the biotech “Moderna” in Seattle, not far from the Microsoft Headquarters – also a Bill Gates creation; the biotech lab Inovio, the University of Queensland, Australia, and the Germans, BioNTech and CureVac.\nFrom the outset it looks that Moderna, CureVac and BioNTech are best suited to produce fast a vaccine, because according to a Health and Science report, published on March 17, 2020, “all three of these firms specialize in messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics. These mRNA molecules are used to instruct the body to produce its own immune response to fight a range of different diseases. This type of vaccine can potentially be developed and produced more quickly than traditional vaccines.”\nEnters GAVI – the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization has also been created by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is a global health partnership of public and private sector organizations, dedicated to “immunization for all”. GAVI is supported by WHO, and needless to say, its main partners and sponsors are the pharma-industry. GAVI has already announced it needs billions of dollars to support its COVID-19 vaccination program. In June 2020, the UK Government will sponsor a donor conference in support of GAVI’s COVID-19 vaccination program, expecting to raise US$ 7.3 billion.\nFrom this maze of overlapping organizations, activities and unclear responsibilities, the money-flow is likely going to be a crisscross that nobody can follow. Accountability on a large scale will be lost.\nAs to the output – hopefully a vaccine – or several vaccines. For the layman and potential patient, it will be a matter of luck (or bad luck) what cocktail of biological substances will be injected into his or her body. In any case, the long-term outcome, is unpredictable. Remember, Bill Gates has been pursuing during the last fifteen or twenty years his own very special agenda. It is unlikely he will abandon it now. Rather COVID-19 and the ensuing vaccination program will allow him to enhance it.\nConcluding – it is amply clear that this is a huge money-making and public-rip-off proposition by the pharma industry. What makes this multi-billion-dollar scam even worse, is that it has an official rubber-stamp, by being supported by western governments and international organizations, foremost WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank.\nThis may be the last opportunity for the elite, the 0.1%, to shuffle social capital and worker funded assets from the bottom to the top, before we enter an era of total control through electromagnetic fields (EMF), managed by the minions of the 0.1% and with 5G / 6G technology, where we, the remaining humans may have become mere tele-guided robots.\nIt is by now a pipe dream to believe that the world may continue as it did until the end of the last decade. It would be too much of a coincidence that Agenda ID2020 started activating its evil programs exactly at the beginning of the decade 2020. Unfortunately, it is also a far-away dream that China and Cuba could lead the way for finding a cure for the most likely recurring coronavirus in one mutation or another – including but not exclusively, using traditional methods and remedies that have proven successful in the current battle to control COVID-19.\nThere are draconian measures on the way, and we may just pray that they fail, or that we, the people, awake in time and in sufficient numbers – a critical mass – and find back to our innermost voice and soul – solidarity for each other that gives us strength to fight this Luciferian monster.\n*\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.

However, seekers sometimes do not see what lies in a prominent place. I want to offer what lies in the most prominent place - on the Internet. This is a document from a decade ago: Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development. The Rockefeller Foundation, Global Business Network. May 2010. (“Scenarios for the future of technology and international development”).\nIt seems to me that the famous antiglobalist, American economist and political scientist, William Engdahl, Princeton University political science, was the first to dig this material. On March 10, he published the article Lock Step, This Is No Futuristic Scenario: Panic and the Post-Pandemic Future? (A step of attachment is not a futuristic scenario: panic and a post-pandemic future?).\nEngdahl makes a sensational statement: ten years ago (!) The script “Pandemic Panic” was prepared, which is being played out before our eyes.\nThe document came out of the bowels of two organizations - the Rockefeller Foundation and the Global Business Network. Most of the projects of the first organization in one way or another are aimed at solving such problems as optimizing the taxes of the Rockefeller clan (a charity fund is exempted from taxes), birth control, reducing the world's population, de-industrialization (under the flag of transition to a \"post-industrial society\"), etc. Recruitment These tasks were determined by the Club of Rome, created in 1968 by David Rockefeller, and was intended to bring the owners of money to their goal - they should become masters of the world (the idea of a world government).\nAs for the Global Business Network, it was founded by Peter Schwartz, who is considered one of the most respected American futurists. Schwartz collaborated with the Pentagon and prepared a 2004 Pentagon Climate Change Report for the US military on global climate change.\nI will briefly outline the main ideas of the document, to which William Engdahl drew attention. Here are four scenarios for the development of the world after the global financial and economic crisis of 2007-2009. The first of them generally coincides with what we are observing today; this scenario was called Lock Step (“The attached step”) in the report. The remaining three in this case do not deserve attention.\nHere is an excerpt from the report: “In 2012, the largest pandemic that the world had been waiting for for many years broke out. Unlike H1 # 1 2009 [swine flu pandemic virus that arose in 2009. - VK], this new strain of influenza spread by wild geese was extremely dangerous. Even some of the countries that prepared for the onset of such a pandemic were affected by the disease, and globally, the virus infected about 20% of the population. 8 million died in the first 7 months after the advent of the new strain. And most of the dead are healthy young people ... \"\nFirst about the mismatches. First, the pandemic began 8 years later. Secondly, they decided to write off not on wild geese, but on bats. Thirdly, COVID-19 does not kill primarily the young and healthy, but the elderly and those with poor health.\nAfter the publication of the report in 2010, it was probably finalized. Apparently, it was decided that young and healthy could still be useful as a cheap and highly productive workforce. And you should get rid first of all of the \"ballast\" - the weak, sick, elderly, the elderly. This is today's version of the Malthusian backstage policy, which at all costs seeks to \"optimize\" the world's population to 1 billion.\nAs for the quantitative indicators contained in the report (the percentage of infected and the absolute number of deaths), then we can only wait for the end of July (if we count the pandemic from the beginning of the year). By the way, Donald Trump says so (and very confidently): the pandemic will end in July-August. After seven months, we will \"count the chickens.\" Some WHO experts suggested that Covid-19 could affect two-thirds of the world's population. German Chancellor Angela Merkel read that 70% of the German population will be infected with coronavirus. I think she comes from the same secret schedules for the operation as Trump.\nThe report talks about the effect of the virus on all aspects of public life. In particular, on the economy: “The pandemic has also had a devastating effect on the economy: the international movement of people and goods has stopped, which has weakened industries such as tourism and broken global supply chains. Even in places, the usual noisy shops and office buildings have been empty for months, without employees and customers. ”\nIt is further stated that the habitually dormant state will wake up and begin to actively fight the pandemic. And he will do it harshly, violating the usual notions of democracy and human rights: “During a pandemic, national leaders all over the world strengthened their powers and established the strictest rules and restrictions - from the obligatory wearing of masks on the face to checking body temperature at the entrances to public places, such as train stations and supermarkets. Even after the pandemic passed, this more authoritarian control and supervision of citizens and their activities remained and even intensified. To protect themselves from the spread of increasingly global issues - from pandemics and transnational terrorism to environmental crises and growing poverty - leaders around the world have come to rule more harshly. ”\nIn this description, made 10 years ago, we, firstly, see what is happening today in almost all countries without exception: the establishment of totalitarian control, in some places accompanied by the formal introduction of a state of emergency (as in the USA), and somewhere and without such formalities. Secondly, it may seem that in a few months the pandemic will end and everything will continue to be the same. However, it follows from the document that there will be no return to former life. It will be announced that the world is entering a period of terrible threats (climate change, international terrorism, viral pandemics, environmental pollution ...), so we must forget about democracy, freedom, human rights, which have been taught for decades, forget about the previous standard of living. Security requires sacrifice.\nThe report of the Rockefeller Foundation and the Global Business Network emphasized that China will be ahead of the pandemic: “Operational orders and mandatory quarantine by the Chinese government for all citizens, as well as instant and almost tight closure of all borders saved millions of lives, stopping the spread of the virus much earlier than in other countries, and making recovery from the pandemic much faster. ”\nFull coincidence with what we see today!\nChina has already stated that it has stopped the spread of the pandemic, that quarantines are slowly being removed and by the middle of the year the country's economic life will fully recover. The UN, WHO and other international organizations highly recommend that governments of other countries study the Chinese experience, hinting that the most important thing in this experience is strict discipline, firm authority and high responsibility of everyone. Hint is being made that the “Chinese ant hill”, led by the Chinese Communist Party, is the most viable model in the face of global challenges. Already today, the notion of an “ideal model” of the state, which we see in George Orwell’s 1984 novel, is widely spread, from the very top. Aldous Huxley called such a society a \"new wondrous world.\"\nIn the “new marvelous world”, one will have to forget not only about democracy and human rights, but also about familiar ideas about the “market economy”. Fierce supervision will be established not only over people, but also over enterprises: “In developed countries, this enhanced supervision took various forms: for example, biometric identifiers for all citizens and more stringent regulation of key industries, the stability of which was considered vital for national interests. In many developed countries, forced cooperation with a set of new rules and agreements slowly but steadily restored both order and, importantly, economic growth. ”\nThe authors of the report, which I am talking about, believe that the authorities will not have any special problems: “At first, the concept of a more controlled world was widely recognized and approved. Citizens willingly surrendered part of their sovereignty - and their privacy - to more paternalistic states in exchange for greater security and stability. ” I do not exclude that such confidence of the authors stems from taking into account the experience of the United States in the fight against “international terrorism”. After the events of September 11, 2001, the Patriot Act was passed in America, which deprived the Americans of many rights and freedoms, and citizens reacted “with understanding” to these measures.\nHowever, some time will pass, and citizens will get tired of the tight control of Big Brother. People will again want rights, freedoms, welfare. The authors of the report warn that the transition to a new model of society will cause great overload for both the lower classes and the upper classes. A hint of this is contained in the name of the script itself - LOCK STEP (you can also translate it as \"step lock\"). Moving toward a new model, the report notes, means \"tighter government control from top to bottom and more authoritarian leadership, with limited innovation and growing resistance from citizens.\"\nIn conclusion, I draw attention to the fact that the report and the LOCK STEP script appeared when the dust of the financial and economic crisis of 2007-2009 had not settled yet. The owners of the money realized that world capitalism could not survive such new crises. And, therefore, it is necessary to begin the forced restructuring of the world on the basis of the post-capitalist model. And so this scenario of a difficult, risky, but saving for the owners of money transition to a new slave system. Preparations for the beginning of such a transition dragged on, but at the end of last year there were signs that a new global financial and economic crisis could break out just about. It was impossible to pull. And from the first days of 2020, the operation LOCK STEP (aka COVID-19) began.\nPhoto: @o_rips"}, {"url": "https://www.blanklytalk.com/%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B3-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%A3%D8%A9/", "title": "New conspiracy theory: Bill Gates behind the genesis and spread of the Corona virus", "text": "New conspiracy theory: Bill Gates behind the origins and spread of the Coronavirus\nRoger Stone suggested on Monday that Bill Gates might have had a hand in creating the Corona virus and spreading the pandemic throughout the world.

This is not a hoax, not a fiction, but most likely a reality that has not yet been documented. Everything sounds logical, if you look at the situation from the point of view of “look for who benefits.” And here we come to the conclusion that the coronavirus was created in the laboratories of the United States, by their special services in order to slow down the growth rate of the Chinese economy, which claims to be the first, and thereby get rid of the main competitor in the market. For the United States, this is vital, since all their power is based on the belief that America is the first economy in the world.\nIn principle, this task, at least in the short term, has been achieved: China has been abandoned from economic leadership, like Japan after Fukushima. If for some reason the American leadership needed it, as a kind of respite or a short-term period when global economic redeployment could be carried out, then the American elites can take advantage of this situation.\nHowever, it is unclear what kind of American elites are in question, since today these very elites in the USA are very fragmented. There are at least two large political camps that clashed in a fierce confrontation. We are talking about globalists led by Democrats and isolationist conservatives led by Trump and his team.\nOn the one hand, China has been an annoyance for globalists all the years before Trump, claiming leadership in the economy. On the other hand, the spread of coronavirus leads to isolationist processes - to the fact that countries and continents began to isolate themselves from each other.\nThe question is the extent of the spread of coronavirus, and not the fact of its spread. Suppose if in Russia, conditionally, several cases of coronavirus are recorded, then the entire territory of Russia on the map is painted over with the color of the coronavirus. And in Italy, for example, 12 thousand infected, but formally there is also a coronavirus, as in Russia. However, the scale is not comparable. This gives away an attempt to “turn the arrows” and blur the problem by taking close attention to the real reasons for the pandemic and creating the appearance that everyone, including the United States, is suffering. It is not surprising that Trump introduced the state of emergency in the country. However, the extent of the problem varies significantly. In the USA there is no the same situation as in China. There is a suspicion that coronavirus hysteria swells to divert eyes from real problems.

On November 2, 2019, the first infection with the Corona virus was recorded in that province, and it later spread rapidly in December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days.\nThe cost of what China has been exposed to as a result of the epidemic is prohibitive by all measures: disruption of flights and the movement of trains and other transportation at the height of its largest and most important annual feasts; and the stricken Wuhan municipality imposed a ban on leaving the town for its residents “except for urgent reasons; Daily and phenomenal business exchanges with the world.\nIn sum, who can answer the question of the identity of the beneficiary of all this can reach the heart of the matter: waging wars with biological weapons at a lower cost than nuclear engagement.\n* Bulletin of the American Research Centers Weekly Report\n* The opinions expressed do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the news network"}, {"url": "https://www.turkeyalaan.net/2020/04/15/%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B3-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7/amp/", "title": "Corona's plot: Is Bill Gates behind the spread of the virus around the world?", "text": "Roger Stone suggested Monday that Bill Gates might have had a hand in creating the Coronavirus and spreading the pandemic throughout the world.\nFormer Donald Trump adviser indicated that an American billionaire, Bill Gates, may have done this so that he could cultivate microchips in people's heads to distinguish between those who tested COVID-19 and were not tested, according to Russia Today.\nStone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: “Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate.”\nAccording to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is related to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain \"mandatory vaccinations.\"\nGates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis such as coronaviruses, to the point of recent talk about Gates' prediction of the disease 3 years ago.\nThe Washington Times also reported that Gates announced earlier this month that his charitable organization would invest billions of dollars in factories that would focus on developing many vaccines.\nSource: RT\nThe Public Prosecution in Egypt decided to imprison a husband who killed his wife, pending investigations, to accuse him of killing her divorced ...\nThe whole world unites to confront the Corona virus through a common concept of sense and the search for safety, ...\nMillions of women and girls are more vulnerable than before to violence, marriage at a young age, and no capacity ...\nThe Turkish company \"Asilsan\" for the electronic military industries, delivered the Turkish security forces, a new batch of mobile systems ...\nTraditional lighting suspended between minarets of mosques in Turkey sends messages urging people to stay ...\nTurkish local reports revealed the steps the government will take to restore life to normal.

It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\nIn this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells.

Italy already overcame the number of active cases in China.\nFurthermore, Italy demonstares sky-high numbers of deaths and total coronavirus cases per a million of population. In aprticular, open sources numbers show that every fourteenth person affected by coronavirus in Italy dies. These numbers cause reasonable questions because there are not so much explanations of the observed crisis in Europe. So, the entire Italian government is disfunctional and demonstrates a criminal negligence, or the available statistics exaggerates the scale of crisis. If one supposes that the Italian government is interested in fueling the hysteria and crisis to achieve some own goals (to support the global campaign in the field or gain tactical economic benefits as additional funding from the EU), it may look that authorities count any virus infection death or even deaths caused some other reasons as coronavirus-caused deaths.\nThe European developments followed the official Chinese declaration of conerns regarding the possibiltiy that the coronavirus outbreak may have been a preplanned action (Beijing blamed the US military) aimed against China and the entire crisis is being manipulated to fuel instability and further.\nThe coronavirus hysteria rapidly expanded into other European countries (even not really affected by the oubreak) and even Russia. The Russian opposition media and representatives of the so-called neo-liberal part of the elite are already cry foul about the supposed coronavirus-related problems. According to them, the country is ‘fully unprepared’ to fight the possible outbreak. These claims are being supported by a large-scale media campaign in the field.\nIt’s interesting to note that all of these happens amid the chaos on the oil market (caused by Saudi agressive actions on it), constitutional reforms in Russia and the escalation of the Iranian-US tensions in the Middle East (Iran is currently suffering from coronavirus-related issues with over 12,000 active cases).\nThe large-scale diplomatic and media efforts to paint the coronavirus oubtreak as a large-scale threat and the timing of developments demonstrate allow to suggest that forces related to the global establishment are intentionally exploiting and fueling the crisis (or even contributed to its start) in order to achieve own goals. The COVID-19 issue is already used to explain the upcoming global economic crisis (which is barely caused by the virus itself), and will likely be used among the tools used to distabilize situation inside the countries opposing the neo-liberal world order: China, Russia and Iran.\nModern “liberalism” (often called “neo-liberalism”) is the ideology of serving to global financial monopolies and market speculators in general. The goal of such “liberals” is to increase their personal level of consumption with the minimal possible intellectual and physical work, using the margin simplification of modern communications and IT technologies, for satisfying their selfish, mainly bodily, desires covering them under the guise of post-modern sophistry. Thus, they swallow public resources undermining the steadily development of the humanity.\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n- China Accuses US Military Of Coronavirus Outbreak\nDonate"}, {"url": "https://arabic.sputniknews.com/art/202002031044415880-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%87%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A6%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B6%D9%86%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%84%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%83%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1/", "title": "Yellow skin is the incubating environment for the virus ...

How true this information is is an open question, but its danger is that this hysteria around the coronavirus can become a trigger for the start of a new Great Depression, which only the lazy have not talked about lately.\nOn the other hand, few people believe in the official information of China, according to which the number of people infected at the time of Saturday is 1,287, of which 41 died, very few. If you try to read the statements of officials between the lines, you can conclude that the epidemic in China has already gone out of control, gradually turning into a pandemic. And indeed, indirectly, this confirms that China has never in recent times actually banned domestic and outbound tourism, and also did not quarantine huge megacities (read more here). But the number of officially voiced infected and dead correlates weakly with this. The authorities of Russia are also rather sluggish about this situation (details here).\n➔ Want to be the first to know travel news and sales? Subscribe to the TOURIST NEWS channel on Yandex.Zen ← click here!\nBy the way, there have already been examples in recent history when a frivolous attitude towards a new infection turned into a planetary pandemic: for example, the most massive pandemic in the history of mankind is considered to be “Spaniard” - a type of flu. At the outbreak of World War I in 1918-1919, around 550 million people, or 29.5% of the world's population at that time, were infected with Spaniard around the world, of which about 50-100 million people or 2.7-5.3% of the world's population died according to estimates. The origin of the Spanish woman is not exactly known, but many consider her homeland as China, as well as the current coronovirus.\nWhy? In fact, everything is trite: in China, especially in its southern provinces (Wuhan is located there), several negative factors historically converged at once. 1) crowding of the population, especially in river valleys, where it discharges all sewage and from where it takes drinking water, 2) a warm climate conducive to the development of various infections, 3) the tradition of the population to eat all kinds of rubbish, and often without heat treatment. So, it has already been established that the first case of the current coronavirus ate raw meat of the kind of snake that feed on bats - incubators and peddlers of exotic viruses. In ancient times and in the Middle Ages, most pandemics also came to Europe from China for the same reason, simply the speed of distribution was significantly lower due to the lack of fast communication channels.\nAnd now back to the promised information about the number of infected and dead in China today. First, the news from marginal publications (although they obviously have forces behind them who want to overthrow China from the economic Olympus), and then official information (although officials always and everywhere try to present the situation in the most favorable light for them). Therefore, it is worth assuming that the truth is somewhere in between.\nSo (the source of halturnerradioshow - however, it is not authoritative and the general public is unknown), according to its data last Thursday: “As of 18:00 UST on January 23, US intelligence sources in China confirm that there are more than 2.8 MILLION infected. And one hundred and twelve thousand (112'000) people died. Main cause of death: multiple organ failure. This is very different from the publicly recorded number of 830 infected and 25 deaths. At the same time, doctors in Wuhan reported yesterday that they had run out of virus testing kits. Thousands of dead are delivered directly to the incinerators. No funeral. No solemn burial. The corpses just burn. We receive information directly from incinerator personnel.\nAs of Thursday, January 23, the Chinese government quarantined a total of 11 cities: Wuhan, Huangang, Echzhou, Chibi, Xiangtao, Qianjiang, Zhijiang and Lichuan:\nTotal - 29 million people. At present, the Chinese military is helping to block these Chinese cities. All of them wear bioprotective suits. The CCP Central Military Commission ordered the Central Command to assist in closing Wuhan in response to social instability due to \"panic.\" The soldiers were equipped with biological protective equipment, they vowed to win the campaign. Armored vehicles are also arriving: Dongfeng EQ2050 armored vehicles, armored personnel carriers and light tanks are moving to strengthen roadblocks.\nEven more surprisingly, Chinese people throughout Zhejiang are ordered to stay in their homes. These are 60 million people who have been ordered to stay where they are, which is not yet official quarantine, but rather strictly formulated advice.\nPeople fall unconscious right in the streets. Shops have long been cleared of food. By this Sunday, a total panic will become inevitable, as people understand that food, medicine and doctors are limited resources and not enough for everyone.\n<...> Nobody currently knows how the epidemic will go on in the world, but in China it is already in full swing. This means that the Chinese economy will collapse. And when China collapses, it will cause a global economic shock wave that the planet will not be able to recover from for decades, ”writes the halturnerradioshow news website.\nNow we give the official information from China at the time of Sunday (however, the publication of official data is 1-2 days late). Thus, according to the central party newspaper Renmin Ribao, as of midnight from Friday to Saturday in China, 1,287 cases of pneumonia caused by a new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been confirmed, including 237 people in serious condition. Gazta refers to the State Health Committee of the PRC. According to the committee, the number of deaths from pneumonia increased to 41. 39 of them were registered in Hubei province (Central China), one in Hebei province (Northern China), and one more in Heilongjiang province (Northeast China).\nDraw your own conclusions ...\nRead other important materials about the new coronavirus pandemic:\n➔ If you were going to China, now this trip will have to be postponed indefinitely.

But is it really that helpful in the fight against the Covid 19 pandemic?\nAlternative to hand disinfection?\nOn the website of the Robert Koch Institute you will find recommendations from the so-called \"Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Prevention\" (KRINKO). There it says: \"Although washing the hands can already reduce the rate of nosocomial infections, depending on the extent of the contamination, the effectiveness is not sufficient, so washing hands is not an alternative for hygienic hand disinfection.\" In addition, alcohol compatibility with rub-in rubbing agents is better compared to the skin on hand-washing preparations proven by clinical and application studies.\nWhen asked about his organization's KRINKO recommendations, RKI President Wieler said in a press conference on March 18 that these were guidelines for staff and doctors in hospitals where hygiene measures were significantly higher than in the home. “Of course you can kill part of the virus by washing your hands. But we're talking about quantities here, we're talking about absolute numbers and quantities and qualities. This means that they reduce the amount of pathogens as much as possible. And by washing their hands well, they can reduce the dose of infections and viruses so much that they play no role in the transmission, ”emphasizes the German veterinarian and specialist veterinarian for microbiology, who advises the German government on the corona crisis.\nZastrow: \"One virus is enough\"\n\"Washing hands doesn't do anything,\" says the hygiene expert Prof. Dr. Klaus-Dieter Zastrow in an Sputnik interview. “With soap and water, you might be able to wash away dirt and a few thousand viruses and bacteria from your hand.

Halting or slowing production has put many companies on the verge of bankruptcy. In Europe, the situation reached a degree of danger that prompted the largest economies in the European Union to talk about nationalizing companies as a measure to save them from the crisis. In addition, Brussels agreed for the first time to suspend the Stability and Growth Pact.\nOn the magnitude of the economic crisis in Europe and how it will change the future of the European Union, EurasiaExpert conducted a meeting with French political researcher, European Parliament deputy for France in 2014-2019 by Emeric Chopard. He said: The globalized economy was based on faith like religion. But the Corona virus ended this belief, and it resolved panic. And in panic, they sell everything to get cash for the black day. The capitalization of companies suffers as does the developing countries from which investment emerges.\nRussia is well prepared for such a situation, given that its economy, albeit globalized, is to a lesser degree than Western countries. For China, this is a big problem. For developing countries that need Western capital, this is also a serious problem. In your opinion, why do the European Union countries not fight this evil?\nThe truth is that the European Union has proved completely ineffective in this crisis. There is no coordinated response to this threat, nor European solidarity. I believe that the European Union, which practically lost its credibility before the health crisis, will emerge weaker than it was. When the virus disappears, we will have to rethink globalization and rebuild Europe. Globalization must not mean giving up on national priorities.\nThe nation, of course, must practice trade wisely, but above all, it must maintain its political, food, energy, medical, legal, and other sovereignty. People must adapt not only to good weather, but to storms and thunderstorms!

The second is the improved relations between the Russians and the Turks economically, politically and crystallized in military coordination in Idlib, northern and eastern Syria.\nBut those who bet on these elements were disappointed to see the rapid and tremendous progress of the Syrian Arab Army in Idlib and the countryside of Aleppo, with direct Russian air support, field participation and coverage of this attack in the face of European, American and Gulf condemnations.\nThe Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov seemed to adhere to the liberation of Idlib with the same degree of Syrian enthusiasm going towards Turkey's condemnation of its delay in its pledges to withdraw the Headquarters for the Liberation of Al-Sham from Idlib and the countryside of Aleppo since 2019.\nThe Americans have used all their means: First, with the military support of terrorism, the incitement of Turkey, the mobilization of the Gulf, and the encouragement of the Israelis to carry out an air raid on targets near Damascus, all of these movements did not help.\nTerrorism continued to retreat from one village to another, giving up until now the areas that had been occupied in Aleppo, about half of a region, and possibly more, amid the continuing and progressing Syrian army attacks.\nHere, the Americans found themselves facing the danger of the collapse of the terrorist-Turkish alliance in Idlib, which means exposing their occupation of the region «Syrian oil wells in the east and north of the Syrians and their base in Al-Tanf in the south, and this means that they might be exposed to military operations from the Syrian Arab army charged with liberating the last grain of soil from his country but Depending on the circumstances and nature of the battles.\nTherefore, the Americans launched distress signals to the Western and Gulf media to depict the Idlib battle as a war to exterminate the Syrian civilians.\nIndeed, the Europeans rushed with an American - Turkish warning of massacres against civilians, trying to invest in the Western custom with the blood of the Syrians.\nDemanding a cease-fire between a sovereign Syrian state and a member of the United Nations, and the Headquarters for the Liberation of Al-Sham, the terrorist organization listed on the terrorism regulations of the United Nations and perhaps with a Turkish army occupying Syrian territory and fighting its state.\nThe Gulf also did not stand neutral in this battle, although it is hostile to the Turkish role, because of its alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Gulf's enemies and is anti-Syrian at the same time.\nTherefore, it was believed that the Gulf countries might stand neutral, but criticized the Turkish role, and attacked what it called the killing of civilians by the Syrian army and demanded a cease-fire, so it matched American, European and Israeli demands.\nHowever, all this American mobilization did not bring the desired benefit from it, which necessitated the necessity of American exploration of alternatives, so they studied the subject of Turkey’s revocation in order to fight the Syrian army, a Russian ally, and found it waiting for them to participate with it. This means the outbreak of an open American-Russian war, so exclude this possibility.\nAnd it seemed that the Israeli raids were not very useful in this field, like the revival of Russia, which has nothing but media arts, whose methods no longer fool anyone. As for the use of the Gulf, it is a matter of humor.\nWithin these data, the Americans called upon their friend the dangerous epidemic, \"Corona\", accusing Iran of causing the killing of individuals from Lebanon, the Gulf countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, who were infected with an infection that moved from neighboring Iranian lands, and they were not satisfied with this extent, and they paid Iranian advisers in Syria who said they had Corona.\nAs for their newcomers, it is what Pompeo announced about the fear of millions of displaced Syrians who are threatened with death due to this epidemic. It is occupied by a Turkish army, confirming that Corona is the last American weapon to prevent the liberation of Idlib after exhausting the roles of terrorism and besieging the Turkish role.\nFor reference, the Americans pressured Turkey, Bahrain, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to stop flights with Iran to inflate its role in exporting corona, and so did they with Lebanon by assigning the forces supporting them to accuse Iran and Hezbollah of exporting corona, which moved to Europe and part of America, Asia and the Middle East.\nWill Corona save American influence in Syria and Iraq and stifle Iran?\nThis is what Pompeo wants, but the countries that are targeted by the rumors of Corona are working to protect their people from the Corona epidemic and another epidemic that is more dangerous than him, and that is the American colonialism that makes great efforts to rejuvenate it."}, {"url": "https://dearborn.org/ar/290791/%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81-%D8%B3%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%B6%D8%AF%D9%91-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7/", "title": "Doctor reveals the secret of immunity against corona!", "text": "Mix\nDoctor reveals the secret of immunity against corona!\nElena Malysheva, the famous Russian presenter and presenter, has enumerated some nutrients that are able to boost the body's immunity to fight the infection of the Coruna virus.\nDuring one of her televised medical programs, Malysheva said: “Food products that contain large amounts of zinc are necessary to activate the so-called killer cells in the body.

What if it's a war?", "text": "Coronavirus. What if it's a war?\nIn our previous post on the sudden spread of coronavirus, we drew attention to the fact that the unexpected situation allowed China to regain control of a number of sectors of the Chinese economy. Thus, the authorities prevented the possibility of Western and Western banks to control the leading sectors of the Chinese economy.\nBut today this coronavirus \"triumphantly\" travels all over the planet. And this is no longer a successful \"action\" by the Chinese authorities to restore control over the economy. There are already cases of infection in Europe, in France, Italy, Spain, and there are also cases in Austria, Croatia, and the United States. Although Azerbaijan claims that \"everything is clean\", information was spread from Baku a few days ago about cases of infection with the virus. It was not hidden in Iran. The city of Com became the epicenter of the Shiite pilgrimage around the world. A tourist from a \"neighboring country\" has infected Iranian citizens, Iranian officials say. Apparently, there will be cases in other countries as well. The World Health Organization (WHO) is already talking about the threat of an epidemic in the world. And here we pause…\nFor some reason, when the WTO starts speaking in public, it becomes a real disaster, an alarm of evil. As it has been in Africa and in a number of Asian countries. Now the case seems to be different. They also talk about the discovery of coronavirus in Europe and America. Therefore, all the \"tales\" that the Chinese are supposed to be accustomed to eating \"everything that moves\", and that is why everything started in China, now seems to be a lie. Let's pay attention. France suddenly starts talking about the need to dissolve NATO instead of NATO A coronavirus was discovered in France a week or two after the creation of a defense alliance with Russia. Italy has formally called on the EU to lift sanctions against Russia. And again, after a week or two, the virus is discovered in Italy. The United States and Spain are on this list, but only at first glance. There are many problems and issues within these two countries. And these are separate topics.\nArmenia simply cannot feel outside the planet. That is why there is \"interest\" in our country in terms of further development of the situation with coronavirus. The United States, as the whole world knows, inherited from Nazi Germany all the methods of fascist technology to work with \"human matter\" - torture, biological, climatic and psychological weapons. And it has long been accepted by the international community that unknown diseases, such as HIV / AIDS, are born in laboratories and can focus on human DNA. In early February, the idea that the coronavirus was a new genetic, biological weapon was circulating, albeit at an unofficial level. It was thought to be a weapon against the Chinese only, as China is now the main US economic rival. But something is wrong. Well, what does Iran have to do with that? It is unlikely that the carrier of the virus, which went on a pilgrimage to the city of Com, may have been from China, although there are Muslims in China. However, they are not Chinese, not Shiites,\nTrue, now they write that there is already a vaccine against coronavirus. We remembered the American-German film \"V means vendetta\". The plot is classic, American, although the \"ecstasy\" seems to be happening in England. \"Some\" politicians have infected the world by starting with their main enemy and then selling everyone a pre-made magic pill. In any case, in the film, in a certain climax, they sow panacea. World Infectious Diseases and Pill Manufacturers: One Team, One Crime Group\nCompare this plot with the situation around the coronavirus. Creating an effective vaccine in such a short period of time is unbelievable. Unless anyone is volunteering to come up with a pretty template? Readers should discuss the rest and look for conclusions or assumptions, look for the answer to the question. Is it just an epidemic or a biological war?

For example, water sources, which are considered a source of life, are so polluted that they are unusable in this country. According to the report, 80 percent of rivers in China have no signs of life due to the activities of industrial enterprises and waste.\nAccording to preliminary data, the terrible virus is transmitted to humans through bats. In the diet of the Chinese population, bats made from bat meat predominate.\nSo we can't help but remember the popular saying: What we eat is hollow!\nThe virus of our doctor\nAs it is known, a few days ago, Istanbul also experienced coronavirus excitement. Later, it became clear that the alarm for Turkey was caused by a computer error of an Azerbaijani doctor's assistant. The patient was registered in the computer system by an Azerbaijani doctor's assistant, and he marked \"accurate diagnosis\" instead of \"preliminary diagnosis\" and the whole country hit each other. A criminal case has been opened against our compatriot.\nIt is gratifying that our specialists have taken such responsible positions in the medical sector of the brotherly country. We hope (!) That our doctors will soon raise the level of \"Semashko\", \"Neftchilar\", \"45\" of Sumgayit, Turkish medical institutions, which are on the way to approaching the world's leading standards, to the health of Turkey.\nTrash cans\nLast week, interesting images of the driver of an ambulance were spread in Baku. While waiting for the doctor, the driver appears to have rummaged through nearby trash cans. He picks something up from the garbage and takes it to the ambulance.\nEven if there is no coronavirus in them, it is clear that there are hundreds of bacteria. The driver uses the car as a \"garbage truck\" to transport even openly wounded patients.\nYes, in this case someone needs to be open and say. But we must keep in mind that no one's material needs, the need and right of others to recover and survive should not be taken away.\nIs early marriage a new problem?\nThe most dramatic incident last week was the strangulation of 16-year-old Fatima Gambarova by her 19-year-old husband, Iman Mammadov.\nSometimes statistics and expert analysis exaggerate the increase in early marriages. But let's admit that this is our mental feature and not a problem of today. For centuries, early marriages were common in this region. There is no serious SOS signal, simply because the official cabins, statistics are not kept systematically and there is no link in the value chain to the dangers of early marriage. On the contrary, today's modern society is more conservative and rational.\nInsects too…\n\"There were no insects, only a cockroach. I don't want to see a boy looking for that cockroach inside my facility in any restaurant.\"\nThis was one of the most interesting announcements of the week. One of the restaurants in Baku, in response to allegations of unsanitary conditions there, said: \"Insects are everywhere. What can we do, let's spend all day chasing them ?!\"\nThis is how coronaviruses spread təxminən\nPressure on personal information?\nA few days ago, honored artist Adalat Shukurov accused the Baku Transport Agency of inaction.\nBNA also did not act lazily, investigated and made public the information about A. Shukurov's violation of traffic rules. BNA spokesman Mais Agayev told the media that Adalat Shukurov had been fined 11 times for violating the rules of stopping and stopping over the past year.\nVery clean! But the BNA's self-defense also needs protection. First, 11 violations a year are not serious enough to be exaggerated. Secondly, it was illegal to publicize information about Adalat Shukurov's violation of the rules. It turns out that tomorrow, anyone who criticizes this institution will see a list of rules that he violated in the media.\nIn the end, about sports\nLast week, elections were held within the framework of the XXVIII next conference of AFFA. The previous leadership regained the right to lead AFFA.\nOf course, with the dynamic development of our football, when our national team has become a European giant, even if a wave of revolutionary reforms begins in the country, what is the need for radical reform in the football industry ?!

To date, the official results of the investigation say that the airliner was shot down by a ground-to-air missile. At the same time, Western experts claim that its launch was allegedly carried out by Donbass militias from the Buk-M1 complex “transferred” to them by Russia.\nThe first hearing as part of this case should be held on March 9th. And from Amsterdam, alarm messages have already begun to arrive. The other day there was information that not everyone will be able to get into the courthouse.

First of all, this applies to persons who arrived from the places of spread of the disease.\nState Duma deputy Anton Morozov has expressed concern over such reports. According to him, Amsterdam can use coronavirus as a reason for another fraud. In particular, under this pretext, participants in the trial from Russia who are ready to present new facts in the MH17 case or act as defenders of accused Russian citizens can refuse to attend the trial. In addition, the West can use the situation with the disease in order to suppress the public speaking of 13 unnamed witnesses who are supposedly ready to give “correct” evidence.\n“From the point of view of the Russian Federation, the main thing is that the court decision is legally motivated and does not contain signs of political commitment,” the parliamentarian stressed, adding that all those who can help establish the truth should take part in the process.\n“From the point of view of the Russian Federation, the main thing is that the court decision is legally motivated and does not contain signs of political commitment,” the parliamentarian stressed, adding that all those who can help establish the truth should take part in the process.\nIndependent expert Yuri Antipov, who has devoted much time to the MH17 case, believes that the West’s official version of the plane crash \"bursts like a soap bubble.\" For more details, see the PolitPazl article."}, {"url": "http://belbalady.net/", "title": "BELBALADY", "text": "Municipal news\nGerman newspaper: «Australia» victim of the new China in my country | BeLBaLaDy\nDespite its support for him ..

It contained the United States' violation of the treaty due to its involvement in an activity related to the development of an offensive biological weapons program They are stored in Sierra Army Depots, in northern California and possibly in other regions. \"\nIt is noteworthy that the then US administration introduced \"Article 817\" to the articles of the Patriot Act, 2001, and it allows the government to develop and store biological weapons and their release systems without restrictions, that is, practically canceling the texts of the international agreement signed on it.\nWhat is striking and disturbing is what was \"foretold\" by the then Deputy Minister of Homeland Security, Daniel Gerstein, addressing the aforementioned international conference, 2012, that his country \"expects a pandemic by the end of 2013\". The diagnosis was shared by Dr. Joseph Kim at the Enuvio Vaccine Production Company.\nThe official American prediction of a pandemic before it occurred raised a range of questions and speculation about the dangerous extent of the biological weapons program and its threat to the lives and welfare of large numbers of people.\nThe Hollywood community accompanied it with the production of a movie called Contagion in 2011, which revolves around a pandemic caused by bats, according to the prepared scenario, which is currently taking place with the Corona epidemic in China, which is likely to be the source of the virus in Wuhan Province.\nIn the context of the American \"prediction\", China was exposed in 2013 to a massive wave of \"bird flu - H7N9\", as it immediately began to exterminate millions of chicken birds, and this not only left negative repercussions on its economy, but at the global level to ban trade and dealing with Beijing. We are seeing it happening again these days.\nOn January 31, the US government announced its implementation of \"new measures to counter the Corona virus, including preventing Chinese citizens from entering its territory\"; and applying quarantine to individuals coming from there.\n“In 1971, Cuba was the first country in the Caribbean to announce its exposure to a dengue (dengue) epidemic, and it is believed to originate in Spain.” This was the summary of a medical bulletin issued by prestigious US health institutes in 2009. Cuba, in turn, accused the US government of spreading the epidemic Its animal wealth from pigs and it was forced to exterminate half a million heads.\nScientifically, the Corona virus infects the human respiratory system, which is similar to the previous SARS epidemic - acute pneumonia - and the origins of the two strains are from animals and have been transmitted to humans, and then to its human brother; , Due to its appearance and spread in Saudi Arabia in 2012, causing severe pneumonia to the patient.\nSome experts in the field of biological sciences suggest that the US government will engage in \"designing a biological attack against China for geopolitical considerations\", coinciding with the spread of \"the new epidemic and danger\" with the Chinese New Year celebrations to paralyze Chinese society, a large majority of whom will use transportation to return to their original villages.\nProfessor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, Richard Iberat, expressed to the Washington Post his doubts about the American source because \"the genome of the virus and its properties do not indicate that it is the kind produced in vitro\".\nThe newspaper and US circles have been charged with developing China for developing biological weapons in the Wuhan facility for a year, for \"engaging in espionage activities to obtain biological components.\"\nIt was recorded earlier this week that a federal court directed an indictment against Harvard professor Charles Lieber and \"two people of Chinese nationality for their attempts to smuggle 21 tubes inside of biological material into China\", and Lieber receives a monthly reward of $ 50,000 from Wuhan Technical University, according to the indictment .\nWhat strengthens the hypotheses of the American source of the virus is the Trump administration’s policy of fighting China by all means, starting with trade wars, and also exposing it to a series of “deadly bacterial attacks and viral diseases, and symptoms targeting both livestock and humans.”\nThe Epidemiologist at the Rand Institute, Jennifer Bowie, confirmed the close link between the two epidemics (SARS and Corona) as \"the compatibility ratio between them is at least 70% of genetic material and transmission mechanisms. The mortality rate for those with SARS is about 10%, compared to 3\" % For Corona virus \".\nBoi praised the transparency of scientists and the Chinese government, and the \"sharing of the international scientific edifice with the genome data of the virus,\" and reached them to know the causes within a short period of time, not exceeding a few days, which will contribute to developing an effective vaccine soon.\nThe American epidemiologist, Dina Grayson, expressed concern about a set of facts surrounding the Corona virus, especially from the high speed of its spread from one person to another \"It is not only contagious, but kills the infected.\" Grayson has long experience in developing drugs to treat the Ebola epidemic.\nIt is worth noting that Corona virus is a US product with distinction, according to the registry of invention submitted in 2015, which was approved in 2018.\nIn the same context, there are \"separate\" strange incidents that targeted China originating in North America; the most prominent of which was the shipment arrival of a source from Canadian biological laboratories, in March 2019, which included \"malicious viruses,\" which the Canadians claimed was \"part of the research efforts to support public health research.\" In the world.\" It is worth noting that this shipment was carried out under the veil of secrecy, in contrast to the usual procedures, which prompted the Chinese side to file a formal complaint in this regard.\nA large US military delegation, consisting of 300 people, arrives in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China on October 19, 2019, to participate in a military games festival hosted by China and held there. On November 2, 2019, the first infection with the Corona virus was recorded in that province, and it later spread rapidly in December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days.\nThe cost of what China has been exposed to as a result of the epidemic is prohibitive by all measures: disruption of flights and the movement of trains and other transportation at the height of its largest and most important annual holidays; and the stricken Wuhan municipality imposed a ban on leaving the town on the population “only for emergency reasons; Everyday life and tremendous business exchanges with the world.\nUltimately, who can answer the question about who benefits from all this can reach the heart of the matter: waging wars with biological weapons at a lower cost than nuclear engagement.\nSource: Al-Mayadeen"}, {"url": "https://www.syria-24.com/451/173600-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AC%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%91%D9%8E%D9%87%D9%85-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B3-%D8%A8%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%91%D9%87-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B4%D9%91%D9%8A-%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%A3%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B6-%D9%83%D9%88%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF-19", "title": "Roger Stone accuses Bill Gates of being behind the outbreak and origin of \"Covid 19\"", "text": "On Monday, Roger Stone accused Bill Gates of having a hand in creating the Corona virus and the spread of the pandemic throughout the world, and a former adviser to Donald Trump noted that the American billionaire, Bill Gates, may have done this so that he could grow microchips in the heads of People have to differentiate between those who were tested for COVID-19 and had not been tested.\nStone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM waves, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: \"Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate.\"\nHe added that Gates and other scientists use the epidemic as a way to grow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations, and according to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is linked to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain \"mandatory vaccinations.\"\nStone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations.\nGates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis such as coronaviruses, to the point of widespread talk about Gates’s prediction of the disease 3 years ago, and the Washington Times reported that Gates announced earlier this month that his charitable organization would invest billions of dollars in factories That will focus on developing many vaccines.\nYou may also be interested in: French scientists: Corona virus can handle a high temperature\nRecord number of new infections Corona in India\nGMT 08:10 2020 Saturday, 25 April Al-Burhan accuses parties of forming \"cells\" within the Sudanese army\nGMT 07:52 2020 Friday, 24 April King Salman confirms that he is in pain to prevent permission to pray in congregation in mosques during Ramadan\nGMT 18:00 2020 Wednesday, 22 April Trump comments on North Korea leader's health, attacking US channel\nGMT 08:59 2020 Friday, 17 April President Abbas stresses that no peace agreement will be signed without the detainees' “whitening” prisons\nGMT 08:38 2020 Friday, 10 April The designated Iraqi Prime Minister affirms that state sovereignty is a red line that cannot be relinquished\nItalian press reports confirmed Tuesday that the French star, Bob Pogba, Manchester United player, is close to returning to his former club Juventus.\nIn a long life that lasted for more than 100 years, an American woman escaped the Spanish flu epidemic and recovered from the new Corona virus and cancer, while her relatives believed that she had \"supernuclear DNA.\" Angelina Friedman was born on a ship ...\nHome stone lasted for a long time and the stars began to create ideas to shine with the muzzle elegantly and in a way that suits their looks.

The coronavirus may not be the end in itself, but only an instrument, one more phase in the silent and stormy struggle between the great powers.\nNew wars\nThe strategic analysis portal TopWar, points out that history has shown that world wars have been unleashed to achieve a rearrangement of the geopolitical system, but also to solve in a \"Malthusian\" way serious social problems such as overpopulation and even stagnation of internal economies, a \"renewal through destruction\".\nHowever, after learning from the failure of Vietnam, the western warrior elite understood that many times the answer is not in conventional warfare. Much less, when trying to hit strategic enemies, read China and Iran, which have nuclear response capacity or high resistance capacity. What is done then? In this case, you go through the limbs, even if the final destination is always your opponent's own heart.\nThe true nature of the disease\nAn interesting fact is that the coronavirus is not a pandemic aimed at causing population devastation, but other types of effects such as the social and economic reengineering of the world. And all without throwing a bomb.\n🚨 BREAKING 🚨 — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) March 11, 2020\n\"We have therefore made the assessment that #COVID19 can be characterized as a pandemic\"-@DrTedros #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/JqdsM2051A\n\"The new coronavirus and relatively recent epidemics are behind in mortality. So the Ebola virus killed more than 40% of infected people. During a SARS outbreak in 2003, about 9% of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome], also known as SARS, \"purple death,\" died in China. Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] 2012–2019 killed about a third of the sick, \"TopWar notes.\nWhen the mortality rate is inversely proportional to the panic caused, and Cuba announces that it already has a vaccine to combat the disease, it is legitimate to think that we are dealing not with a biological weapon, but with a sophisticated tool at the service of psychological warfare.\nWe have been prepared through the world's largest indoctrination machine, the American cultural industry. Millions of people have been modeled so that their unconscious knows what to do in the face of an epidemic that devastates a good part of humanity.\nFilms, series, documentaries constitute \"infinite layers of ideas, images and feelings\" that, as Charles Baudelaire writes, fall \"on our brains as sweetly as light\". Its effect is lasting and although it is believed that they disappear when the screen is turned off, no, they do not.\nHowever, one issue is theory and another is practice. Live and direct, we witness how societies that sold themselves as civic models for the rest of the world, bequeathed us scenes of violence in supermarkets to buy the last roll of toilet paper, irrationally emptied the shelves, their commercial class indiscriminately increases the price of masks, even if this ultimately implies their own ruin. The immigrant is no longer the only threat, but your own neighbor. Irrational violence touches the fibers of the haughty first civilized and European world again, and breaks down the stereotype that violence and aggression are outside its borders.\nI have been to Coles, Woolworths and Aldi in multiple suburbs, the toilet paper shortage is real. — Avid Commentator 🇦🇺 (@AvidCommentator) March 3, 2020\nOne Aldi I went to had no rice or pasta left at all.\nWhile some say this is panic buying, the fact the shelves are still mostly full suggests it's in the very early stages. pic.twitter.com/UHPSB4WMsx\nWhat the coronavirus will leave us\nAs we have already seen with bird flu, and SARS among others, each apocalypse has a behavior. First they rise and then disappear from the media agenda and therefore from the public mind. The same will happen with the coronavirus. However, while the cycle is completed there are several issues that must remain as learned matter.\nNever forget that the project is the destruction of the nation states: at the moment, the WHO works as a great interlocutor for the rest of the world. The States remain as replicators and in this case, as operators of guidelines and policies considered for the entire world. A threat that grows stronger as we are more interconnected, is the perfect front to test increasingly supranational forms of governance.\nCohen praised his invention, saying it was the \"healthiest and most moral bomb ever designed because, when the war ends, the world will remain intact.\" A more lethal coronavirus could be considered a true doomsday weapon. If they built, financed and are waiting in warehouses, the N pumps, what makes us think that they do not do it with a biological weapon. Let us remain vigilant in lethality, not panic. But also, just as we worry about nuclear disarmament, we should ask ourselves where and who are currently experimenting with potentially dangerous strains. Another fact: Google and the Bill Gates Foundation are private enthusiasts of biotechnology.\nBy their words you will know them\nJust as in Edgar Allan Poe's short story, The Stolen Letter, the elite love to expose their plans to make them invisible. He dresses them up as science fiction and fantasy movies. However, they sometimes also carry the forms of multilateral agencies. Christian Lagarde, published in 2012 a report that exposed the serious danger that elderly people posed to the global economy. Lagarde urged, to take vigorous measures to face this problem. Eight years later, by chance, an epidemic broke out that was more deadly in the elderly than the young.

There is also another, less well-known institution, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control, which also conducts research on dangerous diseases, for example, conduct experiments on bats (according to one version, coronavirus could be transmitted to the first sick person in the wet market in Wuhan from contact with the bats )\nThe Daily Mail also refers to another version - allegedly the “zero patient” was Huan Yanlin, an employee of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, who accidentally became infected during the experiments (the Institute itself claims that this person quit back in 2015).\nSecond-line media even called the alleged culprit, who if he had not created the virus himself, he could advise the Chinese on such sensitive issues.\nOn January 28, 2020, one of the world's largest nanotechnology specialists, Charles Lieber, was arrested in the United States. The reason for the interest of the FBI is its participation in the Thousand Talents international program, through which China attracts scientists from all over the world.\nOne of the points of accusation - earlier, Liber in official statements denied participation in this program and the presence of ties with the PRC. But, according to US prosecutors on the basis of hacked email by special services, in 2012, a scientist could sign a contract with ... Wuhan University of Technology.\nThere, Liber allegedly received a substantial salary and research grant in the amount of $ 1 million (part of the amount usually goes to purchase reagents and other expenses, and part to the scientist’s own pocket).\nWhat does the virus have to do with it? Lieber's research area is the medical use of nanotechnology. For example, how, with the help of a nanorobot, a molecular-sized structure, can a medicine be delivered to a diseased cell in such a way that it does not receive an “immune response” (when the body rejects uninvited guests).\nBut it’s easy to assemble a radio transmitter from a radio receiver, and from a doctor-nanorobot a battle virus that, on the contrary, infects healthy cells without provoking an immune response ... At least in theory.\nHowever, we emphasize that all this (as well as the hypothetical participation of Charles Lieber in the research of Wuhan virologists) is only a version, and quite speculative.\nANOTHER OPINION\nMikhail Friben, political scientist:\n- I am not a virologist; I cannot judge the origin of the “crown”. But all this is very similar to the next pogrom campaign in a friendly performance of the Western media. In exactly the same way, exactly two years ago, on the basis of equally “convincing evidence”, the West accused Russia of “poisoning the Skripals in Salisbury,” using this as an excuse to strengthen sanctions.\nChina, although not without loss, was able to stop the epidemic, and while the largest economies in the world are plunging into chaos, it uses this to strengthen its influence in the world. Of course, many do not like it. Hence the attempts to expose China as the culprit and, possibly, impose sanctions against it.

These studies consisted of spreading correct concepts of this virus that reduce fear in humans.\nIn a report published by the American \"Forbes\" magazine, it confirmed that there are some incorrect concepts about the virus, that it is not considered the most prevalent among other pathogens, for example, measles is faster than it is.\nThe death rate from this virus is 2%, which is a very small percentage for the rest of the epidemics such as Ebola, whose death rate reached 50%, as well as the natural flu that kills tens of thousands of people annually in America.\nCorona is not considered a serious matter for the whole world, as it threatens China because it is specifically manufactured to reproduce within the physical environment that carries the chromosomes of the yellow race or the East Asian race, so to speak.\nIt is worth noting that the means of alternative medicine do not cure the corona, and the most important thing is to prevent this virus in the best way that is to wash your hands well and frequently, in addition to not friction with any sick person, because there is no treatment or vaccine at the present time."}, {"url": "https://svpressa.ru/health/article/259735/", "title": "Shock: Americans \"Chinese coronavirus\" was sick in September and hid", "text": "Western media quickly took the stage and presented an “official” narrative about the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which apparently started in China, claiming that it came from animals in the “wet market” * in Wuhan.\nIn fact, the origin of the virus remained unknown for a long time, but now, according to reports from China and Japan, it seems likely that the virus originated elsewhere, in several different places, but began to spread widely only after it appeared on that market.\nMoreover, it seems that the virus did not originate in China and, according to reports in Japanese and other media, may have originated in the United States.\nChinese researchers concluded that the virus originated outside of China\nBy collecting genome samples in China, medical researchers first convincingly demonstrated that the virus did not originate in the seafood market, but had many unidentified sources, after which it was “exposed” to the seafood market, from where it spread everywhere.\nAccording to the Global Times: “A recent study by Chinese scientists indicates that the new coronavirus may have started moving from person to person in late November from a place other than the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\nA study published in ChinaXiv, an open Chinese repository for scientific researchers, shows that the new coronavirus was introduced to the seafood market from another place, and then quickly spread from the market due to the large number of close contacts. The results were obtained after analyzing the data collected throughout China, genome data, sources of infection, and the distribution pathways of variations of the new coronavirus.\nThe study concluded that non-virus patients (null patients) passed the virus on to workers or sellers in the crowded Huanan seafood market, which easily facilitated further transmission of the virus to customers and caused wider spread in early December 2019. \"(Global Times, February 22, 2020).\nThen, the Chinese health authorities - and \"intelligence agencies\" - conducted a quick and large-scale search for the origin of the virus, collecting almost 100 genome samples in 12 different countries on 4 continents, revealing all varieties and mutations. In the course of this study, they determined that the outbreak of the virus began much earlier, possibly in November, shortly after the Wuhan War Games.\nThen they came to the same independent conclusions as the Japanese researchers - that the virus did not originate in China, but was introduced from outside.\nZhong Nanshan, a leading Chinese specialist in respiratory diseases, said on January 27: “Although COVID-19 was first discovered in China, this does not mean that it comes from China. ... he arose in another place, in another country. \"\nThis, of course, raises questions about the actual place of its origin. If the authorities conducted an analysis using 100 genome samples from 12 countries, then they should have had a good reason to look for the source outside of China. This explains why such a difficulty arose in the search for and identification of the “null patient”.\nJapanese media: coronavirus may have originated in the USA\nIn February 2020, Asahi, a Japanese news agency (in print and on television) claimed that coronavirus originated in the United States and not China, and that some (or many) of the 14,000 deaths in the United States caused by influenza could be caused by coronavirus.\nA Japanese TV station report revealing that some of these Americans may have been infected with the coronavirus in an unknown way became “viral” on Chinese social networks, raising concerns and speculation in China that a new coronavirus might have originated in the United States.\nA TV Asahi report from the Japanese corporation said that the US government may not have been able to understand how rampant the virus was on American territory.\nHowever, it is not known whether those Americans who allegedly died of the flu were infected with the coronavirus, according to Asahi. On February 14, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced they would begin testing people with influenza-like illness for a new coronavirus at public health laboratories in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, and New York.\nAsahi TV channel presented scientific documentation confirming their claims, raising the question that no one would know the cause of death, because the US either neglected testing or did not publish the results. Japan escaped the questions of “natural versus artificial” and “accidental versus intentional” by simply stating that a viral outbreak might have occurred for the first time in the United States. The Western Internet seems to have received this information, but Chinese media cite it.\nThese statements stirred up a hornet’s nest not only in Japan but also in China, immediately gaining viral popularity on Chinese social networks, especially after the World War Games were held in Wuhan in October. At that time, the possibility of transmitting the virus from a foreign source was already widely discussed in the reports.\n\"Perhaps the members of the American delegation brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, and there was some mutation with the virus, which made it more deadly and contagious and caused a widespread outbreak this year.\" (People's Daily, February 23, 2020)\nShen Yi, a professor of international affairs at Shanghai Fudan University, said virologists around the world, \"including intelligence agencies,\" are tracking the origin of the virus. It is also of interest that the Chinese government did not close this question. The report said: \"Network users should actively participate in discussions, but preferably rationally.\"\nIn China, it matters. If these reports were nonsense, then the government would have clearly stated this and would have asked people not to spread false rumors.\nTaiwan virologist suggests coronavirus originated in USA\nThen, on February 27, a television news program was released in Taiwan that presented charts and flowcharts showing that the coronavirus originated in the United States.\nThe person on the video is a leading virologist and pharmacologist who conducted a lengthy and detailed search for the source of the virus. He conducts the first part of the video explaining the various haplotypes (varieties, if you like), and explains how they are related to each other, how one should precede the other, and how one type comes from the other. He explains that this is just elementary science and has nothing to do with geopolitical problems, describing, as with serial numbers, that “3” should always follow “2”.\nOne of its main points is that the type that infected Taiwan exists only in Australia and the USA, and since Taiwan was not infected by Australians, the infection in Taiwan could come only from the USA.\nIts basic logic is that the source should be the geographical location with the greatest variety of virus strains, since no strain can arise from nothing. He demonstrated that only the United States has all five known strains of the virus (while in Wuhan and in most of China there is only one - just like in Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, England, Belgium and Germany ) Thus, the thesis is that haplotypes in other countries could come only from the USA.\nKorea and Taiwan have a haplotype of the virus, different from that in China, perhaps more infectious, but much less deadly, which would lead to mortality of only 1/3 of the mortality rate in China.\nNeither Iran nor Italy were included in the above tests, but both countries have now decoded the locally distributed genome and announced that they are different from the varieties in China. This means that they did not come from China, but were necessarily introduced from another source. It is worth noting that the species in Italy has about the same mortality rate as in China - three times more than in other countries - while the haplotype in Iran is apparently the most deadly with a mortality rate of 10% up to 25%.\nDue to the fact that a huge amount of material in the Western media is focused on China, most of the world believes that the coronavirus has spread to all other countries from China. But now it seems to be proven that this is not true. At the time of this writing, at least one case has been identified in approximately 50 countries scattered around the world, and it would be very interesting to examine virus samples from each of these countries to determine their location and global sources and distribution patterns.\nThis virologist further stated that more than 200 cases of \"pulmonary fibrosis\" have recently been reported in the United States, which have led to deaths due to patients' inability to breathe. But their conditions and symptoms could not be explained by pulmonary fibrosis. He said that he wrote articles informing the US health authorities to seriously consider these deaths as a result of the coronavirus, but he was told that the cause of death was electronic cigarettes, and then drowned out further discussion. ...\nA Taiwanese doctor then stated that the outbreak had begun earlier than anticipated, saying: “We have to look at September 2019.”\nHe reported on a case in September 2019 when a group of Japanese went to Hawaii. They returned home infected. They have never been to China. This was two months before the virus outbreak in China, and immediately after the CDC suddenly and completely closed the Fort Detrick biological weapons laboratory, saying that there were not enough funds to prevent the loss of pathogens.\nHe said that he personally thoroughly investigated these cases (as did the Japanese virologists who came to the same conclusion). This may indicate that coronavirus has already spread to the United States, but there the symptoms are officially attributed to other diseases, and, therefore, may be masked.\nThe well-known Chinese news site Huanqiu described one case in the United States when doctors told a woman's relative that she had died of the flu, and the coronavirus was listed as the cause of death in the death certificate. On February 26, an ABC News affiliate KJCT8 News Network reported that a woman recently told the media that her sister had died from a coronavirus infection. A resident of Montrose, Colorado, Almeta Stone said: \"They (the medical staff) informed us that it was the flu, and when I received the death certificate, the coronavirus was listed as the cause of death.\"\nWe cannot determine the number of such cases in the USA, but since CDCs apparently do not have reliable test kits and do little or no virus tests, there may be unknown cases.\nJust for information\nOver the past two years (during the trade war), China has suffered several pandemics:\n- February 15, 2018: H7N4 Avian Influenza.

Corona virus was invented by people, and they especially spread it - in sync with the 5G test. ”\nKhan added: \"I think this is necessary to control the population - to get rid of many of us, especially when they say it hurts the elderly.\"\nIt is noteworthy that this theory is common in Britain, where people burn the towers that have been erected to publish new standards for \"5G\" communications, due to doubts that the emerging Corona virus is transmitted through these towers.\nAmir Khan, 33, of Pakistani descent, fought 39 fights during his professional career, winning 34 of them, compared to 5 defeats.\nSource: Agencies\nRelated\nYou can also read the news in the source from the Libyan newspaper Al-Marsad"}, {"url": "https://journal-neo.org/2020/04/15/who-treats-russophobia-as-the-best-cure-for-covid-19/", "title": "Who Treats Russophobia as the Best Cure for COVID-19?", "text": "The current political elites in the United States and the European Union are attempting to distract the public from their helplessness and failed attempts to stem the spread of the Coronavirus (as, unfortunately, the number of deaths due to COVID-19 is at present higher in the USA and the EU than in Asia!) by blaming Vladimir Putin’s trolls for their own incompetence and by spreading anti-Russia propaganda via media outlets under their control.\nIn the middle of March, the European Commission published a report prepared by the East StratCom Task Force, a part of the administration of the European External Action Service (EEAS), saying that Russian media had deployed a “significant disinformation campaign against the West to worsen the impact of the Coronavirus, generate panic and sow distrust”.\nSo what does Russia’s “disinformation campaign” really entail? The fact is that the EU failed to act and help Italy in its battle against the Coronavirus. Russia, on the other hand, did come to the aid of this member state of the EU, which had been created under the banner of “collaboration and close cooperation” but chose not to join efforts to fight the pandemic. It is noteworthy that the Italian government also asked the US armed forces for help, after all, there are American military bases in Italy. But neither Brussels nor Washington came to its aid, and instead Moscow chose to lend a helping hand.\nHowever, disseminators of anti-Russia propaganda within the EU continued with their Russophobic campaign and began publishing reports about Russia’s “ulterior motives” in media outlets subservient to them.\nOut of all the news sources in Italy, newspaper La Stampa was the most zealous in its efforts. It compared the Russian convoy with aid to the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan and said, on behalf of all Russophobes, that “80% of the equipment” provided was of little or no use. In fact, the Russian Federation, at the request of the Italian government, had sent 15 transport aircraft with medicine, medical equipment and doctors to Italy. This aid helped Lombardy stem the uncontrollable spread of the Coronavirus in the region.\nIt is thus not surprising that, on 26 March, President of the Lombardy Regional government Attilio Fontana said there was “always someone, jackals” who speculated on these topics. Prime Minister of Italy Giuseppe Conte said that the mere insinuation that Moscow had tried to capitalize on the initiative for its public relations was offensive. Maurizio Marrone, the head of the Brothers of Italy parliamentary faction and member of the council, told TASS that the Regional Council of Piedmont (a region in Northern Italy) had sent an official request for help in their battle against the Coronavirus to Russia.\nNo one is denying the importance of freedom of speech or the press, but the right of media outlets to publish reports of their own choosing cannot be used as an excuse to criticize humanitarian aid provided to those suffering or countries responsible for such efforts. Such behavior is predatory, especially so when such libel is published at the behest of Russophobes from “across the pond” who pay for such reports. In addition, individuals with anti-Russia views who have already “proven their worth” are being used in the current information war. That admissions made to Ukrainian internet publication Obozrevatel lend further evidence to the fact that Ukrainian Russophobes in Italy, among others, are behind La Stampa’s disinformation campaign.\nThe Russian Federation is not the only nation to fall victim to this information war. “While patients, politicians and health experts all over the world appreciate” the commitment shown by 52 Cuban doctors and nurses in Italy during the fight against the consequences of the Coronavirus pandemic, some German media outlets have begun their hate campaign against the volunteers from the socialist island republic. German newspaper Junge Welt has written about this and has pointed out that the Stuttgarter Zeitung and the Mannheimer Morgen had been particularly helpful in the ongoing information war. The article also reproachfully reminded us that only a few weeks ago, “passengers on the Norwegian-British cruise ship MS Braemar,” which had been allowed to dock in Cuba, expressed their gratitude on social networking websites to the Cuban government that came to their aid after a number of nations had denied entry to the vessel. Having endured quite an ordeal on the ship for a number of days, the passengers disembarked in the Cuban port of Mariel where they then received necessary medical help.\nOf course, American experts on the “Russian threat” also did not miss out on their chance to become involved in the information war being waged. They responded to the medical cargo sent by the Russian Federation to the United States in a predictable manner. Although US President Donald Trump called the aid to be provided by Russia to the USA in its fight against the Coronavirus “very nice”, a number of American media outlets saw something sinister in Moscow’s actions. The Washington Post reported some experts on Russia were surprised by the fact that a country, which the United States had imposed sanctions against for interfering in 2016 US Presidential elections and for annexing Crimea in 2014, decided to send its Antonov An-124 (a large civil cargo aircraft) with medical aid to a nation that had referred to the Russian Federation under its current leadership as a “strategic opponent” from a national security perspective. Andrew S. Weiss, an expert who oversees research on Russia at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, commented on the help from Moscow in his Twitter feed by saying: “This is nuts!”. Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars’ Kennan Institute who studies Russian disinformation, tweeted that Russia’s actions were “mind boggling”.\nOnce the news that Moscow would be sending medical equipment to the United States broke, an active discussion among readers on Fox News’s website began. And a few individuals expressed their gratitude for the help to be provided by the Russian Federation.\nIlta-Sanomat, Finland’s evening newspaper, reported that the world had turned upside down since Russia was to help the suffering United States as the Coronavirus pandemic raged on. The article also added that it was only after foreign powers had begun to provide aid that the European Union realized that its member states also needed to help each other.\nIn light of the disinformation campaign that was sparked in response to humanitarian and selfless steps taken by Russia to help in the battle against the Coronavirus pandemic, the author would like to say that freedom of speech and the press, one of the greatest achievements of modern civilization, really ought to encourage individuals to report truthfully and responsibly.\nVladimir Odintsov, expert politologist, exclusively for the online magazine “New Eastern Outlook“."}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3193562627324590&set=p.3193562627324590&type=3&theater", "title": "Roman Voitiuk", "text": "See more of Roman Voitiuk on Facebook\nLog In\nor Create New Account\nSee more of Roman Voitiuk on Facebook\nCreate New Account\nor\nNot Now"}, {"url": "https://nabd.com/s/70381964-ffe162/%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%8A-%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85-5-%D8%B3%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA!.-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%82%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9", "title": "International Truth Channel Mystery of a coronavirus that slept 5 years!

When the sounds of the revolutions escalated in Britain later in 1895: “Bread, bread, bread,” the answer of the British ruling class was ready: either imperialism or civil war, either allow us to We occupy nations other than you, or we fight a civil war with you that ends in your hunger and death. This is what happened and is happening to this day!\nA return to the Chinese Emperor who refused to facilitate import, as Britain imported tea and silk from China, and paid silver instead, which strengthened the Chinese (silver reserve) and boosted China's trade balance.\nThere were two wars Britain fought to break this formula, which led to two trade agreements through which the ports of China were opened against British merchandise by force, the \"Van Gong\" agreement, and the \"Tianjin\" or \"Tiansin\" agreement.\nMany narratives suggest that the export of opium by force to China was one of the goods that crossed during the two agreements, but there is a peculiarity for the export of opium in the agendas of British policy at the time, namely the disruption of the Chinese production wheel. The British problem was based not only on the fort surrounding the Chinese market, but also on the empire's export capabilities.\nThe new empire suffers from a similar crisis. According to official statistics issued by the International Trade Organization, the volume of trade exchange between the United States of America and China reached 737 billion, of which 557 billion was imported to the US market from China, not outside it. Today, China has $ 1.2 trillion in debt owed by the United States of America (new silver stock).\nPerhaps the new American empire does not have the direct options of the British Empire to reduce the size of Chinese exports to the world and its control over the markets, but it - and from its position as a brutal global power - is able to work hard to disrupt the production wheel, albeit temporarily, at the opponent.\nCorona, Uyghur, and Huawei are the US triangle of two-way action: disrupting production at home or disrupting consumption at the other end (the markets).\nSome people may think that the corona-to-virus ratio is an exaggeration in conspiracy theory, and we believed in our first observations of ancient science fiction films, including \"resident Evil\", that this could not become reality one day!\nThe statements issued by the Health Organization regarding Corona, as a pandemic or an international emergency, have not been contradicted and there is no need to prevent travel to the countries of origin with it. In any case, the limits of infection with the virus did not reach what qualifies it to describe the epidemic, such as the case of the Spanish influenza virus in 1918, which claimed a third of the population of the earth, but the Western media machine used its full capabilities to make the virus - regardless of its origin - a good opium to disrupt exports. Chinese.\nIt is not enough to intimidate the markets of goods infected with the virus, but it is also accompanied by a \"moral\" discourse that talks about suppressing Muslims in China, and this speech targets a wide group of consumers in the eastern markets.\nThe American used to reflect all political discourse and speeches into a \"dollar\". In American foreign policy, this \"pro-Uighur\" rhetoric (regardless of the reality of the Uighurs reality in China) equals $ 15 billion in exchange with Pakistan, $ 45 billion with Indonesia, and $ 244 billion with Arab countries.\nIn this context, it was not strange for Google to activate the Android war with Huawei, in the context of disrupting it for some time from the most urgent task, which is 5G Networks, and its involvement in the task of developing an alternative operating system as soon as possible. It protects the giant from a surprising loss in the mobile phone market.\nThe crisis of the United States of America is not very different from the British crisis in the opium wars, but the tools of direct wars are no longer available today, and there is a need for much opium in the near future, starting from bacterial wars, and not ending with technological and media wars."}, {"url": "https://www.khaberni.com/news/%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B3-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-343107", "title": "Khbrani website: New plot: Bill Gates behind Corona's spread", "text": "Tell me - Roger Stone suggested on Monday that Bill Gates might have had a hand in creating the Coronavirus and spreading the pandemic around the world.\nFormer Donald Trump adviser indicated that American billionaire Bill Gates might have done this so he could grow microchips in people's heads to distinguish who was tested for COVID-19 and not tested.\nStone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM waves, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: \"Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate.\"\nHe added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to sow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations.\nAccording to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is linked to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain \"mandatory vaccinations.\"\nStone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations.\nGates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis such as coronaviruses, to the extent of recent talk about Gates's prediction of the disease 3 years ago.\nAs the Washington Times reported, Gates announced earlier this month that his charitable organization would invest billions of dollars in factories that would focus on developing many vaccines."}, {"url": "https://hamrinnews.net/world/3479496.html", "title": "The page is not available", "text": "Sorry the page you are trying to reach is not available, in case of inquiries you can contact us Hamrin News"}, {"url": "https://www.saadaonline.net/", "title": "Echo online", "text": "Arab News\nArab News\nAfter the arrival of an Emirati plane ... the opening of the medical isolation center in Sayyun to confront Krorna\nEducation: the permanent return to school directorates and departments\nArab News\nAfter recovering from \"Corona\" ..

Lobby and by Bill Gates, the first prophet of the pandemic in 2015.\nThe 10 mandatory vaccine project was carried out in 2017 (Lorenzin Decree) by former Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, ally of Soros and now EU Commissioner, according to the wishes of the Democratic Party.\nIt should be remembered that the PD government was born with Matteo Renzi, who by another arcane coincidence with the blessing of the former US President on February 22, 2014, on the very day that Viktor Ianukovich, Russian-friendly president The lawfully elected Ukraine was forced to flee the coup on Warp Square, even with sniper shots at the crowd, which caused 104 deaths.\nThis happened with a shootout similar to that attributed to a secret CIA operation in Caracas in 2002 when the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, was later arrested by the American special districts and later through the local cardinal for the massive counter-revolution of the loyal population.\nAmong the victims of the Maidan Square massacre in Ukraine on February 20, 2014 were 87 demonstrators, but also 17 police officers, who demonstrated that the mysterious assassins were certainly not from the government police, as the revolutionaries claim instead.\nDuring the protests, the rioters were piloted by CANVAS (Belgrade's closed Faust Otpor center founded by the CIA in Belgrade during the Balkan War), who openly boast of this coup and that of Georgia on their official website (Rose Revolution, 2003 ). As an Italian war reporter found, some of these snipers were indeed of Georgian nationality.\nIndeed, there are more and more coincidences that would horrify Leroy Jethro Gibbs, the legendary federal agent of the successful television series NCIS (Naval Criminal Investigative Service), for whom \"no coincidences exist\".\nWhat does all of this have to do with the severe acute respiratory SARS-Cov-2 syndrome when the current pandemic was renamed, which reached 8% mortality in Italy and increased the death toll to over 5,400 in the past few hours?\nFirst, it emphasizes that the so-called Deep International State, the hidden Masonic, financial, political, and military entity that was recently unveiled and \"praised\" by a former CIA director for dem extraction, does not pose any major problems for \"human security.\" “To cause harm” to pursue its geopolitical goals.\nSecond, we may never know ...\nBecause a recent military operation conducted with maximum confidentiality protocols removes traces of a possible link between bacteriological research developed by Pentagon contractors, the Department of Defense headquarters in Washington, and the violent pandemic that broke out in Italy ...\nThe most recent mysterious operations are the mass burnings of the CoVid 19 deaths carried out by the Italian army for the emergency situation in Lombardy, and particularly in Bergamo, without first performing the autopsies necessary to reveal the viral genomic identity.\nIn Wuhan, scientists performed autopsies on some of the deceased and discovered two genotypes of the corona virus: the \"S\" with intense morbidity but very low mortality and the \"L\" very aggressive with very high infectivity and lethality, resulting in a \"reshaping\" of the previous caused by human intervention: according to the hypothesis of doctors for the consequent therapies, according to that of intelligence analysts for an earlier \"modeling\".\nScientific research should focus on this primary \"trail\", but all Italian doctors, of whom 4,000 have been infected, are too busy to face the challenges with crowded hospitals of people who are positive for CoVid-19, and therefore are previously performed sample autopsies an infinitesimal number and insignificant. While in the defense sector ...\n\"Mowing Sewn\" is the only comment that a civil protection officer in the field today, a former military officer with many years of experience in foreign missions and emergencies due to NBCR (Nuclear Bacteriological Chemical and Radiological) attacks, is training after adding the indiscretion report Crematoria would even have \"group burnings\". Since it is not permitted to ask the Commissioner for emergencies during the daily civil protection press conferences in Rome, these and other doubts remain open.\nSo far, two military pillars have left the province of Bergamo, accompanied by the Carabinieri with a dozen trucks, to carry out a first transport of 60 coffins to the crematorium of Modena on March 18 and another of 70 to that of Ferrara on March 21. Further subsequent trips with the dead to be burned were made in Piedmont to the Serravalle Scrivia, Trecate and Domodossola plants. Evidently, the relatives of the victims were prevented from seeing them and celebrating the funeral rites for the emergency decrees on the risk of infection.\n«In Lombardy there are many factors that contribute to this data: the average age, the population density - we have to consider this virus as an opportunist: before we explain the dead, it is important to do an autopsy and be able to say what died is the patient », said the virologist Maria Rita Gismondo, but as I said, doctors and health care facilities are just enough to cope with the emergencies of the living, which are often included in the emergency room in the Yellow Code because of severe respiratory insufficiency.\nThe US secret service CIA uses contractors under private law\nBut on a quick trip we see all suspicious military missions, among which the search and spread of the increasingly probable bio-weapon could nest. To do this, we are resuming the investigation by Bulgarian journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva, who discovered the weapons that the CIA delivered to ISIS from her friend Al Baghdadi and which we mentioned in our first report on February 4th related to bio -genetic bacteriological weapons or more capable of attacking one ethnic group more virulently than another: as is the case in Italy and Iran ...\n“US bio-laboratories are funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) under a $ 2.1 billion military program (Cooperative Biological Engagement Program, CBEP) and are located in former Soviet Union countries such as Georgia and Ukraine in the Middle East. The journalist from Southeast Asia and Africa »reported that he had pointed to at least 25 research centers, which according to the Russian secret service would instead be at least one hundred.\nIt was one of the first to land under the eyes of all the world's media: the Pentagon Lugar Center in Georgia. It is just 10 miles from Vaziani US Air Base in the capital, Tbilisi. The military program includes biologists from the U.S. Army Medical Research Unit-Georgia (USAMRU-G) and private contractors. The Level 3 Biosafety Lab is only accessible to U.S. citizens with a security permit. They are granted diplomatic immunity.\nVT has spoken about it in two previous reports and in the Department of Defense (DTRA), which is the ingenious “diaphragm” between the Pentagon, a government that is subject to national and international law, and “contractors” or private companies based on that Industrial patent privacy and military secret restrictions can operate outside of any political control. Among the American companies that have worked at Lugar for years, three are the best known: CH2M Hill, Metabiota and Battelle.\n\"In addition to the Pentagon, these private contractors are performing biological research for the CIA and various other government agencies,\" added the Bulgarian reporter, also referring to the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), which launched a special experimental area for bacteriological weapons in 2014 called Biological Technologies Office (BTO), in the framework of which the \"Insect Allies\" project was developed in order to use it officially through genetic bioengineering modifications in the fight against agricultural pests, but not only: according to some experts.\nThe Pentagon has invested at least $ 65 million in gene editing. DARPA has recognized 7 research teams with the development of tools for genome engineering in insects, rodents and bacteria as part of DARPA's Safe Gene program using a novel CRISPR-Cas9 technology.\n\"However, a group of respected, independent scientists revealed in a devastating analysis of the program that the Insect Allies program, far from a\" defensive \"research project, aimed to create and deploy a\" new class of biological weapons \". The scientists, who wrote in the journal Science under the direction of Richard Guy Reeves from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Germany, warned that DARPA's program, which uses insects as vehicles for horizontal genetic modification agents (HEGAAS), revealed : The intention to develop a means of providing HEGAAs for offensive purposes (emphasis added) », the American counter information site UNZ specified.\nWe will primarily analyze Battelle's activities as it is involved in a CIA project and indirectly in a very suspicious incident that occurred at a U.S. military base last July.\nVarious accidents already in the US laboratory\n“Battelle, as a $ 59 million subcontractor at the Lugar Center, has extensive experience in researching bioagents, as the company has been under US bio under 11 previous contracts with the US Army (1952-1966) Weapons program has worked, ”emphasizes Gaytandzhieva in a 2018 dossier from Nature.\n«The private company works for the Pentagon's DTRA bio laboratories in Afghanistan, Armenia, Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. Battelle conducts research, development, testing and evaluation using both highly toxic chemicals and highly pathogenic biological agents for a variety of U.S. government agencies. A total of approximately $ 2 billion in federal contracts were placed, and it is number 23 on the list of the top 100 US government contractors ».\nFrom 1997 to 2000, the Battelle Memorial Institute and the CIA launched the Clear Vision project to rebuild and test an anthrax projectile from the Soviet era and to check the possible spread of this and other bioagents by bombers.\n\"The secret CIA Battelle operation was omitted from the United Nations' biological weapons statements,\" the report supports.\nBattelle has operated a top secret bio-laboratory (National Center for Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures - NBACC) in Fort Detrick, Maryland, under a United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contract for the past ten years. The company received a federal contract from the DHS for USD 344.4 million (2006 - 2016) and another contract for USD 17.3 million (2015–2026).\nThis is exactly the time when the current pandemic's “CIA prophetess”, Avil Haines, was the National Security Advisor to the White House. And this is where the first surprise comes after the Bulgarian journalist's investigation.\n\"It is also important to point out that the major U.S. military laboratories that tested fatal pathogens such as coronaviruses, Ebola, and others suddenly closed in July last year after the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) identified important points. \"Biosecurity holes\" at the facility, »we read in a recent UNZ article about a fact that many other media, including Veterans Today, have reported on in recent days.\n«The establishment of the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Fort Detrick, Maryland - the leading laboratory of the US military for research in the field of\" biological defense \"since the late 1960s - was forced to do all of the research it did with a series of fatal examinations to stop pathogens after the CDC found that their laboratories were most likely to lack \"adequate waste water decontamination systems\" and that personnel did not follow safety procedures, among other things. The facility contains levels 3 and 4 biosecurity laboratories. While it is not known at this time whether experiments with coronaviruses have been carried out, USAMRIID has recently been involved in research resulting from the Pentagon's recent concerns about the use of bats as bio-weapons ».\nIt should not be forgotten that the bat (along with the mongoose) was suspected by scientists as the carrier of SARS-CoV-2 from animal to human, apparently before Chinese chemists discovered the existence of more than just the strange protein \"S modeled\". but also the double genotype of the virus ...\n“The decision to close USAMRIID received surprisingly little media attention, as did the CDC's surprising decision to allow the troubled facility to\" partially resume \"research in late November, even though the facility was\" fully functional \" and is. The problematic security of the USAMRIID in such facilities is particularly important given the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in China. As this report will soon show, this is because USAMRIID has partnered with the Institute of Medical Virology at Wuhan University for decades. »Outbreak of the first epidemic explosion, which now seems to have been almost completely overcome in the country.\nCIA PENTAGON RESEARCH ON CORONAVIRUS\nThe correlations between the two countries are greater than you can imagine: among them there was a study by the Beijing Ministry of Science, which in collaboration with the USAID agency (the government agency for development aid) led to the discovery of 89 bat corona virus strains, which often fund political movements for regime change, as has happened in Syria and Venezuela), the CIA, the Pentagon and the Institute for Health and Human Services in Washington.\nAn Arab Facebook user recently posted a video in French that went viral (and was later blocked by FB) and suspected a European patent from the Pasteur National Research Center at Diderot University in Paris regarding a “new strain of CoronaVirus in Connection with Sars ”already aroused in 2004. However, the controversy was unfounded because it related to vaccine research for the first SARS that hit China and other countries in 2003, but“ only ”814 deaths against the more than 15,000 of the current SARS-2 pandemic.\nHowever, it is important to note that the US Department of Health (HHS), which submitted an American registration, and the usual giant of the GlaxoSmithKline vaccines were among the first to develop these studies, which also targeted new “applications”. The European patent was strangely \"reactivated\" on March 20, 2020, probably as part of research against CoVid-19.\nIt is still the Bulgarian reporter who recalled that \"numerous studies have been carried out as part of the DTRA Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP) to look for deadly pathogens of military importance in bats\".\nOne of them is exactly that on the large strain of CoronaVirus, which includes simple flu, but also SARS and its \"cousin\" MERS, the acute respiratory syndrome in the Middle East, which killed 699 people in June 2017 and 1,980 people in 15 Countries were infected.\n«MERS-CoV is one of the viruses developed by the United States and investigated by the Pentagon, as well as influenza and SARS. Confirmation of this practice is Obama's temporary ban on government funding for such dual-use research in 2014. The moratorium was lifted in 2017 and experiments continued. Experiments with enhanced potential pandemic pathogens (PPPs) are legal in the United States. »Reporter refers to the Rome International Criminal Court (ICC) statute, which instead prohibits it in Article 8, but was never signed by the North American government.\nThe outcome of one of these reaserches was edited in a previous Veterans Today post, which highlighted the risk of human infection with pandemic risk.\nExactly in 2015, however, the Pirbright Institute in the UK launched a new corona virus study to officially prevent avian bronchitis in chickens and registered it with a U.S. patent in 2018, as stated in the first Gospa News report on epidemic.\nWell, among the sponsors of the research center is again the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, sponsor of the Dems and Obama, but above all the research on the new CoVid-19 vaccine from the Australian Queensland University in collaboration with the Usual GSK.\nThere would be a lot to write about the suspicious episodes between the United States and China, including two arrests, which did not, however, determine the purpose of the illegal activity with certainty. As Veterans Today recalled on January 28, Professor Charles Lieber, president of the Harvard Department of Chemical Biology, is arrested for leading a Chinese research team focused on using nanotechnology to identify viruses.\nIn December 2019, a Chinese medical researcher, Zheng Zaosong from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, was instead stopped by FBI special agent Kara Spice, who found him in possession of 21 ampoules that contained a \"brown liquid\" that was \"biological\" appeared to be material ”from a Boston laboratory. His research friend admitted that other comrades had managed to bring samples to China: it is not known whether for biogenetic studies on American samples or through sabotage.\nIn the same month, however, something even more sensational happened between Egypt and Italy when the Naval Medical Resarch Unit called NAMRU 3 was relocated from its historic base in Cairo, where it had been operating at Sigonella's presumed Naval Air Station since 1946, the main military station of the CIA not only in Sicily, but all over Italy ...\nMore on the subject:\nCorona virus: \"Made in China\" or \"Made in USA\"?\nMass Epidemic in China: Corona Virus - A New Development from the Pentagon's Bio Laboratories?\nUS expert: Coronavirus was developed in US bio laboratories\nCoronavirus: Spread from the worldwide US bio laboratories to the world\nBecause of COVID-19: Iranian doctors demand destruction of all US bio laboratories\nGeorgia: US diplomats transport human blood and pathogens to the US bio labs\nNews Front in conversation with Dilyana Gaytandzhieva about US organic laboratories on the border with Russia\nUS global weapons program: Scientists sound the alarm\nUS biological warfare program back in the spotlight Serbs are demanding compensation from NATO for the bombing"}, {"url": "https://pikabu.ru/story/v_ssha_arestovan_sozdatel_covid19_dlya_kitaya_7347339", "title": "Covid-19 creator for China arrested in US", "text": "The Trump administration and the US Congress approved a package of new economic measures to combat the negative effects of coronavirus on the country's economy.\nThere is a decent list, but one of the points is to pay the population $ 1200 per person and $ 500 per child.

Roads to Wuhan are blocked. All transport hubs have military. Submachine gunners in biosecurity create the feeling that this is not real shooting in the 11 millionth megalopolis, but frames from a post-apocalyptic thriller where humanity is dying from an unknown virus. It is people in suits who decide who will fly from China - each side is checked. The slightest suspicion, and instead of the liner - an ambulance.\nThe same biosecurity experts process the house of Daria Kuznetsova every day. She almost does not go out on the street - it makes no sense. Shops do not work.\n“There are enough products so far, but I don’t know how long we can hold on. We are very worried that we don’t know when the city will open,” she said.\nWorst of all - pharmacies are closed. There are not enough medical masks even in hospitals. Primary remedies are sold from under the floor. And this is dangerous.\n\"Some people use masks already used, repack them and resell them,\" says Kuznetsova.\nThere are more than ten cities in quarantine in China. But this will not stop the rapid spread of a new type of coronavirus. Now there are more than 2 thousand infected. More than half are in the Chinese province of Hubei. In total, 1984 people fell ill in China. Four in Australia. Three each - in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea. Two cases each - in Macau, Vietnam and Japan. One is in Nepal. But the virus has already escaped from Southeast Asia. Two infected were found in the United States and three in France. 56 people died.\nAn outbreak of pneumonia began in December. It turned out that the coronavirus, still unknown, was causing it.\nThis family includes 39 species. Spherical microbes containing a single-stranded molecule of ribonucleic acid. The name comes from a shell with rare villi, resembling a crown when an eclipse of the sun. It affects not only a person. More cats, birds, dogs, cattle, pigs and hares. And this increases the speed of spread and emergence of new strains and mutations. Coronaviruses suppress the immune system, it ceases to recognize the infection and fight it.\nRussian scientists have learned the \"genetic code\" of the virus. And a week later they learned to identify it.\nA new pathogen can be detected using molecular genetic analysis. Diagnostics takes place in two stages. The first helps to determine whether a person is infected with a coronavirus at all. The second determines which - perhaps the Chinese strain. Or other options previously known.\nAt first it was believed that the new virus spreads by airborne droplets. But it turned out that he was saved on everything we touch on - money, door handles, elevator buttons. Hello to popular Chinese services that deliver millions of parcels, including to Russia. And the genome of the infection is able to change its structure.\n\"The virus can mutate even during the day. It spreads about as fast as SARS viruses, less efficiently than bird flu, more efficiently than Ebola,\" said the director of the Institute of Medical Parasitology, Tropical and Vector-borne Diseases named after E. Martsinovsky Sechenovskiy University Alexander Lukashev.\nThe first hotbed of infection was the seafood market in Wuhan. How the coronavirus got there is not yet clear. But it was in this city exactly two years ago that the Institute of Virology was opened. They examined highly pathogenic microorganisms that can cause deadly Marburg or Ebola fever.\nScientists have argued before: marine life can transmit infections that are dangerous to humans. One study identified land-based rota- and enteroviruses in 24% of the Black Sea mussels. Snakes and even bats are called as carriers in China - both of them are eaten by local residents.\nThe Chinese themselves a few years ago declared: they are trying to destroy them from the outside. After Wuhan became the focus of infection, colleagues from the PRC called Igor Nikulin, a biological weapons expert, for fear of the artificial origin of the coronavirus.\n“Well, against whom it is directed, we will see in the near future, but judging by the fact that this happened in China, it seems that it is against China. It all looks like a sabotage. First of all, this is the city of Wuhan - it’s the center of the country, a major transportation hub, plus now the Chinese New Year - hundreds of millions of Chinese will travel around the country to relatives, acquaintances, and so on, \"said Igor Nikulin, a former member of the UN Commission on Biological and Chemical Weapons, a military expert.\nOne of those who study the causative agents of deadly diseases most closely is the United States. Dual-use biotechnologies: can be treated, can be killed.\n“It can be beneficial for American corporations that are developing these kinds of new diseases just for profit. Or maybe for the Americans themselves, because America is the only country that has 400 military biological laboratories around the world, not only around Russia, but also around China, in Malaysia, in Indonesia, in the Philippines - the US military everywhere works, \"the military expert explains.\nWe already talked about one of them, the Lugar Center in Tbilisi. Documents confirming the dangerous tests, then published by the former Minister of State Security of Georgia.\n“We see from the documents that 30 people die in one month. 24 of them die in one day. And when you look at the documents, the word“ cause of death ”says“ unknown, ”said Igor Gioradze, Minister of State Security of Georgia, 1993-95. .\nFrom the papers it followed that in the Lugar Center they created, for example, a drone carrying mosquitoes infected with malaria. But this week it became known: American scientists are capable of more. Tufts University and the University of Vermont have created new life forms - xenobots.\nThe stem cells of the African Spur frog turned into programmable biorobots. They are able to move to the goal, carry tiny loads, go without food for a long time and regenerate. One of the authors of the study told us: although they were driven by purely scientific interest, such developments require strict public control.\n\"So far, these biorobots are too simple, but in the future they can be used for military purposes. If they have the opportunity to influence the internal systems of the body in which they find themselves,\" says Sam Krigman, a graduate student at the University of Vermont.\nThe development of a vaccine against Chinese coronavirus, like any other, can take up to several years. And not only because there is a mandatory test and patenting procedure. Every time new types of dangerous diseases erupt on the planet, a war begins behind the curtains of the global pharmaceutical business. There is a demand, that is, infected, and there is a supply.\n“You know, this is such a, let's say, a difficult question, but, in my opinion, it is necessary to divide it here: some pharmaceutical companies are developing vaccines, others are producing medicines. This is the fight against vaccines, it’s to some extent It’s supported by these companies that make these medicines. Well, of course, if there is a vaccine, then why would they be needed at all, \"said Vitaliy Zverev, Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, scientific director of the Mechnikov Research Institute of Vaccines and Serums.\nMany scientists reassure: the situation in China is far from an epidemic. Especially pandemics. But the pace of the spread of dangerous coronavirus infection is accelerating, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Saturday.\nThey are accelerating so much that in Wuhan they began to build a new hospital with a thousand beds. The works are planned to be completed in six days. And tomorrow, groups of tourists will be banned from all over the country. In the outgoing week, all flights from the Middle Kingdom were checked especially carefully. That's how they met planes in Khabarovsk. At Sheremetyevo International Airport - the main flow of passengers from China goes through the capital - double control was established.\nBut the infection still spreads around the world, new foci and new countries - every day. Just the day before, six high-temperature Chinese citizens were hospitalized from a hotel in Moscow. They said: their health worsened after they received packages from China. An examination of the signs of coronavirus did not reveal. But most importantly, the incubation period of the Chinese coronavirus is more than a week. The carrier may not suspect that he is ill and infects others. However, stopping the increase in the number of cases is not the only task. It is important to understand where the infection came from and whether someone could intervene in the ongoing mutations of the virus. If so, humanity has started a deadly game - for a killer the size of a single RNA chain will not make out where the victim is and where the creator is."}, {"url": "http://antifashist.com/item/ne-roj-drugomu-yamu-sam-v-neyo-popadyosh-ili-kak-kitajcy-ukrali-virusy-iz-kanady.html", "title": "Do not dig another hole, you yourself will fall into it!

Or how the Chinese stole viruses from Canada\nMy greatly abridged translation of Tyler Durden's article “Did China Steal Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponize It / China stole the coronavirus from Canada and made weapons out of it” about the situation of the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan.\nIn March 2019, under mysterious circumstances, exclusively virulent viruses from the Canadian NML laboratory ended up in China. This event caused a big scandal when bio-war experts asked why Canada sends deadly viruses to China. Scientists from NML claim that deadly viruses are a potential biological weapon.\nAfter investigating the incident, Chinese NML agents were discovered. Four months later, in July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists was expelled from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory (NML). NML is the only Canadian institution with the highest 4th level of biosafety and one of the few in North America equipped to treat the deadliest diseases in the world, including Ebola, SARS, coronavirus, etc.\nA NML scientist who was escorted from a Canadian laboratory along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese biological warfare agent, Xianggu Qiu. Qiu was the Head of the Vaccine and Antiviral Therapy Section of the Special Pathogens Program in Canadian NML.\nDr. Xianggu Qiu was born in China, where in 1985 she received a medical degree at Hebei Medical University. In 1996, she came to Canada to continue her postgraduate studies. She later collaborated with the Institute of Cell Biology and the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health at the University of Manitoba (Winnipeg, Canada), which does not study pathogens. After 10 years since 2006, she is already studying powerful viruses in the Canadian National Medical Laboratory NML. For example, viruses sent from NML to China were studied by her in 2014.\nDr. Xianggu Qiu is married to another Chinese scientist, Dr. Keding Cheng, who is also associated with NML, in particular the Center for Science and Technology. Dr. Cheng is primarily a bacteriologist who switched to virology. The couple is responsible for many Chinese agents entering the Canadian NML as students from a number of Chinese academic institutions directly related to the China Biological War program, namely:\n- Institute of Military Veterinary Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun\n- Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military District\n- Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei\n- Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing\nAll four of the aforementioned Chinese biological warfare centers collaborated with Dr. Xianggu Qiu in the study of the Ebola virus, the Institute of Military Veterinary Medicine also joined the Rift Valley fever virus research, and the Institute of Microbiology joined the study of the Marburg virus. It is noteworthy that the drug used in the latest study - Favipiravir - was previously successfully tested by the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences under the designation JK-05 (originally a Japanese patent was registered in China in 2006) against the Ebola virus and the like.\nHowever, Dr. Qiu’s research is much more advanced and, apparently, vital for the development of Chinese biological weapons in the case of the inclusion of the viruses Coronavirus, Ebola, Nipah, Marburg or Rift Valley.\nThe Canadian investigation is ongoing, and questions remain as to whether there have been previous deliveries to China of other viruses or other necessary drugs, one way or another, from 2006 to 2018.\nDr. Xianggu Qiu also collaborated in 2018 with three scientists from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases, Maryland, studying immunotherapy after exposure to two monkey Ebola and Marburg viruses; US Agency Threat Reduction study.\nUhanian coronavirus\nDuring the 2017-18 school year, Dr. Xianggu Qiu made at least five trips to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was certified for BSL4 in January 2017. In August 2017, the National Health Commission of China approved studies related to Ebola, Nipah, and Crimea-Congo fever viruses at a facility in Wuhan.\nCoincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located just 20 miles from the Huanan Seafood Market, which is the epicenter of a coronavirus outbreak called the Wuhan Coronavirus.\nThe Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is housed in a Chinese military facility at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, associated with the China Biological War Program. It was the first laboratory in the country designed to meet Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) standards - the highest level of biohazard, which means that it will be qualified to work with the most dangerous pathogenic microorganisms.\nIn January 2018, the laboratory worked “for global experiments with pathogenic microorganisms BSL-4,” Guizhen Wu writes in the journal Biosafety and Health. “After the SARS laboratory leak in 2004, the former Ministry of Health of China initiated the construction of laboratories to preserve high-level pathogens such as SARS, coronavirus and pandemic influenza virus,” writes Guizhen Wu.\nCoronavirus biological weapons\nIn the past, the Wuhan Institute studied coronaviruses, including a strain that causes acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, the H5N1 flu virus, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. Researchers at the institute also studied the microbe that causes anthrax.\n“Coronaviruses (in particular SARS) were studied at the institute and are probably contained there,” said Dani Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who studied Chinese biological weapons.

It contained a US violation of the treaty because of its involvement in an activity related to the development of an offensive biological weapons program It is stored in Sierra Army Depots, in northern California and possibly in other regions.\nIt is noteworthy that the then US administration introduced \"Article 817\" to the articles of the Patriot Act, 2001, which allows the government to develop and store biological weapons and their release systems without restrictions, that is, practically canceling the texts of the international agreement signed on it.\nWhat is striking and disturbing is what was \"foretold\" by the then Deputy Minister of Internal Security, Daniel Gerstein, addressing the aforementioned international conference, 2012, that his country \"expects an epidemic to spread at the end of 2013\". The diagnosis was shared by Dr. Joseph Kim at the Enuvio Vaccine Production Company.\nThe official American prediction of a pandemic before it occurred raised a range of questions and speculation about the dangerous extent of the biological weapons program and its threat to the lives and welfare of large numbers of people.\nThe Hollywood community accompanied it with the production of a movie called Contagion in 2011, which revolves around a pandemic caused by bats, according to the prepared scenario, which is currently taking place with the Corona epidemic in China, which is likely to be the source of the virus in Wuhan Province.\nIn the context of the American \"prediction\", China was exposed in 2013 to a huge wave of \"avian influenza - H7N9,\" as it immediately began to exterminate millions of chicken birds, and this not only left negative repercussions on its economy, but also at the global level to ban trafficking and dealing with Beijing. We are seeing it happening again these days.\nOn January 31, the US government announced its implementation of \"new measures to combat the Corona virus, including preventing Chinese citizens from entering its territory\"; and applying quarantine to individuals coming from there.\n“Cuba in 1971 was the first country in the Caribbean to announce its exposure to a dengue (dengue) epidemic, believed to originate in Spain.” This was the summary of a medical bulletin issued by prestigious US health institutes, in 2009. Cuba, in turn, accused the US government of spreading the epidemic Its animal wealth from pigs and it was forced to exterminate half a million heads.\nScientifically, the Coruna virus infects the respiratory system of a person, which is similar to the previous SARS epidemic - acute pneumonia - and the origins of the two strains are from animals and have been transmitted to humans, and then to its human brother; , Due to its appearance and spread in Saudi Arabia in 2012, causing severe pneumonia to the patient.\nSome experts in the field of biological sciences suggest that the US government will engage in \"designing a biological attack against China for geopolitical considerations\", coinciding with the spread of \"the new epidemic and danger\" with the Chinese New Year celebrations to paralyze the Chinese society, a large majority of whom will use transportation to return to their original villages.\nProfessor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, Richard Eberat, expressed to the Washington Post his doubts about the American source because \"the genome of the virus and its properties do not indicate that it is the kind produced in vitro.\"\nThe newspaper and US circles have been accused nearly a year ago of developing China 's biological weapons at the Wuhan facility for \"engaging in espionage activities to obtain biological components.\"\nIt was recorded earlier this week that a federal court directed an indictment against Harvard professor Charles Lieber “and two persons of Chinese nationality for their attempts to smuggle 21 tubes inside of biological material into China”, and Lieber receives a monthly reward of $ 50,000 from Wuhan Technical University, according to the indictment .\nWhat strengthens the hypotheses of the American source of the virus is the Trump administration’s policy of fighting China by all means, starting with trade wars, and also exposing it to a series of “deadly bacterial attacks and viral diseases, and symptoms targeting both livestock and humans.”\nThe Epidemiologist at the Rand Institute, Jennifer Bowie, confirmed the close link between the two epidemics (SARS and Corona), as the \"compatibility ratio between them is at least 70% of genetic material and mechanisms for transmission.\" The mortality rate for those infected with SARS was about 10%, compared to 3% for the Corona virus.\nBowie praised the transparency of scientists and the Chinese government and the “sharing of international scientific edifices with the genome data of the virus,” and reached them to find the causes within a short period of time, not exceeding a few days, which will contribute to developing an effective vaccine soon.\nThe American epidemiologist, Dina Grayson, expressed concern about a set of facts surrounding the Corona virus, especially from the high speed of its spread from one person to another, \"it is not only contagious, but kills the infected.\" Grayson has long experience in developing drugs to treat the Ebola epidemic.\nIt is worth noting that Corona virus is a US product with distinction, according to the registry of invention submitted in 2015, which was approved in 2018.\nIn the same context, there are strange \"separate\" incidents that targeted China originating in North America; the most prominent of which was a shipment arrival issued by Canadian biological laboratories, in the month of March 2019, including \"malicious viruses\", the Canadians claimed to be \"part of the research efforts to support public health research In the world.\" It is worth noting that this shipment was carried out under the veil of secrecy, in contrast to the usual procedures, which prompted the Chinese side to file a formal complaint in this regard.\nA large US military delegation, consisting of 300 people, arrives in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China on October 19, 2019, to participate in a military games festival hosted by China and held there.\nOn November 2, 2019, the first infection with the Corona virus was recorded in that province, and it later spread rapidly in December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days.\nThe cost of what China has suffered as a result of the epidemic is prohibitive by all measures: disruption of flights and the movement of trains and other transportation at the height of its largest and most important annual holidays; Everyday life and tremendous business exchanges with the world.\nUltimately, who can answer the question about who benefits from all this can reach the heart of the matter: waging wars with biological weapons at a lower cost than nuclear engagement."}, {"url": "https://www.rubaltic.ru/article/politika-i-obshchestvo/19032020-koronavirus-vyzval-katastrofu-pribaltiki/", "title": "Coronavirus caused a catastrophe in the Baltic", "text": "European experts say that the countries of Eastern Europe will face a severe blow since the global crisis of 2008-2009. The peripheral eastern regions of the EU, including the Baltic countries, the coronavirus epidemic will affect most of all. Coronavirus has become a powerful catalyst for crisis trends in the Baltic states: it hit on all the foundations that made up the post-Soviet model of the existence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The potential losses are so great that the Baltic countries can not stand the pain shock.\n“Coronavirus has changed everything. Our initial forecasts have long been a waste paper. The so-called pessimistic (“harsh”) scenario is now more likely to be optimistic, ”according to a press release from the Vienna Institute for International Economic Research (WIIW) on forecasts.\nAs a result of the global coronavirus pandemic, the countries of Eastern Europe will face an acute systemic crisis, comparable to what it was in 2008-2009, and the Baltic countries may not recover from this crisis.\n“Given the high degree of uncertainty, the new WIIW forecasts for 23 countries in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe represent a set of four scenarios for the impact of coronavirus on the economy, including a baseline scenario for development to coronavirus,“ moderate ”(at best),“ medium ” and “heavy” (the worst case scenario). Given the events of recent days, the worst case scenario becomes most likely. In general, under the “difficult” scenario, the region’s growth this year will be 1.1%, which makes this year the worst for the region since the global financial crisis.\nThe “difficult” scenario suggests that the spread of the crisis could be contained by mid-2020 and that the largest economies in the world will take major coordinated political measures. If either of these conditions or both are not fulfilled, the economic consequences will be even more negative and lasting, ”writes the Vienna Institute for International Economic Research.\nA logical question arises: why the epicenter of coronavirus infection in Europe is Italy and Spain, and the worst scenarios are painted in Eastern Europe? By the way, this is not the first time. In 2008, the global economic crisis began in the United States of America, and Latvia suffered the most from the world. Right next to her were other \"Baltic sisters.\"\nThe previous crisis destroyed the myth of the “Baltic tigers”, showing the economic bankruptcy of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, the post-Soviet “success story” of which was built from unsecured financial “bubbles”.\nThe crisis due to the coronavirus completely “nullifies” the entire post-Soviet development model of the Baltic countries, undermining all the components that make up this model.\nIn the economic sphere, the rejection of the “legacy of the occupation” and the “European choice” of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia consisted of a revolutionary redrawing of the structure of the economy, 60% of which in the Soviet period was industry. It was decided to abandon it and go into a post-industrial society, which resulted in the destruction of \"Soviet monsters\" - factories and factories of the industrial era.\nHundreds of enterprises throughout the Baltic states were privatized, fragmented, disposed of, and scrapped. Their place was occupied by the service sector, whose share in the economy has grown to the same 60%.\nIn a state of emergency due to the coronavirus, it is the economically-forming Baltic service sector that is dying first.\nFirst of all, it was not just services that came under attack, but those small, not high-tech and not intellectual services, which Baltic countries chose to specialize in in the 1990s. Cafes and restaurants are closed, tourism is prohibited, only grocery and pharmacies work from shops.\nOther components of the Baltic economy are agriculture and transit. The latter in Latvia and Estonia is already in crisis due to the departure of Russian cargo. Due to the European and probably global economic crisis, which spurs the coronavirus, non-Russian freight traffic will also fall.\nAgriculture in the Baltic states in recent years has been weakened by the war of sanctions with Russia and maintained afloat artificially - mainly through subsidies to farmers from Brussels.\nIn the new situation, the European Union will radically cut back on subsidies for both agriculture and infrastructure projects for the Baltic countries; the estimated scale of the economic losses of the EU countries from the pandemic is such that a complete cessation of subsidies to Eastern Europe is not ruled out.\nMeanwhile, European subsidies are another basis for the economic model of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. While the history of the coronavirus was unfolding in China, Western Europeans had intended to reduce them. Now, when the coronavirus is not primarily about China, but about Europe, and specifically Western, subsidies for leaving BREL (energy ring Belarus - Russia - Estonia - Latvia - Lithuania), the Rail Baltica railway and the like Baltic whim can not just trim, but cut 100%.\nThe “success story” of the Baltic republics, which until recently had been persistently insisted by liberal economists, consisted in achieving outstanding macroeconomic indicators due to maximum savings in social expenses. Social infrastructure was declared another “legacy of the occupation”, which should be “optimized” whenever possible.\nTherefore, the social sphere in the Baltic States has shrunk from year to year like shagreen skin. And including - the health sector.\nHospitals, paramedic centers and maternity hospitals were closed, doctors and other medical staff emigrated en masse, young specialists studied in order to leave for the West immediately after receiving a diploma in medical education.\nOfficial Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn proudly showed GDP growth rates higher than the average European ones, but bashfully kept silent about the worst social statistics in the EU, which went hand in hand with this record growth, about the lowest social protection costs in Europe, for supporting the most vulnerable groups population on the development of medicine.\nResidents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia from this “success story” fled at the very peak of macroeconomic indicators, which poisoned the victorious reports of the Baltic leaders. In the end, they failed to explain the mass emigration of the population in conditions when it becomes better and more fun to live every year.\nSo the longer the “success story” lasted, the more young able-bodied workers emigrated from the Baltic states. Disabled pensioners remained, their share in the population structure increased dangerously, and the collapse of the pension system loomed before the Baltic in the new decade.\nNow, all the negative factors prematurely converged at one point.\nThe Baltic countries are faced with a coronavirus with an “optimized” social infrastructure, a disproportionately high proportion of the elderly among the population (and the newest infection is the hardest hit), with a quarantine-covered services sector that is almost unable to support large-scale economies and with the prospect of depriving all EU subsidies.\nThis is the collapse of the whole model of the existence of post-Soviet Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. The pain shock will be so strong that the Baltic countries may not survive it."}, {"url": "https://arabic.sputniknews.com/arab_world/202003281044999123-%D9%85%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%AF%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A8-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7/", "title": "Muqtada Al-Sadr: Legalization of same-sex marriage caused the spread of the Coronavirus", "text": "Al-Sadr said in a tweet via \"Twitter,\" \"One of the most dangerous things that caused the spread of this epidemic is legalization (gay marriage).\"\nHe added: \"From here, I call on all governments to repeal this law immediately and without delay, so it will be tantamount to remorse for guilt.

And there could not be a better example of all of America pulling for New York City than the arrival of the USNS Comfort,” the mayor added.\nIn Italy, 4,050 new cases were registered, and the country passed 100,000 total infections, it registered 800 deaths, to a total of 11,591.\nAt the same time, it would appear that infection numbers are lowering for a few days in a row, while the deaths remain relatively high, which could potentially mean that the peak of the infection in Italy is nearing, and the situation may begin recovering slowly.\nThe number of recoveries in Italy grew by 1,590, up to total 14,620. This marked the highest daily increase since the pandemic broke out in northern Italy on February 21st, according to Civil Protection Department chief Angelo Borrelli.\nIn addition to rapidly spreading in the US, Spain is the European country which appears to be far from its peak, with infected numbers rising rapidly each day – on March 30th the new registered cases were 7,846, to a total of 87,956, while the new deaths were 913, to a total of 7,716.\nChina, registered no new cases on March 30th, at all. While on March 31st, it has registered 79 new ones so far, the total sits at 81,518, with only 2,161 active ones.\nIt appears Beijing is entering the recovery phase, as Chinese President Xi Jinping said China will roll out more targeted measures to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) hit by the COVID-19 outbreak restart production and further develop.\nVarious industries and enterprises have been affected during the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, said Xi.\nA series of policies have been introduced and will be improved in tandem with the changes of the situation, said Xi, adding more targeted measures will be rolled out to help SMEs restart production and further develop.\n“We need to rise to the challenges. With the support of the Party and the government, we must stick together through thick and thin to overcome the difficulties,” Xi stressed.\nIn Russia, the active cases remained 1,836 by the end of the day on March 30th and now cases are yet reported in the early hours of March 31st.\nMoscow is on lockdown, with other areas following suit.\nNotably, the Moscow authorities created a Telegram channel for the anti-COVID-19 headquarters. What is of interest is that Telegram is officially blocked in Russia. This move itself demonstrates that Moscow authorities (and wider the neo-liberal part of elites) toss a challenge to the patriotic part of elites surrounding President Vladimir Putin. The country’s capital’s authorities are using an application, blocked by a government decision to disseminate official data.\nSince, Russia still has a relatively low number of deaths to COVID-19, below is a review of those who have succumbed to the disease, and their underlying conditions.\nThey are as follows:\n- A man of unknown age, who died in St. Petersburg, and it was discovered that he had COVID-19 due to a post-mortem test;\n- An 84-year-old woman in Moscow, who suffered diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma and cardiovascular diseases;\n- A 48-year-old-man in Vladimir region. He died on March 27th from pneumonia, he had a chronic illness and was hospitalized into the general department of the hospital in Kovrovo, it was discovered he had COVID-19 in a post-mortem test;\n- A 52-year-old man in Pskov, he had severe underlying conditions in his lungs, but also COVID-19;\n- A 90-year-old man in Moscow. He was suffering from chronic cerebral ischemia, encephalopathy and parkinsonism;\n- A 69-year-old woman in Moscow for whom there is no other information;\n- A 57-year-old man in Orenburg, who had several chronic conditions;\n- 73-year-old man in St. Petersburg, who returned from Thailand on March 1st. He suffered from several chronic conditions, including coronary heart disease and chronic heart failure, he died of acute heart failure, but had COVID-19, so he was registered as a victim of the virus;\n- 56-year-old woman in Moscow. One of her lungs had been extracted previously due to cancer, she was confirmed with a left-sided pneumonia when admitted to hospital;\n- 70-year-old woman in Moscow. She suffered from diabetes for 20 years, had terminal renal failure and other underlying conditions, she was registered as a COVID-19 victim;\n- 88-year-old man in Moscow, with several underlying conditions;\n- 73-year-old man in Moscow, also with several underlying conditions;\n- A 75 year-old male in Penza with numerous chronic diseases;\n- 3 76 – 86 years old people in Moscow. All patients had chronic diseases, in particular cardiovascular. Chronic pyelonephritis, bronchial asthma, chronic brain ischemia were also among concomitant diseases. Two of the patients suffered from diabetes.\n- A 65 years old woman in the Moscow region. She had diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and suffered a heart attack in 2019.\nFirst of all, this starts reminding strongly of the statistics of the deaths in Italy and other countries, with more men dying, and people with various (severe and mild) underlying conditions, who were exacerbated by COVID-19, or were simply above the life expectancy and with terminal conditions, but happened to have the virus.\nSeparately, a new analysis by researchers at Imperial College London, estimated that the potential impact of interventions in 11 European countries to counter the coronavirus pandemic – including school closures and national lockdowns – likely prevented up to 120,000 deaths.\nHowever, they add that the estimated proportion of people to have been infected with the virus may only be between 2 to 12% of the population (2.7% in the UK). That means, according to the analysis, between 7 and 43 million people have been infected with the coronavirus by March 28th.\nProfessor Christl Donnelly, Professor of Statistical Epidemiology within the School of Public Health, said:\n“Europeans, like many people elsewhere, have changed their lives profoundly in recent weeks. This report makes clear early evidence of the benefits of these social distancing measures. By keeping our distance from each other, we limit the opportunities for the virus to spread and reduce the risks of illness and even death among those around us.”\nProfessor Neil Ferguson, Director of J-IDEA at Imperial, added:\n“This analysis show that the interventions European countries have put in place have significantly slowed the spread of COVID-19. However, it is not yet clear whether or how quickly these measures will cause the numbers of new cases to decline. Data collected in the next two weeks will be crucial to refining our assessment of this key point.”\nGood news regarding measures aside, that means if the total infected rate doesn’t sit at above 700,00 but between 7 and 43 million (which is a gigantic margin), it would mean that the fatality rate of the disease is astronomically low.\nAnd it would also mean that the severe measures, justified or not, are a sort of large-scale “sociological experiment” which aims to see how much repression would people be willing to accept, for a vague justification, and how politicized could the entire situation be. It could potentially also show how far people can be pushed before there’s riots on the streets, and the lack of “entertainment” leads to people finding ways to “entertain” themselves. As it has been proven time and again, mob mentality dictates that “entertainment” usually means decapitating the elite.\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n- Trump: Russia Sent ‘Very, Very Large Planeload’ Of Medical Aid To Help U.S. In War On COVID-19\n- Pentagon Confirms Over 1,000 COVID-19 Cases Among Military, Orders Bases To Stop Public Reporting\n- How Did The “Three Little Piglets” Prepare For The “Wolf”: Russia, U.S., China’s Response To COVID-19\nDonate"}, {"url": "https://arabic.rt.com/press/1096064-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9/", "title": "Corona .. between treatment and plot!", "text": "Corona .. between treatment and plot!\nPress news\nThe Corona virus pandemic filled the world with loud noise and noise. Amidst the crowd of urgent precautions taken by governments and countries around the world.\nAnd against the backdrop of attempts to withstand the wave of panic, which almost invaded the citizens of many countries, and in others their uncle terror, one is eager to hear news that reassures him that this global emergency is its end, and I wish it would be close!\nBut the question is: when, and how?\nHowever, the most dangerous thing that people face these days, in addition to the danger of Corona itself, is the mystery surrounding the nature of this virus, which is actually not new as it is emerging. It has been spreading for reasons that are not entirely clear. Here Russia received its share of accusations of promoting another conspiracy theory that we will return to shortly in this article.\nHere attention is turned to scientists and specialists, who have focused on studying this epidemic, trying to find a cure. As for the desired treatment, it is either in the form of a vaccine, a vaccine, or a medical product that protects the world from the evil of more virus outbreaks, and rid humanity of it, even for a while, or that the treatment comes as a news of its near-reaching access!\nDuring the past few days, it has been reported that a group of Russian epidemiologists from the Smorodintsev Institute of Influenza Research of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences have been able to completely dismantle the corona virus genome code, so what is the significance of this discovery?\nThe \"Russian Dimensions\" program spoke to one of the Russian virologists, Professor Mikhail Kostinov, an immunologist from the Mechnikov Institute for Vaccines and Sera of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and head of a private laboratory at the Institute. He pointed out, \"It is important to know its nature, because its source is still unknown. They know the first case, but the source is not. Reading the virus's genome will allow controlling this virus and making a vaccine for it, private properties and means of protection from it, and it opens up broad horizons for a person's ability to combat This virus and its prevention. \"\nThe reasons for the explosion of the koruna erupted suddenly and did not stop it And why in China in particular? Is it the cause of periodic interactions on the map of viruses in the world that live in the globe from eternity? Or is the virus man-made and laboratory?\nDr. Kostinov explains, \"Knowing the source of the virus will be possible from its structure, as well as whether it is normal? Or by a mutation? Or as a result of an intervention of the human factor?\" Can we say that Russian scientists have already come to the truth about the origin of the Koruna, and that they can resolve the debate about who, or what drove the genie out of the bottle? Are they bats or are they human entities and entities?\nThe team of Russian scientists, with recent scientific achievements, has sent newly acquired genomic information to the EpiCoV GISAID Foundation. It is a bank for international data on viruses. Will this help activate international efforts to contain the Korean pandemic? Or will this cooperation help in making the vaccine? Or is it that the coding of the DNA code for an international organization is only for developing global virus monitoring tools?\nThe international database, Mr. Kostinov says, “is like a virus museum. Here the viruses are purposefully studied, and if they are modeled, they can be used with the aim of harm. Reading the genetic code identifies one of the methods of biological weapon control, and this allows the possibility of researching the method of control. \". Was the doctor alluding to the \"biological weapon\"?\nAs for the medical benefit of breaking down the viral DNA, the Russian Professor says: “If we know the genome, we can do more research, on how it can affect the human body. And whether that leads to a disruption in the functions of organs? \"We may be able to make a good vaccine against it specifically against this virus, and we can also study how different pharmaceuticals can affect it in order to choose what we treat and what we protect from it.\"\nIn the United States, President Donald Trump announced that they would start using the substance \"hydroxychloroquine\" as a treatment against the Covid-19 virus, which is used in the treatment of malaria and arthritis, so how effective is this medical decision? Is this the desired solution by the world's population?\nMikhail Kostinov does not rule out that \"there will be other pharmaceutical preparations under development in the laboratory, which they may use to combat this virus. Others may appear after a month or two. So now they get the virus, previously it was only in China and difficult to obtain, it was a biological material.\" Now that the virus is present in various countries, it will be studied in countries where there are pharmaceutical and research technologies, and I do not rule out that France, Italy, Germany or Russia say they have a preparation. \"\nThere is no doubt that all of humanity hopes that the nightmare of the Corona will end as soon as possible. However, Trump's position was remarkable, especially as he expressed concern that Germany or France could obtain the medicine! Did leadership considerations play here, as is the custom with the United States? Or was the team of American specialist doctors should have rushed to announce the existence of an \"American solution\" before the solution came from another country? Or are there commercial reasons linked to the competition between the major pharmaceutical companies in global markets, which generate billions of dollars?\nAs for the efforts of Russian scientists to extract a vaccine to protect humans from the new killer effectively, a number of senior Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have expressed their conviction that Russian doctors and specialists are around the corner from reaching this goal. Here we return to our question that we asked above: When is the solution?\nThe new topic, as Professor Kostinov explains, \"This vaccine is in everyone's laboratories, and the issue is that it takes 6, 8 or 10 months to implement it on the ground to understand which vaccines are best. In the laboratory work is in progress, but it must Passing first of all the experiences of the first phase, that is, the pre-clinical, where the effect of the vaccine on animals is studied, then the clinical phase comes on humans. It must be declared safe for humans. \"\nWhat baffles the country and its people is the horror that the Corona virus has provoked, and the scale of unprecedented quarantine measures taken worldwide.\nCorona is confirmed by experts to be a type of pulmonary virus from the general \"SK\". However, what is important for Corona in particular is that there is no way to compare the death rates due to it, and the death rate caused by other \"coronary\" types, and the extent of their risk to human health and life.\nIt is twice as much as the \"emerging coronary\" as in the case of the \"N5H1\" virus, for example, known as bird flu, which kills 52.8 percent of those infected, while the corona death rate does not exceed 4 percent. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that what is going on in the world of turmoil is panic!\nBut the question that everyone wants to get an answer to, is why?\nMikhail Kostinov considers that \"panic comes from all sides. First, when one takes a vaccine against influenza, he feels psychologically protected, but now nothing protects him. Secondly, the media, as if they mean it. True, the problem is there, people get sick and die.\" But it is like a mental illness, an international mental illness. The situation is excellent in countries with a strong health system. As for chaos, problems arise. The virus does not like chaos, and it will spread if there are no obstacles placed in it. As for the European Union, it does not have a pandemic surveillance system, which is different In different countries. \"\nIt is only natural that discussions will revolve around the secrets of the Corona virus. The topic has become universal. Russia is not the only one eager to know the truth, but it is one of the first to officially attain the \"testimony\" of the promoter of the theory that American biological laboratories stand behind the spread of this new epidemic in such an amazing way. But if we want to know whether this hypothesis or that is sound or wrong, then we only have to wait for more details about the findings of the Russian Influenza Research Institute, which has decoded the genome code of Corona.\nAt the same time, let us not forget that it was the Chinese who accused America of officially spreading this virus. As for Russia, a statement issued by the Embassy of the Russian Federation in London made it clear that in personal opinions any hypotheses are entitled to be expressed and not necessarily scientifically proven, as well as they have nothing to do with the official position of the Russian state.\nOther arrows pointed to Russia as \"returning and launching major disinformation campaigns\" on social media platforms and websites. But misdirection about what? The US State Department and European Union say, \"Russia wants to create a climate of mistrust in the West and undermine the credibility of European and American institutions involved in dealing with the outbreak of the Koron.\" Is this accusation surprising?\nConstantine Blokhin, the Russian expert from the Institute of Security Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, to whom the program “Russian Dimensions” spoke to, “Attracting attention from something is an easy and very comfortable step. With its direct missions… the main task is to overcome the crisis caused by the Corona virus. ”\n\"It is clear that many countries are unable to do that. And here the United States of America and Western Europe are also trying to assign responsibility to Russia at times, and to China at other times. And all of this is part of a strategy to deter Russia and China alike.\"\nThe Russian political analyst reminds that “some, and the Chinese among them, responded to this, and declared that the origin of the virus is American. Here it should be noted that the specificity of cybercrime lies in the difficulty of determining the country of origin, yet some do not shy away from accusing Russia of interfering in the state elections. United and Western Europe. \"\nIn the same context, it was noticeable the issuance of two new reports calling for Russia to conduct \"organized global campaigns to mislead the media regarding the West's treatment of the Corona disaster.\" One of them was prepared by the European Union's External Relations Department a few days ago. As for the second, it was prepared by the US State Department's Global Outreach Center in late February. The documents are confidential, the contents of which were not allowed except for the British newspaper \"Financial Times\" and the French \"Agence France Presse\". But the question is: Why were these two reports not published in full? Is it not that the more \"evidence\" is published and the more the cover is removed from \"another Russian plot\", the more Russia's reputation will be shattered?\nAre the reports, indeed, devoid of evidence? The European report points to a record of \"80 cases of Russian disinformation\" that attacked the performance of national systems for monitoring and eliminating epidemics in Europe, according to the \"Financial Times\". Likewise, the suspicions hovering - sorry, \"published by Russia\" - of the Americans' role in the Corona issue can only be considered a campaign of misleading public opinion, as is understood from the report. However, a question arises here: Why have not all the 80 cases been widely published, especially since Russia is \"trying to spread the atmosphere of terror among European societies\" and \"spreading division\" as the European Union claims? Do not such matters affect European national security in the eyes of Europeans?\nConstantine Blokhin says, “It is always possible to invent anything when facts are not available. In this case the evidence is not necessary, but it is sufficient to put a“ very secret ”stamp and refer to high-level sources. Those who practice this will keep it a secret if they have nothing to offer. The reason is the absence of evidence and facts, that is, they have nothing to say ... so simply.\nFor comparison, the number of misleading posts on Facebook accounts claimed tens of thousands of cases of corona in the Russian capital, Moscow alone, and that it exceeded 9,500 posts, according to a Russian company specializing in information security and the Russian Federal Security Service confirmed that it was published outside Russia. That was when the virus had not begun to spread widely, even in China itself.\nThe European Union then says that it is in contact with the internet and social media giants Google, Facebook and Twitter in order to \"expose Russian lies\", while Facebook and Twitter have conducted internal investigations in which no traces of attempts to arrange organized disinformation campaigns on the issue of virus spread, infections and deaths have been found.\nAs for Twitter official Yoel Root, he mentioned that his company had asked the US State Department to provide information proving Russia's involvement in organizing such campaigns, and they have not received a response yet.\nReturning to holding the United States responsible for spreading the Corona virus, Constantine Blokhin says that \"if there were facts, those examples would be brought to the fore ... I would cite one example: in America there are a huge number of Chinese neighborhoods and Chinese businessmen. In China, thousands of company representatives China is a factory for making American products and the two countries have huge economic interdependence, so it is highly unlikely that someone in the Trump administration decided to drop this virus there in an attempt to take revenge on the Chinese, because we are now seeing how financial market indicators are falling, and the joints of the global economy are cracking. , And incurred America is a huge loss. As for the elections, they have been questioned, and Trump is accused of being complacent in fighting the Corona virus. \"\nBlokhin concludes, \"It is completely stupid to think that the story of Corona is the act of Americans. There are no facts and there is no evidence ... So, the possibility that this virus is artificial or possibly of natural origin cannot be denied.\"\nAs for the report issued by the US State Department, did it bring anything new regarding the \"Russian hand\"? Here is a rare opportunity for the reader to obtain practical \"guidelines\" for dismantling the \"Russian methodology\" to organize mass media misinformation campaigns.\nFirst, the very similar \"negative\" news is published in English, Spanish, Italian, German, and French about the situation of European and American Corona, \"as the authors of the report discovered. The reader may ask: What is wrong with that, especially since significant numbers of injuries have already been recorded in European countries? Several, for example, in Italy, the injuries exceeded those of the Chinese counterparts, and in America, injuries and deaths as well? And the former West as \"Russian propaganda\".\nAnother evidence of Russia’s involvement in “spreading panic” was that the accounts publishing this “bad” news were the same ones that covered the protests of the yellow vests in France!\nFinally, the accounts and sites belonging to the Spanish section of the \"RT\" channel had obtained double numbers of views, comments and the participation of the publication (share-share) and this is what raised the interest of the authors of the report!\nBlokhin explains the matter: “The media war continues and its main characteristic is a large degree of immorality. Humanity faces a global challenge that threatens its existence, and only through cooperation can this crisis be overcome, but, instead of cooperation, a new level of media war has begun. It is clear that the policy of deterrence pursued towards Russia and China did not stop despite the crisis. \"\nOn the other hand, and as a beautiful example of concerted international efforts to confront Corona, the United Arab Emirates has made a grant to the Russian Fund for Direct Investments to employ it in research and rapid research carried out by Russian scientists in order to obtain a vaccine against the virus. Also, this fund had supported the development of modern Russian diagnostic devices that can provide the results of the analysis within a few hours in the event of a suspected \"coronary\" human infection, which is faster than those used today in the world that require several days.\nThe director of the Russian Investment Fund, Kirill Dmitriev, expressed his hope to obtain licenses soon to use the new Russian detection systems in Europe and the Middle East, and a similar request had been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration.\nMr. Dimitriev added that hospitals and medical laboratories in each of the Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Austria had confirmed the high quality of Russian diagnostic systems, and had sent requests to purchase the equivalent of five hundred thousand diagnostic systems.\nArtium Capchuk\nThe article only expresses the opinion of the newspaper or the writer\n3 million cases of corona globally ..

By the end of the year, the panic went far beyond the New York Stock Exchange. Enterprises stopped, tens and hundreds of thousands of workers quit, bankruptcies of American companies, not only small, but also giants, took place ...\nBy 1930, the economic crisis swept Europe, Latin America, Asia, became the world. The decline in production (recession) everywhere continued until 1933. America's national income from $ 87.8 billion in 1929 fell to $ 40.2 billion in 1933. More than 135 thousand trading, industrial, financial companies crashed. In the three years of the crisis, nearly half of US banks went bankrupt.\nThen the fall stopped, the phase of stagnation (stagnation) began. In different countries, the authorities made titanic efforts to pull their economies out of the swamp of stagnation. The ideas of the English economist John Keynes, who advocated active government intervention in economic life, became popular. Keynes saw the main reason for the crisis in the imbalance between the production of goods and services, on the one hand, and the limited solvent demand of the population, on the other. Before Keynes, Karl Marx wrote about the same thing in the 60s of the 19th century in Capital, who believed that this contradiction was insurmountable within the framework of the capitalist mode of production. Keynes did not think so, he proposed to compensate for the insufficient solvent demand of the population by demand from the state, using the state budget for the procurement of goods and placing orders. According to Keynes, military orders and military expenditures of the state were quite suitable for compensating for insufficient solvent demand. For the sake of increasing government spending, the English economist believed, it is possible to ensure that the state budget is in short supply, closing deficits through government borrowing and increasing sovereign debt. You can read about all this in Keynes's famous book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936).\nIn the West, they tried to use Keynes's recipes to overcome the difficult economic situation. The most consistent ideas of the English economist brought to life the US authorities. Their practical implementation began after the arrival of the Franklin Roosevelt in the White House in 1933 with its “New Deal”, which softened the socio-economic situation in the country. At the expense of state money, a public work program was carried out (road construction, land reclamation, digging canals, afforestation, other types of labor activity that did not require special qualifications of workers). This program gave employment and minimal livelihood to millions of ordinary Americans, but it still could not pull America out of a state of stagnation. The authorities could not even overcome poverty. Americans admit that during the years of crisis and depression in the United States, according to various estimates, 5-6 million people died from hunger. In Europe, stagnation also persisted; the population was in poverty.\nThe exception was only two countries - the USSR and Germany. The Soviet Union in the 1930s developed dynamically, conducting industrialization, demonstrating to the whole world the advantages of the socialist model of the economy. Germany, which initially stagnated along with other Western countries, after Hitler came to power in 1933, also began to develop dynamically; an “economic miracle” arose in the country, but it was fueled by money by American and partly English bankers, who were preparing Hitler to throw to the east against the Soviet Union.\nKeynesian methods did not create a miracle. All available at that time economic methods of revitalizing the economy were exhausted. For the West, this was especially scary against the backdrop of the high economic dynamics of the USSR — such contrasts in the economic dynamics of the Soviet Union and the capitalist countries could lead to the final victory of socialism in the world. This inevitably led the ruling circles of the West to the idea that the only way out of economic stagnation, which became chronic, could be war. Moreover, the war is large, world.\nUsing the example of World War I, the United States realized that global armed conflicts could radically change the country's economic situation. On the eve of World War I, the United States was the largest international debtor in the world (for the debts of the private sector of the economy; tsarist Russia was in first place for public debts). And at the end of the First World War, America became the largest net lender, the US dollar turned into a world currency along with the British pound.\nThe USA, England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and other leading capitalist countries began to prepare for World War II. It was believed that the war will write off all debts, the imbalances in the economy will disappear, rapid development will begin with the zeroed balance of the national economies. Debtor countries dreamed that they would win or even destroy their creditors. And creditor countries dreamed that they would get markets, debtors' natural resources and billions of reparations from the vanquished. Within the warring countries, a moratorium was imposed on the usual rules of a market economy, the state with its iron hand smoothed out the accumulated imbalances (demands and obligations), referring to wartime. War is a powerful argument for the state to restore iron order in a capitalist economy using administrative-command methods. No Keynesianism is capable of this. And World War II, which began on September 1, 1939, became a means of overcoming world capitalism from dangerously protracted stagnation.\nFast forward to the 21st century. In 2007-2009 the world is experiencing a global financial and economic crisis. This crisis did not lead to the elimination of all imbalances accumulated in the economy. After the end of the acute phase (recession) in 2009, stagnation (depression) occurred, followed by a recovery. Animations awaited a year, another, third, but expectations were not met. Today is 2020, but there is no recovery.\nCompare: in the 1930s, stagnation lasted from 1933 to 1939, six years. An agonizing lingering decay interrupted by war. Stagnation after the crisis of 2007-2009 It has been going on for 11 years. Again, excruciating decay, almost twice as protracted. In a sense, the position of the stagnating West in the 21st century is better than in the 1930s, since there is no longer the USSR with its dynamically developing economy. The Soviet rival of the West has disappeared, but there is China with its unprecedentedly high rates of economic growth. The economic dynamics of China over the past three decades can definitely be called a boom phase. Such a long upsurge was not known by any Western country in the entire history of capitalism. And the West needs to do something.\nOf course, the idea of unleashing a great war and with its help once again overcoming the damned contradictions of the capitalist mode of production came to the minds of representatives of the western ruling circles. The idea is very tempting, but at the same time deadly. After all, the first two wars did without nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The third world war will inevitably require the use of WMD. What was needed was some replacement for a world war that could help miraculously equalize the imbalances of the capitalist economy, revive it, and maintain the status quo of the ruling elite.\nAn alternative to a hot war can be the cold war, which today they prefer to call hybrid. It involves the use of financial, trade, economic, psychological, informational means, cyber weapons, special methods of special services to fight the enemy, but all this does not give the authorities the authority to move from market-based methods of economic management to administrative-command ones. And only with the help of the latter can the imbalances accumulated in the economy be overcome.\n... And then the coronavirus appeared. Authorities began to fan the threat, creating an atmosphere of fear in society. Using fear, the authorities receive unlimited powers, begin to actively intervene in the economy. Such methods are contrary to the principles of \"civilized\" capitalism, but, as they say, administrative command command will not be eternal. As soon as the imbalances in the economy are corrected, everything will return to normal: again, market management methods will return, \"civilized\" capitalism will be restored again, recovery will begin, then turning into economic growth ...\nExperts say the \"state of emergency\" regime will last until the end of the year. Maximum to the middle of the next. \"Viral war\" will be lightning fast and victorious. During this time, massive bankruptcies will pass, debts and claims on amounts measured in many trillions of dollars will be eliminated. Bubbles will blow off in the stock and other financial, as well as commodity and real estate markets. Capitalization of companies will collapse by many trillions of dollars. The economy will begin to “breathe” again, a revival will begin, which will then turn into a long-awaited growth.\nI note: the “virus war” will end not when medical statistics show a significant decrease in the number of infected and dead from the coronavirus, but when the stock and other markets hit the bottom. At this point, the owners of the money will buy up worthless assets in the bud and will enter a new level of control over the global economy. The decision to end the \"viral war\" will be made not by epidemiologists, but by the owners of the money.\nAfter that, economic growth will begin. When it ends, the economy will enter another recession, and then the ruling circles of the West will come up with some kind of virus again. And again, the play called “The fight against the pandemic” will be repeated. Such is the fundamentally new scheme of the economic cycle. It can rightly be called the viral economic cycle.\nThe owners of money who have organized the current pandemic do not need endless cyclical economic development. As well as they do not really need capitalism. They are interested in the ultimate goal - power over the world. They dream of establishing a new world order, where there will be no nation-states, where a world government will be established. This order will no longer have anything to do with classical capitalism. It can be called the new slave system or the new feudalism.\nThe outbreak of the viral war revealed the plans of the world elite, illuminated its agents, revealed many secrets of its subversive activities. A pandemic will make millions of people in the world think about what they had not thought about before, believing that the project of a new world order is the fantasies of a handful of conspiracy theorists. The result will be (is already becoming) the willingness of millions of people around the world to fight. No, not with coronavirus, let doctors and other professionals deal with it, but with the owners of the money.\nPhoto: pixabay.com"}, {"url": "https://arabic.rt.com/russia/1079793-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B4%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7/", "title": "Russian politician: the United States behind the outbreak of \"Corona\" virus!", "text": "Russian politician: the United States behind the outbreak of \"Corona\" virus!\nRussia news\nThe leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, accused the United States of being behind the spread of the new \"Corona\" virus worldwide.\nDuring a meeting with students and professors at the Institute of World Civilizations in Moscow today, Saturday, Zhirinovsky said that the new virus is spreading at a tremendous speed, from one continent to another.\n\"Is it really a new type of influenza?

Until now, any books or other publications are unknown to her. Maybe he keeps his golden thoughts to himself ...\n- But she was the Polish minister of foreign affairs?\n- Yes, for one year, in one of the first two PiS governments.\nAt that time I was a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and I remember perfectly well how this terrified woman, after reading from a piece of information prepared by her colleagues, escaped from our meetings so that by chance we could not ask her any questions.\nI also remember the stories of diplomats with extensive experience in foreign service who, before entering her office, had to ask secretaries about the boss's humor and whether she had already caused a row or whether there was any sense to go to her.\nIf someone had necessarily got to her, she would receive him standing up, not even politely suggesting that he sit down and drink tea. Such a syndrome of low power, with a panic fear of an incomprehensible, complicated external world.\nIt has already gone to the legends that Anna Fotyga hid and put off all matters, such a minister \"in an hour\".\n- And how can one evaluate her political career?\n- Marek Suski is an emblematic figure for PiS. Let's say Anna Fotyga is Marek Suski in a skirt.\nIt's just that she was more lucky, because she was once stubbornly promoted by Lech Kaczyński, who was elected to the EP for several terms, which - of course - protects her material existence for the rest of her life. In all these years, she broadcast party messages from Nowogrodzka in a very primitive, sometimes vulgar way.\nOne could get the impression that it was some kind of amok, a total eclipse, especially when she began to tell the tale of the assassination of the president in the style of Macierewicz, to somehow duplicate conspiracy theories quite awkwardly. It is probably then that prof. Tomasz Nałęcz could not stand and said that such people \"need to be treated\". I'm not surprised. That was the impression he had.\n- Maybe Anna Fotyga has gained some experience in the European Parliament?\n- I haven't heard very much about her initiatives.\nNo, I'm sorry, she agitated several times for various types of resolutions aimed at Russia, she juxtaposed the alleged Russian threat with the threat of the so-called Islamic State and the like.\nI also don't think her condition and intellectual condition have improved, there is no indication.\n- Why did Anna Fotyga find herself in the group of NATO sages?\n- In fact, whoever did not sit there, the effect of the work of such a group will be rather poor. NATO has completely exhausted its raison d'etre.\nWhether Anna Fotyga will sit there or anyone else is therefore of no strategic importance. It is, however, some image problem there, because I do not think that it could enter into any discussions with the other members of the group and it will consolidate the opinion about Poland as a country without staff, capable of any intellectual effort.\nProbably, however, PiS simply has no better human resources and will not have any more. I remember when in PiS they changed Paweł Kowal as a person responsible for foreign policy, with whom I completely disagree, but who has considerable knowledge, precisely for Fotyga. And such Fotygi, such Suscy is the face of today's PiS elite.\nThe views and opinions contained in the article may be inconsistent with the editorial position."}, {"url": "https://www.turkeytodey.com/international/2384/", "title": "Study: \"Corona\" is not considered fatal to all humans and these people are most susceptible to infection", "text": "Study: \"Corona\" is not considered fatal to all humans and these people are the most susceptible to infection\nScientific studies have shown that there are some incorrect concepts about the Corona virus, which is that it is not considered the fastest spread.

Perhaps that event will be the coronavirus epidemic.\nIt is too early to draw firm conclusions, but some geopolitical and ideological factors may have already passed the point of no return.\nThe coronavirus epidemic represents the end of globalization. The open society is ripe for infection. Those who want to break down borders prepare the ground for the total annihilation of humanity. You can smile, of course, but people in white HazMat suits will take care of putting an end to inappropriate laughter soon. Only closure can save us. Closure in all senses - closed borders, closed economies, closed supply of goods and products, what Fichte has called a \"closed commercial state\". Soros should be lynched, while a monument should be built in honor of Fichte. This is the first lesson.\nSecond: the coronavirus opens the last page of the history of liberalism. Liberalism has made it easier for the virus to spread - in all senses. The epidemic requires the demolition of all differences. Liberalism is the virus. A little more time will pass, and the liberals will be equated to the \"lepers\", infectious \"maniacs\" who invite you to dance and have fun in the midst of a plague. The liberal is the bearer of the coronavirus, its apologist. Especially if it turns out that it was created in the United States, the \"citadel of liberalism\" as a biological weapon. So this is lesson number two: liberalism kills.\nThird: the criteria for the success and prosperity of countries and societies are radically changing. In the fight against the epidemic, neither China's wealth nor the European social system, nor the absence of a social system in the United States (which by contrast hold the greatest military and financial power in the world) will save them. The Iranian spiritual and vertical regime is also not very helpful. The coronavirus has completely blocked what constitutes the pinnacle of modern civilization - oil, finance, free trade, the market, total domination of the Fed ... world leaders are impotent. Completely different criteria have come to the fore:\n- possession of an antivirus;\n- the ability to be able to independently support life for themselves and their loved ones in conditions of maximum closure.\nMeeting these criteria means reconsidering all values. The vaccine is found near those who in all likelihood developed the virus, and is therefore an unreliable solution. However, closure and the transition to self-sufficiency is something everyone can do, although this necessarily requires a multipolar arrangement. Small farms and natural exchanges will survive the general collapse of everything.\nSo what would be the next logical steps to take after the triumphant march of the coronavirus on the whole planet? At best, the appearance of several relatively closed areas of the world - civilizations, large spaces - or, at worst, the worlds of Mad Max and Resident Evil. The Russian series \"The Epidemic\" is becoming reality before our eyes.\nThe pestilential gods\nI begin to understand why in some societies the pestilential gods were revered and worshiped. The advent of the plague allows a complete renewal of societies. The epidemic has no logic and does not spare the nobles, the rich or the powerful. It destroys everyone indiscriminately and brings people back to the simple fact of their being. The gods of the plague are the most righteous. Antonin Artaud wrote about it, comparing the theater to the plague. The purpose of the theater, according to Artaud, is, with all the cruelty possible, to return man to the fact that he is, who is here and now, a fact that man tries to constantly forget with perseverance. Plague is an existential phenomenon. The Greeks called Apollo \"Smintheus\", the \"Mouse God\", and attributed to his arrows the power to carry the plague. This is where the Iliad begins, as everyone knows.\nThis is what Apollo would do if he observed modern humanity - bankers, bloggers, rappers, deputies, employees, migrants, feminists ... there is not much else.\nBuñuel directed a film called \"The Exterminating Angel\" which speaks more or less about this.\nHow the world ends\nThe elements of the epidemic that seem to suggest that it was created by man should also be recorded, to allow the West to use the virus against its own geopolitical opponents (which explains China and Iran, but not Italy and the rest) or even to start a targeted extermination of all those billions of people in excess by a small circle of humanity equipped with a vaccine that was in turn produced by \"progress\" and \"open society\" . In this case, the \"pestilential gods\" could prove to be very specific representatives of the global financial elite, which has long recognized the \"limits of growth\". But even in this case - especially if this is not the beginning of a real global genocide, but only a trial test - the conclusion is the same: those who pretend to be responsible agents in relation to human societies are not what they seem.\nLiberalism is only a pretext for mass extermination, as were colonization and the spread of the standards of modern Western civilization. Global elites and their local puppets can count on survival by means of a vaccine, but something suggests that this could be where the lies come to the surface. The virus can behave in an unexpected way, and the processes initiated at a civilization level, and even in individual unpredictable spontaneous events, can upset their carefully studied plans.\nThe whole world economy may not collapse in a few months, but everything seems to go exactly in this direction ...\nWhat modern man considers \"sustainable\" and \"reliable\" is pure illusion, the coronavirus is demonstrating this clearly and clearly. In fact, once the logic of what is happening has developed further, we could see how the world ends - at least the world we know and knew. And, at the same time, the first contours of something else will begin to appear.\nMatter at risk\nIt is curious that, in parallel with the coronavirus, which has become, in a certain sense, the central theme of civilization, discussions have arisen in the scientific community on the \"bubbles of nothingness\", reviving some hypotheses of the famous physicist Edward Witten, one of the main theorists the phenomena of \"superstrings\".\nAccording to the ideas of modern physicists, the \"bubbles of nothing\" can arise from a \"false vacuum\", that is, from a vacuum that has not reached stability, but seems to have reached it only apparently. In the decimal world (with 4 ordinary measures and 6 others, present by compactification) such \"bubbles of nothingness\" are quite probable. If they arise, they can suck galaxies into nothing and swallow the Universe. These vortices generated by an unstable vacuum make a certain impression.\nAnd again, as in the case of the coronavirus, it is said that \"nothing bad is happening, everything is under control\". The representatives of the scientific elite reassure us that the possibility of the appearance of the \"bubbles of nothing\" is ridiculously small.\nHowever, in my opinion, it is not at all. On the contrary, it is quite significant. The modern world represents exactly such a rapidly growing \"bubble of nothingness\", assimilating meanings and dissolving existence: liberalism and globalization are its most vivid expressions. Coronavirus is also a bubble of nowhere.\nThe very nature of this virus is interesting (even if I hate the concept of \"nature\", there is nothing more senseless). It is something between a living being - it has DNA or RNA - and a mineral (it has no cells). But above all, it reminds us of a neural network or even an artificial intelligence. It is both there and elsewhere, both living and inanimate ... this is precisely the \"void out of balance\", which creates these \"bubbles of nothingness\".\nWe believe that the void of the universe is in equilibrium, that is, that the entire cycle of possible entropy has passed ... but if it were only apparently?\nWhen you hear the history of the Wuhan market and imagine the struggle of bats with poisonous snakes, their fierce contagious exchange and the microscopic killer arrows of the crown-shaped non-existence, it is impossible to get rid of the image of the bubbles of nothing . The same feeling is caused by the drop in oil prices and the collapse of stock indices. Even war - with its specificity and its existential awakening - does not save us from the attack of nothing, being the motivation of modern wars so deeply entangled in material, financial and corrupt interests, having lost its original purity: the encounter headed for death. It acts only as a further bubble of nothing, fulfilling its directives to lead matter to total oblivion.\nThe plague as an event\nIt is possible to expect that humanity, after facing the coronavirus, will draw the necessary conclusions, curb globalization, abandon liberal superstitions, stop migrations and put an end to the obscene technical inventions that are plunging everyone deeper and deeper into infinite mazes of matter ? The answer is clearly negative. Everyone will quickly return to their old habits in the blink of an eye, even before the corpses are buried. As soon as - and if - the markets come to life and the Dow Jones wakes up, everything will return to normal. The naive is the one who thinks differently. What does this mean? It means that even an epidemic of this magnitude will turn into an unfortunate misunderstanding.
