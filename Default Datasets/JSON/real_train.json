Hundreds of thousands of displaced people are crowded into camps, with limited access to soap and water, and no way of practising social distancing.\nThe message from al-Shabab only adds to the government's concerns, especially as it could oppose medical help from international aid agencies just as it resisted most food aid during the 2010-2012 famine, when more than 250,000 people were estimated to have died.\n12.3 millionpopulation\n6.3 millionat risk of hunger\n3.1 millionneed health assistance\n2.7 millionneed water and sanitation support\n2.6 millionhomeless because of instability\nSomalia's mainstream Muslim clerics have now decided to fight back.\nKoranic schools - known as madrassas, which nearly every child in Somalia attends - have been closed to help stop the spread of the virus.\nThe ministries of religious affairs, health and information have been working with Muslim leaders to transform teachers and mosque Imams into what has been dubbed as an \"anti-corona army\".\n\"They will stand with loudspeakers at every crossroads, every gathering place, to spread the word on how to prevent the spread of Covid-19,\" says Koshin Abdi Hashi, deputy co-ordinator for the prevention and countering of violent extremism in the office of the prime minister.\n\"They will drive around in vehicles mounted with loudspeakers, and transmit messages from the minarets of mosques,\" he adds.\nMohamed Ali Ibrahim, a university professor and senior adviser in the ministry of religious affairs, says the messages will include religious elements.\n\"We will talk about hand-washing and social distancing, but also speak of how Islam encourages cleanliness, including ablutions before prayers, and how there were dangerous diseases at the time of the Prophet Muhammad.\"\nIslamic teachings on hygiene:\n- Cleanliness is half of faith\n- Wash hands before and after eating\n- Wash hands after going to the toilet\n- Wash hands, face and feet before each of the five daily prayers\n- Bathe before main weekly prayer on Fridays\n- Wash a person after death; some clerics say it is fine if this cannot be done in current circumstances\nThe \"anti-corona army\" will monitor people, making sure they wash their hands thoroughly and regularly with soap and water, and maintain a safe distance from one another.\nGiven that so many Somalis live in overcrowded camps and other dwellings, this will not always be possible.\nHand-washing facilities have been set up in some of the camps, but as Mr Hashi says: \"Social distancing is an abstract issue.\"\nSome believe Covid-19 is a divine punishment imposed on China for its treatment of the Muslim Uighurs\"\nOsman Aden Dubow, deputy minister of religious affairs, says: \"We have to use the sheikhs [religious leaders] and koranic teachers to fight this disease as they are the most respected community in Somalia.\n\"People trust them more than anybody else and will not only listen to what they say but follow their instructions.\"\nHowever, the religious community is going to have a hard time combating some of the coronavirus myths taking hold in Somalia.\nSome believe Covid-19 is a divine punishment imposed on China for its treatment of the Muslim Uighurs.\nNow that it has taken hold in the US, some say Americans are being punished because they oppress Muslims. Others simply believe that if one is a good Muslim, one cannot catch the disease.\nMore on Africa and the virus:\n- Live tracker: Coronavirus in Africa\n- Zimbabwean broadcaster died 'alone and scared'\n- The Ethiopian leading the fight against the coronavirus\n- Ghana mourns mass funeral ban\n- The fake coronavirus stories spreading in Africa\nSomalia's most senior sheikh, Ali Dheere, is adamant that the involvement of the religious community will help bust myths and encourage Somalis to do the right thing.\nHe says that, even though most Somalis are observant Muslims, they will understand that life cannot continue as usual.\nThey have been encouraged to pray at home and either not attend burials or to maintain social distance during the funeral service.\n\"In Islam, anything that causes harm is not permissible. Prayers have even been suspended at the holy mosques in Mecca and Medina,\" Sheikh Dheere notes.\n\"If a person dies from coronavirus and it is not safe to wash the body, our religion allows someone to be buried without being washed,\" he adds.\nCeasefire plea\nThere are fears that al-Shabab will try to exploit some of the religious leaders' initiatives for their own advantage.\nFor example, they could attack the decision to close koranic schools or adapt religious practices.\nThey could step up their campaign to blame \"infidel\" foreign lands for bringing the virus to Somalia, as those initially infected with Covid-19 came from abroad.\nHowever, some believe al-Shabab might lose support if coronavirus takes hold in the regions it controls, as it has even more basic health facilities than those in many government-controlled areas.\nUN Secretary General António Guterres has called for a \"global ceasefire\" in the face of the pandemic.\nThe warring parties in Yemen have agreed to stop fighting; separatists in mainly English-speaking Cameroon have declared a temporary ceasefire.\nBut diplomats doubt that al-Shabab will lay down its arms, as the group has continued to carry out attacks since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus a global pandemic.\nBut there is hope that the outbreak could open the door to negotiations, in order to prevent mass deaths.\nLow-level discussions have previously taken place during humanitarian crises to enable the delivery of some food aid and other assistance.\nOptimists believe similar talks to help contain the spread of the virus could take place, and develop into more substantial negotiations, perhaps eventually leading to compromise and an end to the long years of conflict.\n- A SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?\n- AVOIDING CONTACT: The rules on self-isolation and exercise\n- LOOK-UP TOOL: Check cases in your area\n- MAPS AND CHARTS: Visual guide to the outbreak\n- VIDEO: The 20-second hand wash\n- STRESS: How to look after your mental health"}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/business/engineer-fears-china-virus-impact-cv32x0t3s", "title": "Engineer fears China virus impact", "text": "Engineer fears China virus impact\nA British engineering group that specialises in performance measurement has reported a slowdown in Chinese activity as the coronavirus crisis continues to hamper industrial production and demand.\nSpectris said it had been “experiencing less activity” in China, where it has two manufacturing sites and generates just over tenth of its sales.\nAndrew Heath, chief executive, said he expected markets to “remain challenging” in the first half of 2020 even without a “material impact” from Covid-19. “We expect limited top-line growth,” he told investors.\nThe FTSE 250 business, which dates back more than a century, started as a manufacturer of seaplanes and became a producer of high quality instruments for use in laboratories and on production lines.

Putin postponed a public vote for the constitutional amendments, originally scheduled for last Wednesday, and declared a “non-working” period after Russia saw a sharp spike in Covid-19 infections.\nHere are the key takeaways from Proekt’s investigation:\nKiriyenko kickstart\n— Sergei Kiriyenko, Putin’s first deputy chief of staff who’s in charge of the constitutional reforms vote, tested positive for Covid-19 in mid-April, Proekt said. Kiriyenko reportedly recovered in three days and his second and third tests were negative.\n— Before that, the presidential administration’s domestic policy bloc, which is responsible for elections and voting, had actively opposed introducing quarantine measures that would disrupt its fully formed plan for the April 22 vote.\n— A “panicked” mayor’s office in Moscow, the epicenter of Russia’s Covid-19 outbreak, served as another key factor that ultimately led Putin to postpone the vote. It will now either be held in June or sometime this fall.\n— Everyone in the presidential administration’s domestic policy bloc now gets tested for Covid-19 at least once a week. At the cabinet level, only those who directly contact Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin get tested for Covid-19. The other staffers are required to wear face masks.\nPR for Putin\n— The Kremlin reportedly watched with irritation as social media users and opposition activists speculated about Putin’s alleged self-isolation during the outbreak in mid-March.\n— With Putin’s public approval ratings dipping during his four-day stay in Crimea as Western leaders actively communicated with their populations regarding the pandemic, a federal official recalled that “we need to do something too.” In the ensuing days, Putin visited Russia’s top coronavirus hospital in Moscow and declared a nationwide paid “non-working” period.\n— Putin’s public address led to a bump in the polls. Thereafter, the Kremlin reportedly developed a strategy to maintain the public’s loyalty toward the authorities. It included Putin regularly addressing the public and daily news reports showing him discussing efforts to fight the Covid-19 outbreak with officials.\n— The good-PR strategy extended to ordering Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to cede his scheduled remarks announcing support measures for citizens and businesses to Putin in mid-April.\n— “It’s important to come out of this so that the people would understand that nothing would have happened without the leader,” an unnamed federal official was quoted as saying.\nOvershadowing Sobyanin\n— Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin’s skyrocketing visibility amid the outbreak, which was reflected in public trustworthiness ratings, irked both Mishustin and the Kremlin. Putin’s public approval ratings, meanwhile, slightly dipped amid talk of his absence.\n— Officials and state-backed journalists now present Sobyanin’s actions as “the advancement of presidential instructions” as part of the Kremlin’s strategy to ensure good PR for Putin.\nRegional loyalty\n— Kiriyenko’s domestic policy bloc apparently distributed guidelines to regional authorities on boosting voter loyalty at the height of the Covid-19 outbreak. These included blocking negative news online, attracting elderly voters through online classes, recruiting volunteers and organizing online challenges and flash mobs.\n— While some regions attempted to act on some of the ideas, others froze preparations for the vote on Putin’s constitutional reforms, citing their focus on dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak."}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/doctors_urge_flu_shots_before_epidemic_peaks/11203467", "title": "Doctors urge flu shots before epidemic peaks", "text": "Doctors urge flu shots before epidemic peaks\nInfluenza season is expected to peak in March in the Uusimaa region, which includes Helsinki.\nThis winter's influenza season will become more active over the next few weeks, predicts Eeva Ruotsalainen, deputy chief physician of the infectious diseases division of Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH, also known as HUS).\n\"So far 19 people have been in intensive care or monitoring in the HUCH region.

Unfortunately, these tend to under-count the true number of fatalities that the disease has already caused. In many places, official daily figures exclude anybody who did not die in hospital or who did not test positive. Often the cause of death takes several days to establish and report, which creates a lag in the data. And even the most complete covid-19 records will not count people who were killed by conditions that might normally have been treated, had hospitals not been overwhelmed by a surge of patients needing intensive care.\n[Jump to Lombardy, Spain, France, England and Wales, Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Austria, New York City, Jakarta or Istanbul]\nA better way to measure the damage caused by such a medical crisis is to look at “excess mortality”: the gap between the total number of people who died from any cause, and the historical average for the same place and time of year. The charts below use data from EuroMOMO, a network of epidemiologists who collect weekly reports on deaths from all causes in 24 European countries, covering 350m people.\nCompared to the baseline average of deaths from 2009-19, the flu seasons of 2017, 2018 and 2019 were all unusually lethal. But the covid-19 pandemic, which arrived much later in the year, has already reached a higher peak—and would have been far more damaging without social-distancing measures. EuroMOMO’s figures suggest that there were about 120,000 excess deaths between March 16th and April 19th.\nWe cannot compare EuroMOMO’s reports directly to official covid-19 tolls, because the organisation does not publish absolute numbers of deaths for each country. Instead, we have gathered data separately from statistical bureaus around the world (see table below). Some Western nations began releasing regular updates in early April, as we first reported at the time. A few—such as Italy and the Netherlands—show an excess of deaths that is double the official covid-19 tally for the same period.\nThat discrepancy will surely be greater in poorer countries, which have less capacity for testing and treating patients. For example, data about burials in Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, suggest that the official covid-19 figures in March might have captured only 5% of the true toll. As more places start to publish their total mortality figures, The Economist will report and analyse them on this page.\nItaly was the first European country to be overrun by the virus. On April 27th its official count of covid-19 deaths was nearly 27,000. Yet the true toll is much higher. Giorgio Gori, the mayor of Bergamo, a northern town hit especially hard, has said that the daily data are “the tip of the iceberg…too many victims are not included in the reports because they die at home.” The official covid-19 tally, published by the ministry of health, includes only people who tested positive before passing away.\nSo far, Italy’s national statistical bureau has published figures of deaths from all causes for only 1,700 of the country’s 7,900 municipalities, covering the period until April 4th. We have analysed a sample of these areas, including Bergamo, which contain 7.2m of the 10m residents in Lombardy, the worst-affected region. Between March 1st (the week Lombardy passed 50 official fatalities) and April 4th, this sample suffered about 6,100 official covid-19 deaths, according to our estimate. In the same period, it registered 12,800 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 48% of the true estimated excess.\nSpain has experienced a similar outbreak, with its official death toll nearing 24,000 on April 27th, according to data from hospitals. Like Italy, the country’s overall mortality data imply that the actual number is higher, although the extent of the undercounting is less severe.\nSpain’s national epidemiology centre is publishing figures for deaths from all causes. Between March 11th (the week Spain passed 50 official fatalities) and April 14th, the country recorded 18,000 official covid-19 deaths. In the same period it registered 26,800 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 67% of the estimated excess.\nFrance’s official death toll accelerated rapidly in April, after its central health authority began including people who died in nursing and care homes. By April 27th, nearly 40% of the 23,000 recorded national fatalities came from such institutions. Our chart for the whole of France includes these extra numbers. But our charts for individual regions do not, because the care-home data have not yet been broken down geographically.\nFrance’s national statistical bureau has published figures for deaths from all causes up to April 13th. Between March 10th (the week France passed 50 official fatalities) and April 13th, the country recorded 14,900 official covid-19 deaths, including those from care homes. In the same period it registered 17,400 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 86% of the estimated excess.\nBritain’s daily covid-19 toll, which is published by the health ministry and based on submissions from hospitals, reached 21,000 on April 27th. However, the national statistical bureau has produced an expanded covid-19 estimate after analysing the probable causes mentioned on death certificates up to April 17th. These revised numbers are shown in our charts.\nBetween March 14th (the week England and Wales passed 50 official fatalities) and April 17th, the region recorded 19,100 official covid-19 deaths, according to the revised estimate. In the same period it registered 27,000 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 71% of the estimated excess.\nThe official covid-19 death toll in the Netherlands stood at 4,500 on April 27th. However, the national institute for public health, which publishes the daily figures, includes only people who have tested positive for the virus (often with a delay).\nThe Dutch national statistical bureau has published figures for deaths from all causes up to April 19th. Between March 16th (the week the Netherlands passed 50 official fatalities) and April 19th, the country recorded 3,700 official covid-19 deaths. In the same period it registered 7,600 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 48% of the estimated excess.\nSweden’s approach to fighting the virus has received much attention, as it is one of the few Western countries that has not enforced a widespread lockdown. On April 27th its official covid-19 death toll was just 2,300, counting only people who had tested positive before passing away.\nThe Swedish national statistical bureau is publishing regular figures for deaths from all causes. Between March 25th (the week Sweden passed 50 official fatalities) and April 7th the country recorded 1,500 official covid-19 deaths. In the same period it registered 1,700 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 90% of the estimated excess.\nAfter adjusting for population, Belgium has one of the highest official covid-19 death tolls in the world. On April 27th it stood at 7,200. The country’s health experts have pointed out that this high number includes victims who had coronavirus-like symptoms but did not test positive (many of whom died outside of hospitals). The official covid-19 figures have also been retrospectively adjusted to list deaths on the day they happened, rather than the day they were eventually reported.\nThe Belgian national health institute has also released figures for deaths from all causes, up to April 12th. Between March 16th (the week Belgium passed 50 official fatalities) and April 12th the country recorded 4,500 official covid-19 deaths. In the same period it registered 4,900 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 93% of the estimated excess.\nLike neighbouring Germany (which has yet to release recent total mortality data), Austria locked down early and has suffered relatively few deaths from the virus. On April 27th its official covid-19 death toll was less than 600, counting only people who had tested positive before passing away.\nThe Austrian national statistical bureau has released figures for deaths from all causes, up to April 5th. Between March 23rd (the week Austria passed 50 official fatalities) and April 5th the country recorded 188 official covid-19 deaths. In the same period it registered 330 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 57% of the estimated excess.\nAfter trailing behind the death tolls of many European countries at first, America’s official death count has risen sharply. By April 27th it had recorded nearly 55,000 victims, more than any other country. Though most American states do not publish recent records of deaths from all causes, the city of New York, the worst-affected area, has provided weekly data up to April 11th.\nNew York’s health department has also adopted a similar approach to Britain’s statisticians, by expanding its definition of covid-19 fatalities and analysing death certificates retrospectively. As of April 27th, it has found an additional 5,200 people who had “probably” died of the virus, along with the 11,700 victims who had tested positive at that point. We have included these revised figures in our chart.\nBetween March 15th (the week New York passed 50 official fatalities) and April 11th, the city recorded 10,300 official covid-19 deaths, according to the revised estimate. In the same period it registered 11,000 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers, after including “probable” covid-19 fatalities, account for nearly all the excess deaths.\nIndonesia is one of the first developing countries to have released data about excess mortality—not an official count of deaths from all causes, but instead a tally of burials from Jakarta's department of parks and cemeteries. Typically, the department records about 2,800 burials a month (accounting for roughly 75% of all people who die in the city). But in March, the department reported 4,400 burials, suggesting an excess of at least 1,600 fatalities.\nAlthough Jakarta has been the epicentre of the covid-19 outbreak in Indonesia, at the end of March its official death toll was just 84, barely 5% as high as the excess burials. Even on April 19th, the city’s official tally of dead was still only 290. This suggests that the country is drastically under-counting the severity of the outbreak.\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, insists that his government has taken every precaution to fight covid-19, despite not imposing a full lockdown. On April 27th the country’s official death toll stood at 2,900. The last time the government produced a regional breakdown of the figures, on April 1st, Istanbul had roughly 40% of the nation’s deaths and 55% of confirmed cases.\nHowever, data about burials from the city’s government suggest that between March 22nd and April 25th Istanbul suffered at least 3,100 excess deaths, when compared to the same period in previous years.

Each day, Foreman receives updates from his vendors in China, where about 85% of products for the $80bn global toy industry sources are located. And each day, supply chain problems related to the global outbreak of Covid-19 mount.\nAt this time of year about 400 million Chinese workers should be returning to factories after the lunar new year, but this year there’s no sense that even if they do, Chinese vendors will have materials or transportation to restart production.\n“There’s challenges with truckers getting through provinces to the ports, there are too many containers and not enough boats, or too few containers and not enough boats. There’s upheaval and uncertainty, and everyone is on pins and needles until we understand the significance of this.”\nFor the time being, US toy consumers – children – have little to fear. This is a slow period for the industry, and stocks are plentiful. But come May, when summer demand picks up, or into the holiday season, when it peaks, the story could be very different.\nWith toy manufacturing centered in China, opportunities to reconfigure global supply rapidly are limited, said Steve Pasierb of the New York-based Toy Association. “The story is changing day to day but fortunately we’ve still got another 40 to 60 days before it becomes a crisis.”\nJessica Alcalde, a product sourcing consultant in New York, echoed that sentiment. “If it keeps going on through July and August it will become a serious concern for a lot of people.”\nAccording to Foreman, Chinese vendors may be open for business but production lines aren’t necessary running. Many factory owners, he said, report that their workers will need to be quarantined before starting work, but it’s unclear where that quarantine is taking place except in what Chinese authorities describe as “special places”.\nWith 100 employees in the US, 85 in Hong Kong and 10 in China, Basic Fun will have little choice but to trim expenses and jobs if the supplies dry up. Nor can the company simply pivot to other toy-producing nations, since most get their components from China.\n“If we can’t get product, we’re going to be upside down, and if we’re upside down, there’s only one way to stabilize the balance sheet and that’s by cutting costs,” Foreman said. “We’re in uncharted territory, that’s for sure.”\nThis story is being told across industries, with every type of consumer product, from bridal dresses to mobile phones, cars and luxury products to pharmaceuticals, looking at potentially severe disruption over the coming months.\nA trickle of warnings about supply chain issues earlier this month has become a cascade of alerts. Almost no globally integrated industry appears immune, triggering US stock indices to register their worst US weekly drop since the 2008 financial crisis, down about 12%.\nIt’s too early to predict the full impact of the crisis on the US economy. The rout in stock markets suggests it could be serious but could just as easily evaporate if the Covid-19 outbreak wanes. But already Federal Reserve officials are signaling they are open to an interest rate cut if the outbreak worsens.\nAnd global supply line interruptions, like those experienced by Basic Fun, are one of the clearest indicators of economic damage.\n“Every single leg of the supply chain has exposure to disruption,” said Richard Wilding OBE, professor of supply chain strategy at Cranfield University. The disruption, Wilding said, is governed by unintended consequences. “With Italy, for example, they stopped trains going into Austria. As soon as that happens, you’ve got to ask if freight is also stopping.”\nEven if production in China is restored, transportation may remain seized. Shipping containers are stacking up in Chinese ports, leading to shortages in other parts of the globe.\nMore tonnage of container ships is idled now than during the global financial crisis, according to Alphaliner, a shipping data service. Charter rates for tankers and bulk freighters have plummeted more than 70% since early January, according to Hong Kong-based Mandarin Shipping.\nThe knock-on to industry is already apparent. Credit agency Moody’s predicted global auto sales volume could drop 2.5% year-over-year, with Chinese sales sinking 2.9%. On Wednesday, Microsoft shares fell 2% after the company said it doesn’t expect to meet the quarterly revenue guidance.\nApple, with nearly 290 of 800 Chinese component suppliers centered in Wuhan, has said it does not expect to reach its own quarterly revenue guidance as a result of impact from Covid-19.\nThe luxury goods industry, affected by virus outbreaks in northern Italian production centers and by a sharp drop in Chinese consumer spending that accounts for 30% of global sales, could be more severe.\nGlobal luxury manufacturers have taken a $25.5bn stock hit, with sector leader LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton accounting for over half of that decline, as dozens of other industry leaders have issued missed earnings warnings.\nFor the time being, the resilience of supply, production and transportation systems remains key to mitigating economic damage.\nStill, interruptions to global supply chains are often not easily or quickly countered.\nAmerican Axle & Manufacturing, an auto parts maker based in Detroit, has said it expects about $25m in lost sales during February and early March as car manufacturing slumps in China. Tesla, which recently opened a Shanghai factory to build models for Chinese customers, said last month it expected the disruptions to “slightly impact” profitability.\nWith nearly 1,600 cases of Covid-19 reported in South Korea, and community transmission outbreaks reported in Germany and the US, supply chain issues may intensify, said Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS. Businesses discounting potential disruptions because of the yearly disruption of lunar new year “are awakening to the fact that there will be delays from China but also new areas”.\nA recent report from Fung Business Intelligence worried that nations newly affected by the virus might not be able to deal with a coronavirus outbreak as efficiently as China, where the rate of new infections appears to be dropping.\n“For a number of reasons, be it political or economic, these countries might not be able or willing to take containment measures as stringent as China, which could doom their efforts to contain the Covid,” the report said.\n“The Covid-19 is no longer a China issue or an Asian issue, but a global issue,” it added."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance", "title": "Coronavirus latest : at a glance", "text": "Coronavirus 6 May: at a glance\nA summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak\n- Follow our latest coronavirus blog for live news and updates\nKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:\nGlobal confirmed cases exceed 3.65 million\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins University say at least 3,656,644 people have been infected since the outbreak began, while at least 256,736 are known to have died.

But Not Like This . ", "text": "HAMBURG, Germany — Spider-Man, that force for good, taught us that with great power comes great responsibility. That’s especially true in times of strife. So in the midst of arguably Europe’s worst crisis since 1945, is Germany — the continent’s powerhouse — living up to its great responsibility?\nThis week may tell us. On Thursday, the heads of the European Union’s governments are meeting to discuss the introduction of so-called corona bonds, which would distribute countries’ debt across the continent. Several southern European states insist such bonds are essential to help fund the reconstruction of their economies, after the ravages of the coronavirus. But Germany, the Netherlands and other northern countries are strictly against the policy. It is bound to be a historic showdown.\nThe introduction of corona bonds might be a strong symbol of cohesion — but the joy will be short lived. They will in time cause damage from which Europe might not be able to recover. In the interests of the long-term well-being of Europe, it’s Germany’s great responsibility to resist them.\nIt’s entirely understandable that Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy has called for a rescue package of at least 1.5 trillion euros, around $1.63 trillion — and that he sees no other ways of creating the cash flow than by issuing collective bonds. But Mr. Conte should consider two things. First, this is not the euro crisis, with its starkly uneven effects: The coronavirus has hit the economies of Germany and other European countries in much the same way as it has Italy’s. Second, Germany and others are absolutely willing to help. But this readiness does not stretch to scrapping a fundamental principle of the eurozone — that the union shall not be liable for the commitments of single governments.\nTo cross this red line would do more harm than good. Corona bonds would breach a founding principle of the eurozone, a core promise that helped convince the Germans of the idea of the euro in the first place: Every country is responsible for its own budget and no one will be allowed to live at the expense of others. Even if intended to be temporary, corona bonds would be viewed as an opening of the floodgates. They would not only reawaken anti-European populist parties like the Alternative for Germany, whose support has been falling. By showing how malleable the rules can be, they would also spread euroscepticism far into the political center.\nSure, not granting the bonds is feeding populists in the south — like Italy’s opposition leader Matteo Salvini. The rescue package of 500 billion euros, around $540 billion, agreed to by E.U. governments this month, inflamed him: He is furious that Italy should have to “beg” for money. What’s more, this rescue money could come from the European Stability Mechanism, an emergency cash box created during the euro crisis, its funds carrying harsh conditions. For many Italians, accepting assistance from it feels humiliating; hence the call for corona bonds instead. Yet the Italian populists merely wield a sentiment, while the Germans have an argument. Corona bonds are simply not necessary to master the crisis.\nFirst, rescue funds would come without tough conditions for Rome this time around. The German finance minister made it clear that it would be “inappropriate” in the current situation to make aid dependent “on fundamental debates about the pension system, the tax system, and the labor market.” So it’s baseless to reject the European Stability Mechanism as a mean, disciplinary tool.\nIn addition, the European Central Bank has already decided to buy extra state bonds this year to the tune of 750 billion euros, nearly $814 billion. This act of solidarity enables Italy and other southern European states to keep their sovereign bonds low, meaning they can borrow much more cheaply than they would otherwise be able to. In other words, Europe is printing money to help Italy. A third fund, possibly worth around 1.5 trillion euros, has been suggested by the European Commission and will be up for debate on Thursday, too.\nThe truth is that the challenge for the European Union is far bigger than the usual quarrel between north and south. Europe needs to generate money for continentwide reconstruction — for a new Marshall Plan. But the coronavirus has been weakening Europe’s economic immune system, leaving it unable to defend itself. The European Commission has warned, for example, that China could go on a shopping spree, buying out hundreds of cash-strapped European companies.\nSo the real question for Europe should be how to strengthen its defenses. Possible steps would be to make the continent a more friendly place for start-ups, cutting red tape wherever possible, especially in sectors like climate-friendly technology. It’s time for vision. How about Europe strives to bring the first hydrogen-powered airplanes to the world market, for a start? While the ruinous effects of the coronavirus have given rise to extraordinary solidarity, it is of a compressed, jealous kind. That attitude needs to change, north and south.\nAnd yes, there is need for strong symbolic action, too. Here’s an idea that would help immediately: Germany currently has 10,000 free intensive-care beds, while Italians and other Europeans are dying because their health care systems are overstretched. More critically ill patients should be airlifted to the country to receive treatment — not just a few dozen, but a few hundred. That should be a moral imperative.\nEurope’s past has been difficult, often antagonistic. But the union is strongest when it builds a common future where countries can thrive together.

A few concert halls are now trying to counter this trend this by going ahead without an audience — and sharing live-streams online instead.\nThe world-famous Teatro La Fenice in Venice remains eerily quiet as the Dafne string quartet enters the stage. The musicians walk up and take a bow — despite the fact that there is no audience inside the massive concert hall, which can seat more than 1,000 people. As the four artists take their seats, violinist Federica Barbali can't help but chuckle at the awkward and unusual situation.\nFor a moment, you can hear a pin drop throughout the stunning rococo theater, originally built in 1792; then the quartet starts to play Ludwig van Beethoven's String Quartet No.4, Op.18 No.4. And as the music fills the void, you're suddenly reminded of the fact that you're watching this event from the comfort of your home.\nThe show must go on\nThe Teatro La Fenice decided to live-stream the concert online, as Italy is effectively under a nationwide lockdown. Cultural events have been canceled throughout Italy and Europe in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus. But that doesn't mean that all public life has to stop; in order to ensure that cultural life continues, organizers are coming up with new formats to channel their events.\nOn Twitter, the concert stream by the Teatro La Fenice is one of many things shared under the hashtag #iorestoacasa — which translates as \"I'm staying home.\" Italians from across the country are using the hashtag to talk about their lives under quarantine conditions and to show solidarity with those who have been infected by the coronavirus.\nBut there's also a sense of solidarity with the string quartet, performing under such unique circumstances. As the online audience continues to comment on the performance, mostly expressing their gratitude for the beautiful concert, one user reminds the other viewers that they are still watching a musical performance — by shushing them on the digital realm as if they were inside the theater.\nThe Dafne string quartet is by far not the only group of classical musicians resorting to streaming as an alternative during these challenging times. The Symphony Orchestra of Giuseppe Verdi in Milan was also forced to play in front of an empty house earlier in March while streaming the concert online. Their chosen hashtag during the stream was perhaps a more poetic one: #Lamusicanonsiferma — the music won't end.\nIn neighboring Switzerland meanwhile, the Lucerne Orchestra had to find a different solution. After returning from a tour in northern Italy last month, all musicians were placed under quarantine. Facing the reverse problem of having a full auditorium but no orchestra to play during a performance of Richard Strauss' opera \"Salome,\" the organizers decided to offer a simple piano accompaniment instead.\nNo country in the world was hit as badly by the coronavirus crisis as China, where the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra was also forced to cancel its shows. Instead of performing on stage, many of the musicians took to the Chinese social media hub WeChat, where they shared videos of their music practice at home, as well as instructional videos.\nMuseums in China had already started sharing social media posts about their collections back in January in hopes of helping those under quarantine conditions overcome their boredom.\nSustainable alternative?\nAs the coronavirus outbreak is also hitting Germany, several theaters and concert houses decided to take precautions in accordance with regional guidelines on large public gatherings. In Cologne, the Gürzenich Orchestra canceled all events with an audience of more than 1,000 people following recommendations by German Health Minister Jens Spahn to that end.\nGeoffry Wharton, who was the concertmaster of the Gürzenich Orchestra for over 30 years, says that in his long-spanning career, he had never seen anything like the measures taken now.\n\"I've witnessed cancellations before but nothing like this. The closest this actually came was to the experience I had on the 11th of September, 2001. Nobody knew that day what the proper thing to do was. They obviously thought about canceling the concert completely but the musicians were all there, so what they ended up doing was they changed the program. But even then, we didn't cancel,\" the US musician and composer told DW.\nLike the orchestras in Italy, the Gürzenich Orchestra also decided that instead of cancelling, it would also consider live-streaming as an option. Wharton says he was happy to see the orchestra try new things, as he followed a recent performance online in real time. However, he added that it might not be a sustainable solution in the long-run: \"It was nice that they did it this way, but the thing is that people actually want to go to these concert halls to see shows. And when they have to stay at home for months instead, the model of live-streaming may not be a viable solution,\" Wharton said.\n\"And this is where I worry about a lot of my colleagues and friends who are freelance.

Producers would \"meaningfully cut back activity\" to preserve cash flow and balance sheets, although it depends in specific companies' hedging positions.\n- And per a note this morning from the risk analysis firm Verisk Maplecroft's Niamh McBurney: \"The impact of this on U.S. shale producers, and how much they may retrench, is what OPEC, and specifically Saudi Arabia and Russia are banking on to be able to return them to their pre-2016 positions, or at least close.\"\n3.

", "text": "Russians watching state-controlled television witnessed an unusual spectacle on April 31. Like wooden actors in some grammar school drama, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin dutifully reported via video link to President Vladimir Putin that he had tested positive for Covid-19 and would go into self-isolation as a protection to his staff. He even recommended that Putin appoint Andrei Belousov to replace him temporarily. The scenario ended with Putin doing just that.\nWhy stage such a show?\nAny other country in the world would have simply reported that the prime minister had fallen ill, had informed the president and had checked into the hospital. End of story. In Russia, though, nothing is ever that simple.\nThere had to be a reason why they trotted out Mishustin for this show. It means that in some Kremlin office with plush carpets and massive oak tables, senior officials debated the question and reached a weighty decision.\nAnd they wanted to announce it Western-style, like an episode of “The Crown.” For all appearances, it would be no different from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson informing Queen Elizabeth II that the coronavirus had left him temporarily indisposed.\nBut the Russian version did differ in at least one major way: the Kremlin authorities had spent the last 20 years convincing the people that their leaders are powerful, unaccountable to the public, and rock solidly enduring.\nSo why shatter that illusion now?\nBefore answering, we must ask whether this was the only such episode in recent days. No, it was not. These days, Russian officials regularly give public statements with something resembling transparency — as much as that is possible for people who have not practiced sincerity for a very long time.\nIt does seem that official statistics for the number of confirmed Covid-19 infections in Russia are accurate. Even though the figures do not include the sudden surge in deaths from pneumonia that are most likely attributable to the novel coronavirus, the overall progression of cases perfectly matches mathematical models predicting its spread — the same models that revealed the exact extent of ballot stuffing in previous elections.\nAfter initially secluding himself in quasi-quarantine, Putin has begun making almost weekly appeals to the nation and conducting frequent live briefings. It is in this context that we should consider the announcement of Prime Minister Mishustin’s illness.\nRussian citizens instinctively expect their leaders to lie to them during crises — just think “Chernobyl” — but the authorities now seem intent on proving that they are not hiding anything.\nWith tens of millions of Russians on lockdown and deprived of their livelihoods, it is clear that Kremlin leaders in that very same meeting decided not to pour fuel on this smoldering fire of constant irritation.\nRussia’s leaders are at a loss as to how to proceed with their Constitutional amendments and they are likely to face cheap oil prices and a weakened economy long after the pandemic subsides.\nThey either cannot or do not want to make direct payments to citizens suffering financial loss. So all they can do is at least try not to lie and to act like Boris Johnson with the queen. For Putin and his pals, that is already a lot."}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-guidelines-issued-for-confused-teachers-t96873w0m", "title": "Coronavirus : Guidelines issued for confused teachers", "text": "Coronavirus: Guidelines issued for confused teachers\nSchools and colleges are today to receive guidance on what to do if they come into contact with the coronavirus amid confusion over how to handle an expected rise in cases.\nHead teachers in areas where the virus, officially known as Covid-19, has been detected have been telling parents that they will authorise absences for families wishing to self-isolate.\nPublic Health England (PHE) is today expected to publish guidance clarifying that schools where a staff member or pupil is suspected of having the virus do not need to close.

Photo: Mark Mitchell - Pool/Getty Images\nNew Zealand has flattened the curve of novel coronavirus cases after two weeks of lockdown and the next phase is to \"squash it,\" professor Shaun Hendy, who heads a scientific body advising the government on COVID-19, told Axios.\nWhy it matters: Te Pūnaha Matatini, the Center of Research Excellence hosted by the University of Auckland of which Hendy is director, released research Thursday showing there could've been hundreds more Covid-19 cases were it not for the lockdown — and there's a good chance the strict measures will help stamp out the virus.\n- The country imposed 15 days ago some of the toughest restrictions in the world in response to the pandemic, despite confirming only 102 cases and no deaths at the time.\nHow it works: Under alert level 4 restrictions, schools and non-essential businesses closed — including food delivery services. Only essential travel is permitted, and water activities like swimming are banned.\n- People must remain at home unless they're exercising outdoors — but they have to stick to their neighborhood and only interact with those in their household \"bubble,\" keeping at least 6.5 feet from others.\n- A New Zealand Police spokesperson told Axios that 367 Covid-19 breaches had been recorded, including 45 prosecutions, as of Wednesday. People have been arrested for offenses like obstruction of a person assisting a medical officer, or being in breach of the Civil Defense Emergency Management Act.\nWhat they're saying: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told a briefing Wednesday she's \"cautiously optimistic that we are starting to turn a corner,\" as she announced 50 new cases — the lowest daily coronavirus total in two weeks amid a surge in testing. On Thursday, health officials announced 29 new cases.\n- Hendy noted there had been a \"flattening off\" of cases in the past week. \"We haven’t seen any further growth,\" he said. \"We had that big rise in numbers, mostly driven by people coming back from overseas and we seem to have managed to have contained that growth.\"\n\"The fact that our numbers have stayed level, that’s due to our lockdown. ... We can be pretty optimistic we’ve flattened it and now it’s about can we bend it right down, can we squash it?\"— Hendy on the coronavirus curve\nBy the numbers: New Zealand has 992 confirmed infections, 247 probable cases and one death from 51,165 tests, according to the Ministry of Health. 317 people have recovered from the virus.\nWhat's next: If COVID-19 is contained, New Zealand is expected to drop to alert level 3, which the country only experienced for two days before moving to full restrictions.\n- Ashley Bloomfield, director-general of health, told a briefing Monday this would involve \"more widespread activity happening with more people back at work, but maintaining those strict things around physical separation, hand hygiene ... to prevent infection.\"\nThe big picture: Ardern acted decisively early on. New Zealand had six confirmed cases when she announced on March 14 a ban on foreigners entering the country, saying: \"We must go hard and we must go early.\" Businesses and workers have been compensated in a range of measures as part of a $12.1 billion support package.\n- The response has been bipartisan, with Opposition Leader Simon Bridges offering his support to the government. Following pressure from his National Party and epidemiologists, Ardern announced Thursday all returning New Zealanders must be quarantined in isolation for at least 14 days from their arrival date.\n- Ardern has been widely praised for her leadership during the coronavirus crisis, and for reassuring children at a news conference this week that the tooth fairy and Easter bunny are essential workers.\nEditor's note: This article has been updated with new details on the modeling, fresh restrictions and more statistics."}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/26/coronavirus-prevention-how-effective-are-masks-closed-borders-screenings-and-quarantines", "title": "Coronavirus prevention : How effective are masks , closed borders , screenings and quarantines ? ", "text": "Numerous tactics are being employed by nations and individuals around the world to protect themselves from the spread of the coronavirus, or COVID-19.\nSome methods are personal, such as the purchase of a face mask, while others are deployed on a large scale to detect the SARS-like illness ahead of time.\nBut which of these preventative measures are the most effective - and are any of them simply unproductive?\nPoint of entry screenings\nScreening for COVID-19 at airports and other points of entry has been widely criticised due to the incubation period of the illness.\nIt is believed that infected people can be asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms in the first 14 days and yet still be contagious.\nBy the time more noticeable symptoms have arisen—enough to be picked up by thermal scanners—a person may have passed through several screenings undetected already.\nOne recent study estimated under \"best-case assumptions\" that such screening measures would miss around 50% of cases.\nAnother predicted a slightly better outcome of only 46% of infected travellers entering a country undetected.\nClosing borders\nThe recent outbreak in northern Italy has led to Austria—bordering to the east—considering whether to implement border control.\nFrance, which borders to the west, has said it is not yet considering such controls but has admitted the situation is \"worrying\".\nHowever, studies into the effectiveness of travel bans and restricting borders have found the method may delay the spread of an illness, but probably won't quash it.\nA University of Boston-led study found the lockdown of Wuhan—the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak—on January 23 may have been too late as other Chinese cities would have received lots of infected people by this date.\nIt said: \"The travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only three to five days.\nBut on the international scale, it added, there would be a \"more marked effect\" where it is estimated \"the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February.”\nOthers have compared it with travel restrictions put in place to quell the spread of influenza—which is believed to be less transmissible than COVID-19—and found “limited effectiveness of this policy”.\nAccording to a piece by scientists at the Yale Institute for Global Health: \"International travel bans have to be highly restrictive (i.e. discontinuation of over 90% of air travel) to have any impact.\n\"Even then, these restrictive measures only slightly delay the spread of the infection and have a very small impact on the magnitude of outbreaks.\"\nMasks\nThe Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends people only wear masks if they are exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 \"to help prevent the spread of disease to others\", but those who aren't should not.\n\"If an individual is infected...a face mask would help prevent transmission to others,\" Jennifer Lighter, a hospital epidemiologist and assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine told Euronews.\nBut \"there is no reason for the general population to wear face masks,\" she said.\nOthers have pointed out the distinction between two types of mask that people are investing in most - the N95 respirators and surgical masks.\nBoth masks serve different purposes when worn.\nFor example, the respirator keeps air particles away from the mask wearer, whereas the surgical mask stops germs from the wearer's mouth reaching anyone else.\nThe N95s are \"designed to protect the user\" whereas masks \"protect the patient,\" Joseph Kwan, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told AFP.\nQuarantine\nGovernments have put into place quarantine and self-isolating procedures for anyone who has been infected or exposed to the virus.\nThe Yale Institute for Global Health points out that quarantines are effective when a disease is transmissible ahead of symptoms being present - which is believed to be the case of COVID-19.\nBut others have pointed out the sensitivity of getting the quarantine right.\nSpeaking to the National Geographic, Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University professor who is also director of the World Health Organisation Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law, said the recent quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship was an \"unmitigated disaster\".\nThousands of passengers were isolated aboard the ship off the coast of Japan for two weeks after a case of COVID-19 was confirmed.\nThe number of cases between passengers and crew in the early stages rested at ten people, but a fortnight later had surpassed 600.\n\"What should have happened is, they [the passengers and crew] should have been disembarked from the boat and placed in isolation or medical quarantines,\" Gostin said.\nCancelling events\nA number of huge events around the world, including the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, a Six Nations match between Italy and Ireland, and other major sporting meets, have been affected after organisers cited concerns over COVID-19.\nThe World Health Organisation has advised that the cancellation of public events should be considered in the case of \"widespread community transmission\" of the virus being established.\nBut, some events organisers predict that other factors are involved in such decisions outside of high-impacted areas.\nREAD MORE:\n- Don't 'panic' says EU health chief as cases climb faster than China\n- The wild COVID-19 coronavirus conspiracies — and why you should ignore them\n- Latest breakdown of deaths and infections worldwide\nEvent management expert Julius Solaris, who runs an event management blog part of Skift, said there could be factors relating to the number of attendees to any particular event being cut due to travel restrictions or fears of corporate liability if a company sends a representative to an event only to get sick.\nSpeaking specifically about the Mobile World Congress, he said: \"We all can safely assume that Asia is a hot market for mobile phones.\n\"Not having attendees from the countries under COVID-19 watch is a big drawback for those investing money in the event.\"\nHe added: \"This is the case for many events around the world.

In the space of a single day, February 13th, China’s ruling Communist Party fired the officials who run the province and city at the heart of the epidemic of covid-19, announced a big jump in the number of recorded virus infections there, and sent in hardliners close to Xi Jinping, the country’s supreme leader, to clean up the mess.\nThe unusually brutal reshuffle saw the top party post in the central province of Hubei, where more than 48,000 infections and 1,310 deaths had been recorded as The Economist went to press, handed to the mayor of Shanghai, Ying Yong, who is 62. Mr Ying’s background is in public security, the law courts and the feared discipline-inspection commission that roots out malfeasance by officials. He earned Mr Xi’s trust while serving as a police chief and discipline inspector in the coastal province of Zhejiang, when Mr Xi was Zhejiang’s party boss from 2002-07.\nPublic anger is seething over weeks of bungling and cover-ups by officials responsible for fighting the virus in Hubei and Wuhan, the provincial capital. A handful of brave doctors, academics and relatively outspoken journalists have been pleading with national leaders to allow for more openness and free debate to avoid further deadly policy blunders. Mr Xi and his inner circle appear to have granted half that request, offering greater transparency about virus numbers, matched with sterner party discipline.\nState media are at pains to note that new cases outside Hubei have been growing less common since February 4th. But on February 12th Hubei reported 14,840 new infections, a sharp rise. This followed instructions from the central government to count not just cases confirmed by nucleic acid tests performed on nose or throat swabs (kits for that are in short supply and not always reliable), but also patients whose lungs show telltale signs of covid-19 on CT scans.\nHubei’s new chief, Mr Ying, indicated his preferred approach to governing a province in remarks he made in Shanghai a few days before his transfer. He praised “non-sloppy” administrations that are brave enough to endure strict supervision. Mr Xi’s war on sloppiness will be fought in Wuhan, a city of 11m people that has been under lockdown for weeks, by Wang Zhonglin, who has taken over as the city’s new party chief. He is also an ex-cop.\nAfter some days of hesitation, when Mr Xi was unusually absent from state media, the Chinese president and party chief appeared on February 10th in Beijing to inspect a hospital and address hard-pressed doctors in Wuhan by video link (see picture). Wearing a face mask and submitting to a nurse who took his temperature, Mr Xi pledged victory in a “people’s war” against the virus, but also expressed concern about the economic costs of nationwide quarantines. His emphasis on the party’s absolute leadership is reflected in the latest personnel moves. During a deadly outbreak of the SARS virus in 2002-03, the health minister and the mayor of Beijing were sacked. The reality has always been that such government officials are outranked by party leaders at each level of administration. The reshuffle in Hubei makes that explicit.\nOther officials with experience of high office in Zhejiang are being deployed. One of them is Chen Yixin, the secretary-general of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the party’s main law-enforcement body. He has been sent as Mr Xi’s envoy to oversee virus-control work in Wuhan. Meanwhile Xia Baolong, who was Mr Xi’s deputy in Zhejiang, has been appointed head of the central government’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, putting a Xi loyalist in charge of another crisis—anti-government unrest that has roiled Hong Kong since June.\nAmong China’s embattled Christian community, both Mr Chen and Mr Xia are notorious for leading a campaign to strip crosses from the roofs of churches in Zhejiang. When trouble strikes in Mr Xi’s China, the party sends for the hard men. ■\nThis article appeared in the China section of the print edition under the headline \"The hard men\""}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/coronavirus-chinese-scientists-false-rumours-experts", "title": "Experts fear false rumours could harm Chinese cooperation on coronavirus", "text": "Experts fear false rumours could harm Chinese cooperation on coronavirus\nWorld-leading specialists offer support to Chinese scientists amid ‘crackpot’ theories that virus was manufactured in a lab\n- Coronavirus – latest news\nWorld-leading experts on the novel coronavirus have signed a statement of support for their Chinese colleagues, who are being attacked on social media and even threatened with violence as false rumours circulate about its origins.\nThere is a real risk that the open and transparent relationship between the Chinese scientists and their western counterparts will come to an abrupt end, impeding the sharing of data and the hunt for treatments and vaccines against Covid-19, warned Dr Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance in the United States, whose research into emerging diseases led to the identification of the bat origin of Sars, among others.\nDaszak is one of 27 prominent public health scientists from nine countries who have signed the statement published by the Lancet medical journal. They include Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust in the UK, Jim Hughes, former director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases in the USA, Rita Colwell, former head of the US National Science Foundation and other leaders in infectious disease research and public health.\n“We work very closely with the Chinese scientists. We have had incredible openness with the labs in China for the last 15 years, since Sars,” said Daszak. “We collaborate on what are dangerous viruses and get incredible information that helps public health around the world. That is all under threat right now.”\nThe Chinese scientists and their families have been abused on social media and threatened with violence. They are saying, said Daszak, “we are not going to talk, because every time we speak we get criticised and threatened”.\nConspiracy theories circulating on social media claim the coronavirus was artificially manufactured in a lab conducting bioweapons research. They are “crackpot theories that need to be addressed, but in the age of social media it is just impossible,” said Daszak.\nAs with the conspiracy theories around MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination, those promulgating the rumours are in their own social media echo chambers.\nAnd as with anti-vaxx theories, the unfounded rumours have then been amplified by mainstream politicians such as the US senator Tom Cotton, and international news platforms such as the Daily Mail.\nThe signatories to the statement, says Daszak, have put their reputations on the line in support of their Chinese counterparts who are being targeted. “There are scientists out there trying to save our lives,” he said. “They have been doing this for 15 years since the Sars outbreak.”\nThe Lancet letter is a “statement in support of the scientists, public health professionals, and medical professionals of China combatting Covid-19”.\n“The rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins. We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2) and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens,” it says, linking to all the scientific evidence published so far.\nThe director general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom, has also warned against rumours and misinformation, speaking of the “infodemic” that needs to be fought alongside the epidemic.\nThe statement continues: “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus. We support the call from the director-general of WHO to promote scientific evidence and unity over misinformation and conjecture. We want you, the science and health professionals of China, to know that we stand with you in your fight against this virus.”\nIt calls on other scientists to sign up to the statement. The signatories have also launched a change.org petition for public support."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-budget.html", "title": "Germany Bans Groups of More Than 2 to Stop Coronavirus", "text": "BERLIN — Germany on Sunday barred groups of more than two people from gathering, except for families, and Chancellor Angela Merkel later said she herself was going into isolation because her doctor had tested positive for the coronavirus.\nMs. Merkel said she would isolate herself at home effective immediately after learning that a doctor who vaccinated her against pneumonia on Friday was infected, her office said in a statement. The chancellor will be tested regularly in coming days while carrying out her duties from home.\nNews that their leader was in quarantine quickly overtook headlines about the far-reaching social-distancing measures she had just announced.\nThe new rules, which will be in place for at least two weeks, are among the strictest imposed by any country on movement outside the home, and they came as global infections surpassed 300,000 and the death toll topped 13,000. In Germany, the number of confirmed cases had risen to more than 23,900 by Sunday, with more than 90 deaths.\n“The coronavirus is spreading with worrying speed through our country,” Ms. Merkel said in a televised news conference on Sunday.\nIn the absence of a vaccine or a cure, she said, it is up to people to curtail their interactions, she said.\n“Our own behavior,” she said, “is currently the most effective antidote we have: to reduce public life as much as is possible, to reduce contact with people through whom the virus could be transmitted.”\n“In short,” she said, “that’s how we save lives.”\nThe chancellor, a trained scientist, has won wide praise for her calm and transparency during the crisis.\n“We have to learn from experts — and from observing reality,” Ms. Merkel told Germans on Sunday.\nEven with the chancellor in isolation, officials said, the government will continue operating as planned, with the cabinet preparing on Monday to make 150 billion euros — more than $160 billion — available to help the country weather the fallout.\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak\n- Nations tackle lockdown next steps.\n- Coronavirus cases rise in India as lockdown eases.\n- Putin’s approval rating plummets as Russian crisis deepens.\nUnder the new restrictions, restaurants, which were previously allowed to seat customers during the day at a safe distance from each other, will be allowed to stay open but provide only delivery and takeout services.\nOther businesses that had previously been allowed to stay open, among them hairdressers, massage studios and tattoo parlors, must now close their doors.\nPeople will still be allowed to go to work, and to leave the home to care for relatives, shop and visit their doctors. Meetings deemed essential and exams can still take place, and people will be allowed out to go outside to exercise or get some fresh air — as long as everyone keeps a distance of 1.5 meters, or four feet, from one another.\nMs. Merkel’s announcement, made after a telephone conference with the governors of Germany’s 16 states, came after restrictions were put in place by the state of Bavaria, which on Friday severely limited movement outside the home.\nIn a major concession to the new reality, the German government also planned to take on debt for the first time since adopting a law requiring a balanced budget after the 2008 financial crisis. It is expected to approve an exception and borrow tens of billions of euros to help companies survive the looming recession and to secure millions of jobs.\nThe package is expected to be passed by Ms. Merkel’s government on Monday and voted on in Parliament later in the week.\nFinance Minister Olaf Scholz justified the decision to borrow more than 10 times more than the country’s budget rules would normally allow, saying that “150 billion is a very big sum, but it gives us the opportunities that we need now.”\n“We have a big challenge ahead of us,” he told the public broadcaster A.R.D. on Saturday.\nGermany is just one of many countries limiting crowds to promote social distancing and stall the transmission of the coronavirus.\nThe United States government has said that no more than 10 people should gather in one place. Switzerland says people in groups of fewer than five must stay at least two meters (six and a half feet) apart, of face a fine. Austria’s chancellor, too, announced major restrictions on movement in public places, banning gatherings of more than five people.\nThe stringent restrictions imposed in Germany on Sunday were announced after the authorities said too many Germans were not following social distancing guidelines set last week.\nThe chancellor thanked the many Germans who have radically changed their lifestyles. And she warned those who have not yet done so that the rules are not optional.\n“These are not recommendations by the state,” she said. “They are rules that have to be followed in our collective interest,”\nThose who disobey them, she said, will be punished.\nIn a direct appeal to those who have taken a casual approach to social distancing, the chancellor said: “Please all join in. Do what is right for out country. Show reason and heart.”\n“I am convinced this collective spirit, this ‘we stand for each other,’ will carry us through this difficult time,” Ms. Merkel said.\nSome German cities have needed no prompting to clamp down.\nIn Freiburg, near Germany’s southwestern border with Alsace, France, the virus has been particularly aggressive in its spread, and local officials last week barred groups of people from gathering in public spaces.\nStill, some other Germans have taken a far more cavalier, even defiant, approach.\nThere have been reports of “corona parties” held by youths in different corners of Germany, causing alarm among the authorities in a country better known for its citizens’ adherence to the rules. Some of the parties, where youths in large groups drank alcohol and chanted, “Corona, corona,” had to be broken up by the police.\nOn Wednesday, Ms. Merkel, in a somber address to the nation, asked Germans to avoid social contact in a spirit of solidarity with those most at risk in society. A day later, her chief of staff, Helge Braun, issued a sterner warning.\n“We call on everyone to implement the measures so far passed,” Mr. Braun said. “And that means, apart from your core family, avoiding ideally all social contacts.”\n“We will look at the behavior of the population this weekend,” he said. “Saturday is a decisive day.”\nMs. Merkel, meanwhile, demonstrated what responsible shopping looks like in the time of the coronavirus when she was spotted at her local supermarket in Berlin this weekend.\nKeeping her distance from other shoppers, a smiling chancellor placed cherries, soap, several bottles of wine and toilet paper — one pack — into her shopping cart, photos on social media showed.\nThe chancellor paid by card, joining those Germans dispensing with a time-honored tradition: paying cash. Many stores have become averse to exchanging coins and notes during the outbreak.\nMs. Merkel acknowledged the toll the new rules of behavior are taking in a society used to freedom.\n“Today we see everywhere in Germany that our cities, our traffic, our economic and private life look completely different from only a week ago,” she said. “I thank you for it. I know it means economic and human sacrifice when shops have to close, when you can’t just mingle with other people, or what is even more painful, see grandparents, meet friends.”"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/china/2020/02/17/the-coronavirus-spreads-racism-against-and-among-ethnic-chinese", "title": "The pathogen of prejudice - The coronavirus spreads racism against and among ethnic Chinese | China", "text": "“YO VIRUS-BOY! Don’t infect us!” So Andrew Zhou, a Chinese-Canadian in Vancouver, has been taunted in the school playground. On February 8th Hao Chunxiang, a Chinese university student in the Netherlands, complained on Facebook that the lift in his dormitory had been spray-painted with the words “DIE CHINESE”. In Japan the hashtag #ChineseDon’tCometoJapan has been trending on Twitter. Rhea Liang, a doctor in Australia, tweeted that one of her patients had refused to shake her hand because of her ethnicity.\nAmid global anxiety about the spread of the new coronavirus, first detected in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the tens of millions of ethnic Chinese living outside China and Taiwan are particularly uneasy. Anecdotal evidence abounds that fear of the virus is generating racial phobia against them. The virus has so far infected more than 70,000 people and killed more than 1,700.\nPolitical leaders have expressed concern. The prime ministers of Canada and Australia, which have large ethnic-Chinese populations, have publicly condemned anti-Chinese racism resulting from the outbreak. So, too, has the Chinese government. Its foreign ministry has repeatedly warned against discrimination by foreigners, referring both to ethnically targeted attacks and to perceived insults to China itself. A cartoon in a Danish newspaper of the Chinese flag with its stars replaced by coronaviruses was one cause of outrage, including on Chinese social media, where many called the artwork racist. Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, responded that “we have freedom of expression in Denmark—also to draw.” The World Health Organisation has come up with a name for the disease, covid-19, that is intended to avoid any association with China.\nEthnophobia triggered by the virus is sometimes subtle, and hard to separate from overblown fears of the pathogen itself. A waiter at a Chinese restaurant in London’s Chinatown says business is down “by at least 70%” since the virus began to spread globally in mid-January. Far fewer customers who are not ethnic Chinese are turning up, he says. A Malaysian student at University College London says he decided to skip class for a week in late January because “half the class is Chinese”. He worried that some students may have received infected relatives from China over the lunar new year holiday.\nSome ethnic Chinese are fighting back. A social-media campaign in France, using the hashtag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus (“I am not a virus”), has inspired hundreds to share their own stories of rudeness. Some are non-Chinese Asians who say they have suffered collateral damage. In Australia, some ethnic-Chinese have launched a petition accusing two newspapers of using racially offensive language in connection with the virus. Tens of thousands of people have signed it.\nEthnic Chinese themselves sometimes indulge in virus-related profiling, by fearing or suspecting people from Hubei province where Wuhan is—or even mainland Chinese in general. On February 2nd, when America banned the entry of any non-American who had recently been in China, many Western commentators complained about its discriminatory undertones. Canada did not follow America’s lead. But Ryan Zhang, who lives in Burnaby, a Canadian city where a third of the population are ethnic Chinese, says most of the ethnic Chinese in his community want Canada to do so. He says they have a paranoid fear that travellers from China wanting to enter America might first stop in Canada for a while and infect others before going on.\nPerhaps the biggest fissure within the diaspora relates to hostility among people from Hong Kong towards those of mainland origin. Recent pro-democracy unrest in the territory has exacerbated such tensions. One Canadian of Hong Kong origin refers to mainlanders who buy up surgical masks in Canada as “locusts”. This is a popular epithet in Hong Kong for people from across the border who go on shopping sprees in the territory, emptying shelves of goods. Ethnic solidarity is sometimes absent even within China itself."}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-crisis-hopes-raised-of-flight-for-cruise-britons-7w3ng7dtg", "title": "Coronavirus will hit iPhone supplies", "text": "British couple quarantined on Diamond Princess test positive for coronavirus\nA British couple who have been quarantined on a cruise ship off Japan for the past two weeks have tested positive for coronavirus.\nDavid and Sally Abel have been held in quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is docked off Yokohama, since February 3, and are now among 454 passengers to have tested positive for the virus.\n“There is going to be a time of quiet.

But if there was ever a moment where the country thought the polarized legislative branch might unify, it would be a moment like this one: as the nation confronts the deadly coronavirus pandemic that has swept many parts of the globe and is now spreading across the U.S. and disrupting years of economic gains.\nBut in the Capitol, nothing is that simple.\nAfter a whirlwind 48 hours of negotiations with the White House, the House passed a broad coronavirus response package early Saturday morning that includes free testing for those in need, expanded food assistance programs and Medicaid funding for overworked local governments, and two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave.\nRelated\nThe legislation passed overwhelmingly Saturday – 363 lawmakers supported it, 40 opposed, and one voted present. But the opposition was still along partisan lines; all 40 lawmakers who opposed it were Republicans. (Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican party last year to become an independent, voted present.) Those voting against the bill argued that the text was provided too late for them to cast an informed decision, because the new text was officially released within an hour before voting started. \"Voting on a multibillion-dollar piece of legislation less than 30 minutes after being introduced is no way to conduct the People’s business,\" Rep. Debbie Lesko wrote on Twitter.\nThe final price tag was not immediately clear.\nThe legislation now heads to the Senate, which returns to Washington on Monday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had dismissed Democrats' initial version of the bill released March 11th as an \"ideological wish list\" said in a statement that while the chamber would need to review the bill, he believes \"the vast majority of Senators in both parties will agree we should act swiftly to secure relief for American workers, families, and small businesses.\"\nBut the scramble to actually pass the legislation, and the dramatic two days that preceded the House vote, was symptomatic of the partisanship that has dominated the 116th Congress and has continued to grip the Capitol as the magnitude of the coronavirus crisis became increasingly clear. Even as a Senate aide was diagnosed with the virus Thursday evening and several lawmakers have self-quarantined, Congressional leadership from both parties rushed to reach an agreement on the contours of the stimulus package. By Thursday evening, the greater Washington area had effectively begun preparations to shut down, and Congress had been slated to begin a previously scheduled recess. But the Capitol, while now closed to tourists, was still filled with lawmakers unable to find consensus. It would take them another relentless 24 hours to do it.\nPresident Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose rocky relationship reached a nadir after his impeachment, did not speak throughout the negotiation process, with the President deputizing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to hammer out a deal. \"There is no need for that,\" Pelosi told reporters Friday night when asked about their lack of discourse.\nBut even though Mnuchin and Pelosi spoke nearly two dozen times in two days, the fate of bill garnering bipartisan support was still in Trump's hands, because Republicans would not support it without his explicit endorsement. And up until Friday evening, he was sending mixed messages. During his press conference Friday afternoon, he said the Democrats were not \"giving enough\" in negotiations. And he did not officially endorse the bill until 8:42 p.m. on Friday, nearly a full three hours after Pelosi announced Democrats had reached an agreement with the administration. \"I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening. This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers,\" Trump tweeted. He did not mention the involvement of Pelosi and House Democrats, who had crafted the initial legislation.\n\"We appreciate the President joining us with his tweet,\" Pelosi told reporters.\nThe sticking point in the negotiations, according to Republican and Democratic aides, was the paid family leave provision. Republicans were concerned that the policy would overburden the Social Security Administration, rendering the policy ineffective, and overwhelm small business. The final bill includes tax credits for small businesses, and exemptions for business with fewer than 50 employees.\n\"We could have passed our bill yesterday,\" Pelosi said prior to the vote. \"But, we thought it would be important to assure the American people that we are willing and able to work together to get a job done for them.\"\nUltimately, the House achieved that objective – even if the path there was rocky."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52137160", "title": "Coronavirus : The young doctors being asked to play god", "text": "Coronavirus: The young doctors being asked to play god\nWhen the tannoy blasts out a \"Team 700\" alert at Elmhurst hospital in Queens in New York City it is because a \"crash\" team is needed immediately. Someone is going into cardiac arrest.\nIn normal times that would happen maybe once a week. Yesterday, during the course of one 12-hour shift, there was a Team 700 announcement nine times. Not one of the patients survived, according to the young doctor I spoke to.\nShe is one of the residents in emergency medicine, and nothing in her training could have prepared her for the harrowing scenes she is witnessing on a daily basis at the epicentre of the epicentre of this outbreak. The hospital, which has a capacity of 282 beds, is now housing over 500 patients, according to the latest email sent round by the hospital administrators.\nAnd though it has not been declared as such, it is the first Covid-19 hospital in the country. Yes, the ER still functions - but all other patients who were admitted have been moved out. Only those who are gasping for breath are given beds.\nIn the initial stages of the outbreak, it was the worried well who would be turning up in this poor neighbourhood, Elmhurst. Now everyone is sick. Really sick. Half of the patients are undocumented, and don't speak English - they work in restaurants and are hotel chambermaids. They are not \"plugged in\". The calls for social distancing have passed them by.\nAnd this medic, in her early 30s, tells me the stress is intense. Nearly everyone who arrives at the ER needs to be intubated and put on a ventilator. That would normally be a job done in the Intensive Care Unit. But they are overloaded.\nThese people need \"pressors\" - meds that will keep blood pressure up. And that is a job normally done by specialist nurses. But there aren't the nurses to do it. So people who are untrained are having to do it. \"How can I not worry when there are patients not getting the care that they need?\"\nAnd she says it is not just the old who are falling prey to this. \"There are patients in their 30s and 40s with no pre-existing conditions. Equally, we had a 90-year old man the other day who was brought to the ER after he had fallen at home. He had a broken leg - but he also tested positive for coronavirus - even though he was exhibiting no symptoms.\"\nIt is a confounding virus, is Covid-19.\nThe hospital has been given double the number of ventilators that it originally had - but they are already being fully utilised and they need more. All are being used - and the peak of the curve is still weeks away. And she talks rather quietly when she describes a situation where not all of the people who need a ventilator are getting one.\nI spoke to this young doctor after she had got home from a 12-hour shift. We were connected by a mutual friend. She said she would call me after she'd put the washing on, cooked herself something to eat, and done a bit of life admin. The mundanities of life co-exist alongside the high stress, life-and-death environment that she is living in.\nShe says she is not frightened for herself. \"I am not worried about whether I fall ill. I will be fine. I'm young, and fit. I had a bit of a sore throat last week, and may well have had it. But the medics who are older, who have more complex medical histories are very nervous.\" A dozen of her co-workers, though, have fallen ill.\nElmhurst the epicentre - by the numbers\n- At least 47,500 people have tested positive in New York City as a whole - but the outbreak has not spread evenly\n- Elmhurst and Corona have led New York in terms of confirmed cases: 831 and 947 respectively as of 31 March.\n- In Corona, the median household income is approximately $48,000 (£38,806), a marked drop from the city's median of about $60,000\n- These working class neighbourhoods are in Queens, the hardest-hit borough according to New York Times data, with 616 confirmed cases for every 100,000 residents\n- Wealthier Manhattan and Brooklyn have counted 376 and 453, respectively, per 100,000 residents.\nIn normal circumstances, if you see a patient who you think is infectious you put on PPE (personal protective equipment), and when you have finished your consultation you take off the overalls and mask and they are incinerated. At Elmhurst you start your shift wearing PPE, and you will not remove it all day - after all, everyone you're seeing is infectious.\nThat has alleviated some of the pressure on kit. Also, the fact that this hospital has been the first hospital to be so much in the front line, and has had so much publicity, has meant that supplies have been forthcoming. She says, though, that her N-95 mask has to last a few days. But what happens to the hospitals further down the road? Will they get the kit they need?\nI ask her whether she has had time to reflect on the enormity of what is happening. \"A bit,\" she says. But says that will probably come later. She says the focus right now is on doing her job, and saving as many lives as she can.\nAs she tells me this, the thought strikes me that if you're driving a car on a mountain road and the brakes fail, you haven't got time to ponder the vicissitudes of existence, you're just trying to get down the mountain safely.\nThis woman is calm, self-assured and having to be mature beyond her years.\nThen she opens up on the bits that are hardest about what she is doing, and concedes that much of what she has gone through will need a lot of processing afterwards\n\"The most anxiety I have is around ventilator allocation. Seeing people die is not the issue. We're trained to deal with death. Nor is it the volume of people dying. The issue is giving up on people we wouldn't normally give up on.\"\nShe described a patient being brought in from an old people's home. He was already on a ventilator - and was \"chronically vent dependent\". His prospects were never great. But all she could see before her was the ventilator - and not the patient.\n\"When he came in we were so desperate for vents,\" she told me, \"all I wanted to do was get the ventilator off him. I wanted to get that vent off him to allow it to go to someone else.\"\nPlaying god is not what this young woman thought she would be doing at this stage in her career.\n- A SIMPLE GUIDE: What are the symptoms?\n- US v ITALY v CHINA: How do death rates compare?\n- LEADING THE WAY: The US governor who saw it coming early\n- ON FRONTLINE: 'Nurses prepare for the worst but not this'\n- REASON TO HOPE: The good that may come out of this crisis"}, {"url": "https://time.com/5831424/california-city-official-ousted-after-saying-covid-19-could-fix-burdens-on-society-if-allowed-to-spread/", "title": "Ousted City Official : COVID - 19 Could  Fix  Society If It Spread", "text": "A California city planning commissioner has been removed from his office after posting on social media that COVID-19 should be permitted to spread and possibly infect people who are elderly, mentally ill, homeless or others he said are “drains on our resources.”\nThe city council for Antioch, Calif., unanimously voted on Friday during a special council meeting to remove city Planning Commission Chair Kenneth Turnage II in response to a pointed Facebook post the commissioner wrote on April 23. The council members sharply criticized Turnage’s statements and cited a public outcry for the need to address them. Council Member Lori Ogorchock said that she found Turnage’s comments to be “very insensitive and callous, especially towards the elderly” and that she had heard concerns about them from older residents.\nRelated\nIn Turnage’s statement, which was re-posted by East County Today, he called for an end to \"stay at home\" orders, which are intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus, and to “let nature run its course”. Turnage compared the virus to a forest fire, which will destroy part of the forest “that drain the resources of the forest and [cause] it to be unhealthy.” Turnage said that while many elderly people would be lost to the virus, “that would reduce burdens in our defunct Social Security System, health care cost (once the wave subsided), make jobs available for others and it would also free up housing in which we are in dire need of.”\n\"This would run rampant through [the homeless] and yes I am sorry but this would fix what is a significant burden on our society and resources that can be used,\" Turnage concluded, \"In my opinion we need to adapt a herd mentality. A herd gathers it ranks, it allows the sick, the old, the injured to meet its natural course in nature.\"\nTurnage defended his comments during the special council meeting as free speech “intended to spark a debate.” He argued that there is a scientific basis for the principal of ecological balance and accused council members of engaging in “race-bating,” and of violating his First Amendment rights.\n“My personal opinion had nothing to do with the city, or my position on the planning commission. So to try to somehow link them or create a nexus to further your political agendas is shameful,” Turnage said. He said that he was sorry that he could have chosen different “analogies.”\nCity Attorney Thomas Lloyd Smith, who had recommended that the city remove Turnage, said that the question at hand was not Turnage’s First Amendment rights, but “the reaction and the impact that this speech has had on the residents of Antioch and the confidence and the trust in the government.” Smith noted that because Turnage is an appointed official, not an elected one, it is the responsibility of the city council to hold him accountable.\nDuring the public comment period of the meeting, multiple members of the public expressed concern that Turnage had sullied Antioch’s reputation and had expressed a lack of empathy for the elderly, homeless and mentally ill. One member of the public described Turnage’s worldview as “sociopathic” and “Nazi-like,” especially because his position is responsible for helping to provide seniors with housing.\nOthers have expressed concern that Turnage is being silenced. Mike Burkholder, publisher of East County Today, defended Turnage in an opinion piece, while acknowledged Turnage is a friend of his.\nTurnage did not immediately respond to a request from TIME for comment."}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/26/a-new-marshall-plan-meps-debate-coronavirus-response", "title": "A new Marshall plan ?

His wife now puts his food on the stairs. He’s run out of things to watch on Netflix. At odd hours, he walks in New York’s Central Park, keeping 10 feet away from others.\nLipkin is among hundreds of people in the U.S. and thousands around the world who, although not sick, live in semi-voluntary quarantine at home. With attention focused on quarantined cruise ships and evacuees housed on U.S. military bases, those in their own homes have largely escaped notice.\nThey, too, experts say, play a crucial role in slowing the spread of the new viral disease now called COVID-19.\nMost cases and nearly all deaths have been in mainland China. Around the world, authorities are urging two weeks of home quarantine and symptom monitoring for travelers returning from there.\nIt’s the only tool they have.\n“We don’t yet have a vaccine and we don’t have approved drugs for prevention of disease or treatment of disease. So all we have is isolation,” said Lipkin, who directs Columbia University’s Center for Infection and Immunity.\nAn expert virus hunter, Lipkin was invited by Chinese health authorities to help assess the risk posed by COVID-19. He did similar work in China during the SARS outbreak in 2003.\n“This is my second time in the slammer,” said Lipkin, who spent time in quarantine then. He will end his confinement Tuesday, celebrating with a dry martini in public.\nThe numbers in home quarantine are constantly changing and hard to pin down. New York state, for instance, has received the names of more than 350 who recently returned from mainland China. Local health departments are monitoring them, recommending quarantine for those without known exposure to the virus.\nState and U.S. guidelines sort people into high-, medium- and low-risk groups and have advice for each group, but local health departments have discretion in how to carry out the quarantines.\nAuthorities in Taiwan have fined those who violate quarantines, but so far U.S. officials are relying on people’s sense of responsibility, though they have the power to order a quarantine and get help from police to enforce it. Breaking a quarantine order is a misdemeanor in most states. Violating a federal quarantine order can mean fines and imprisonment.\nSome have put themselves in quarantine without an order from health authorities. In Highland, Indiana, Ken and Annie Zurek finished 15 days of self-imposed home quarantine Thursday.\n“We grew together as a couple,” Ken Zurek said. “I can’t think of any other person I’d want to spend in quarantine together.” Their confinement began after returning early from a trip to Chongqing, China, to meet their new granddaughter. Ken Zurek, a 63-year-old concrete business owner, had read up on the virus and added a 15th day to their quarantine “because I was a Boy Scout, always trying to be prepared and do the right thing.”\nPat Premick, a 57-year-old executive coach who had been living in China, has been in self-quarantine in the Pittsburgh area since returning to the U.S. early this month. On Friday, she said she has two days left.\nTo keep busy, she’s been doing puzzles, reading books and talking to friends in China who are going through the same thing. Since there aren’t many people in the area where she’s staying, she takes occasional walks. Friends have been leaving food for her outside, which she fetches after they walk away.\n“I’m waving from the window,” she said.\nIn Seattle, public health workers buy groceries to make sure the people stay comfortable while in home quarantine, bringing one person blueberries, bananas and hair conditioner. Another person confined to a motel room asked for and received an instant teapot to heat soup. The health department workers make sure people have Wi-Fi so they can work and stay connected to family. They arrange calls with counselors for those with anxiety.\nSeveral hundred returning travelers are staying away from others while they monitor their symptoms in Seattle’s King County, where the health department is spending about $200,000 a week on efforts to contain the virus.\n“It’s a little bit crazy right now,” said Dr. Meagan Kay, who heads King County’s containment efforts.\nIn India, health authorities have advised a 28-day home quarantine for returning travelers, much longer than the two-week incubation period accepted elsewhere. In Kerala, a state in the southernmost tip of India with three confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 2,300 people are quarantined at home. They are told to sleep wearing a medical mask and call a helpline if they feel stir crazy.\n“It is absolutely boring to be in your room for 28 days,” said Dr. Amar Fetle, who heads the response in Kerala.\nIn Nordmaling, Sweden, the owners of a Chinese restaurant said they are following health authorities’ guidelines by voluntarily quarantining themselves after a trip to China. They are closing their restaurant until Feb. 27.\n“It is to protect ourselves and our customers,” Stanislav Maid told the newspaper Aftonbladet. He runs the restaurant with his wife, Zhou Weixiang. “I have gotten quite a lot of positive reactions from people in the area who think it’s good we take our responsibility.”\nIn Shanghai, China, home quarantine for journalist Michael Smith of The Australian Financial Review newspaper, began when he returned from a trip to Hong Kong.\n“I imagine this is how prison must feel,” Smith said in an email to The Associated Press on Friday, two days into a 14-day confinement. Smith can work at home, but no visitors are allowed and guards are monitoring the only entrance to the housing compound where he lives. He’s finding “an odd comfort” in not worrying about appointments and wearing track pants all day. “I’m treating this as a rare opportunity to read some books, binge watch some Netflix series and get some rest.”\nIsrael’s Health Ministry on Sunday extended a two-week home quarantine for people arriving from mainland China to include those who have recently spent time in Thailand, Macau, Singapore and Hong Kong.\nIn New York, Lipkin finds in the COVID-19 outbreak echoes of the movie “Contagion,” for which he was chief science adviser. He has heard the movie has gained new popularity, and he hopes people are learning from it, washing their hands and listening to public health authorities.\nHe takes his temperature twice a day and reports by email to the medical officer at Columbia, which directed him into home confinement. Unlike others in his situation, he was able to send a swab sample from the back of his nose and throat to his own lab to test for the virus. The result was negative. No virus.\nHe uses an exercise bike, but most of the time, he works.\n“There’s more work than I can possibly do because not only am I running the laboratory at Columbia and writing and dealing with media, but I’m also running programs in China,” he said. “I’m not getting a lot of sleep.”\nLipkin and his wife, Katherine Lewis, are keeping their sense of humor. “My wife is terrific,” he said. “She’ll make dinner for me and leave it on the stairs and say, ‘I’m putting it down here so I don’t have to get your cooties.’\n“I hadn’t heard the term ‘cooties’ in probably 50 years.”\n___\nAssociated Press writers Candice Choi in New York and Aniruddha Ghosal in Delhi contributed.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

But most Americans shouldn’t necessarily be avoiding crowds and airplanes at this point, experts say. Instead, some risk assessment, both on an individual level and a societal level, is going to be required..\nRead: You’re likely to get the coronavirus\nCurrently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all Americans avoid nonessential travel to five countries: China, Italy, South Korea, Iran, and Venezuela. Some companies, including Twitter, have suspended all employee travel. But beyond that, there are weddings, conferences, vacations, and funerals to get to by plane. COVID-19 is transmitted through coughing or sneezing, so staying six feet away from people will help minimize the risk that someone else’s cough droplets will land on you. If you’re getting on a plane, however, that won’t be possible. And the closer you’re sitting to a fellow passenger who’s sick, the likelier you are to get COVID-19 from that person.\nOn a more typical day, the average American city dweller might take a crowded train to a packed, open-plan office, then go to a bustling PTA meeting after work. According to Chu, people who already have a chronic illness or are at risk of getting one should avoid these types of crowds as much as possible. This includes people with cancer, people over the age of 65, and people with respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, or even asthma.\nPeople with asthma are not more likely to catch COVID-19, but theyaremore likely to fare poorly if they do. Asthma and similar health conditions cause the lungs to have trouble exchanging air, a situation that viruses such as the flu and the coronavirus exacerbate by filling the lungs with inflammatory cells, Chu said.\nRead: What you can do right now about the coronavirus\nThere’s no hard cutoff for when a crowd becomes too risky for an asthmatic or elderly person. It’s not that, say, the opera is definitely off-limits but work meetings are guaranteed to be fine. Chu said she recommends that people who have asthma or a lung disease or are otherwise immunocompromised start thinking about telecommuting from work right about now.\nFor everyone else, decisions depend on what Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, calls personal “risk preference.” That is, how worried are you about catching COVID-19? If you’re relatively young, healthy, and traveling to a place other than the five restricted countries relatively soon, you might decide that the risk of catching the disease is worth whatever it is you’re doing. Adalja told me that he has not canceled any of his public appearances. Two other experts told me that it’s still too premature for healthy people living in areas without a large number of cases to avoid gatherings or otherwise change their plans. Instead, says Henry Wu, the director of the Emory TravelWell Center, in Atlanta, the advice is the same as it has been for the rest of day-to-day life: They should just wash their hands often, cough into the crook of their elbow, and avoid touching their face.\nOf course, for some people, staying inside for a few weeks would be easier than going a single day without a good face-touch.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Still, the country’s schools and businesses have started to voluntarily close without waiting for Lukashenko’s orders.\n— Lukashenko has maintained that none of Belarus’ Covid-19 deaths had been from the disease itself but from other accompanying ailments, including cancer and obesity. In mid-April, the leader who has touted vodka, the sauna and tractors as anti-Covid therapies asserted that “no one will die of coronavirus in our country. I publicly declare this.”\n— Lukashenko vowed to hold a military parade in Minsk marking 75 years since the Soviet victory in World War II, and on Tuesday invited fellow heads of post-Soviet states to attend it.

Virologist Thomas Pietschmann explains why spring really gives hope and why women have a clear advantage in the fight against the COVID-19 disease.\nCould warmer weather slow the spread of the coronavirus? If all goes well, the new virus SARS-CoV-2, may behave like the influenza virus. Then spring, with its rising temperatures, would kill the pathogens - and stop the spread of the COVID-19 disease. The coronavirus season would pass away just like the annual flu wave, which starts to ebb when winter ends.\nSpring may be the season of hope, but it's still too early to say accurately whether SARS-CoV-2 behaves as the influenza virus. Virologist Thomas Pietschmann says, experts can't yet predict the trajectory of the virus because \"honestly speaking, we do not know the virus yet.\"\nPietschmann is a molecular virologist at the Center for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, called Twincore, in Hanover, Germany. He researches so-called RNA viruses, including for example the hepatitis C virus. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to this group.\nVirus? Unknown!\n\"What's special about this virus is that humans are confronted with it for the first time. From the data we have from China, we can conclude that the virus has only once passed from an animal to humans and spread from there,\" says Pietschmann.\nUnlike influenza viruses, which nearly everyone has been in contact with at some point, our immune system is not prepared for an attack with corona pathogens.\nIn addition, the external conditions in the northern hemisphere are currently virtually perfect for the rapid spread of the virus. For one thing, there's the temperature. Respiratory viruses, i.e. those that spread via the respiratory tract, have a particularly easy time when the weather is cool. \"Viruses have greater stability at low temperatures. This is similar to food that keeps longest in the refrigerator,\" says Pietschmann.\nCool and dry, please!\nThe warmer it gets, the more difficult the conditions are for many viruses. \"The coronavirus is surrounded by a lipid layer, in other words, a layer of fat,\" Pietschmann explains. This layer is not very heat-resistant, which means that the virus quickly breaks down when temperatures rise. \"Other viruses, such as the norovirus, are more stable because they consist mainly of proteins and genetic material.\"\nRead more: Why coronavirus fears are disproportionate compared with other health risks\nFor other pathogens, temperature only plays a subordinate role. The dengue virus, for example, is mainly found in tropical and subtropical regions. But this has less to do with the pathogens liking warm weather: \"In this case, it is not the temperature that plays the main role in the spread of the pathogens, but the animal that transmits the virus,\" Pietschmann says.\nAir humidity also influences the transmissibility of respiratory viruses. Once the pathogens have been expelled from the respiratory tract with a strong sneeze, they literally hang in the air. \"On cold and usually dry winter days, the small droplets, together with the viruses, float in the air longer than when the air humidity is high,\" Pietschmann elaborates.\nIn this way, the pathogens can spread rapidly. However, at first they do this quietly and secretly. From the first contact with the pathogens to the first symptoms of the disease, several weeks can pass. The length of this incubation period depends on the characteristics and biology of the virus.\nDouble X chromosome and estrogen\nFever, pain and chills are typical symptoms of a viral disease and a sign that the body is fighting off the invaders. How successful this fight is depends not only on the age and health of the infected person, but on his or her gender. In the case of the coronavirus, the data shows that women have higher survival chances than men. At 2.8%, the mortality rate of men is significantly higher than that of women, at 1.7%.\nAccording to Pietschmann, this difference can be explained by genetics. \"Some immune-relevant genes, for example genes that are responsible for recognizing pathogens, are encoded on the X chromosome. Because women have two X chromosomes and men have only one, the female sex has an advantage here.\"\nRead more: Corona-phobia: Like SARS, coronavirus fear feeds racism\nThe female sex hormone estrogen also helps women fend of viral diseases. \"Some immune-relevant genes also have binding sites for estrogens, where these genes are switched on. This means that these genes are also controlled by the hormones,\" says Pietschmann.\nPerhaps the corona season will indeed end with the beginning of spring in the northern hemisphere. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), however, there are more than 20 cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Australia and one case in Brazil — in the southern hemisphere. Where winter is yet to come.\nPeople around the world are strapping on breathing masks to prevent a viral infection. Other measures are more effective, though.

After infections of COVID-19 on the Japanese island exploded following its annual winter festival this year, officials in February declared a state of emergency to control the disease. Soon after, new daily cases plummeted, and Hokkaido’s quick action was heralded as a beacon for the rest of Japan to follow.\nBut it wasn’t just infections that dropped; over the next month, agriculture and tourism business also dried up, and Hokkaido’s governor decided to ease social restrictions. However, compliance with limits on social interaction after weeks of sequestering was harder this time around. Within a month, Hokkaido’s new COVID-19 infections jumped by 80%, and the governor had to reinstate lockdown policies.\nThere are similar stories from Singapore, Hong Kong and Germany, and all serve as sobering lessons for the decision-makers in the U.S. who are under increasing pressure to reopen the country to reactivate its stalled economy. The tension is built into the pandemic: while public-health metrics all point toward extended social isolation and a more gradual reopening of society, the decisions are made by politicians. Already, some state governors are allowing businesses such as nail salons, barbershops and gyms to reopen to prevent bankruptcies and economic ruin.\nHow to proceed? The U.S. urgently needs to restart, but no economy can function if an infectious disease like COVID-19 continues to sicken the workforce and keep customers to a trickle. More than a million Americans have had the disease, but it is not yet known whether recovering can provide lasting, or any, immunity. Which means much of the country’s nearly 330 million people remain at risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the illness, in a too-sudden return to normal. “Even in the hardest-hit places [in the U.S.], fewer than 1 in 10 people have been infected. So not only could COVID-19 come roaring back, but it could get five times or close to 10 times worse than it is now,” says Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives and former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “The only way forward is to suppress cases and clusters of cases rapidly.”\nUnder President Trump’s guidelines for Opening Up America Again, states would move through three phases of gradually loosening social restrictions. The threshold for entering each stage toward normality is declines in the number of new COVID-19 cases in the previous 14 days. Gyms, movie theaters and sports stadiums would be the first to reopen, although people would have to remain 6 ft. from one another and avoid intimate gatherings of more than 10. Next, schools and bars could reopen with limitations, and finally, if cases continued to decline, most people could return to work. Health experts warn, however, that the return to normality can’t be only a straight progression–if cases start to inch upward, then social distancing and shelter-in-place directives will have to be renewed.\nThe only way to calibrate those decisions is to know where the new infections are. When it comes to conquering an infectious disease, the adage “know your enemy” is remarkably apt. Or, even more important, know where your enemy is. Tracking an invisible virus is the key to controlling it, and the quickest and most reliable strategy for that is to build a robust system to test anyone who might be infected. For the U.S. to reopen its economy, “We’re going to have to find those people who are infected, and not just wait for them to come to us,” says Barry Bloom, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “The bottom line is, it’s testing, testing, testing–so we know where the epidemic is before we can relax any stringencies in a stepwise fashion.”\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, tells TIME, “We must have in place the capability that when we do start to see cases come back–and I’ll guarantee you that they will–to identify by testing, [and then] isolate and contact-trace to get people out of circulation who are infected.”\nIt may take tens of millions of tests per week to do that, and the problem is the U.S.’s testing capacity may not be ready yet. “There is absolutely no way on earth, on this planet or any other planet, that we can do 20 million tests a day, or even 5 million tests a day,” says Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health who is overseeing the government’s testing response.\n1. TESTING\nWidespread testing can yank away the curtain that hides SARS-CoV-2, revealing where there are clusters of people who are infected by the virus but not showing symptoms, and thus aren’t aware they might be spreading it to others. That, in turn, will lead to more targeted efforts to isolate anyone who is infectious. And, if all the people who came in contact with an infected person were also tested, it would help local health authorities trace how the virus is moving through a community. It’s basic, boots-on-the-ground disease control.\nThe U.S., however, stumbled on testing in the early days of the pandemic, and those failures led to a dramatic surge in cases that climbed more quickly than in other countries. Thanks to a combination of contamination issues that delayed the original test from the CDC, and regulatory requirements that prevented commercial and academic labs from immediately developing their own assays, “It’s still the case that testing isn’t nearly as readily available as it needs to be,” says Frieden. As of this writing, just over 1 million tests for COVID-19 are performed in the U.S. each week, which is woefully inadequate, Fauci says.\nPublic-health experts estimate that the current U.S. testing rate has to triple simply to include all the people who are considered highest priority for testing, including health care workers and nursing-home residents. To fold in all of those who should be tested if gyms and restaurants reopen, the number of daily tests has to increase by tens of millions. Ideally, anyone with symptoms like a cough, fever or shortness of breath should be tested, as should anyone who is sick and living in a group facility like a dormitory, along with any patient admitted to a hospital for any reason. Family members and others with close contact to someone who tests positive should also be tested.\nBoosting testing volume is about not just manufacturing more tests but also ensuring that they’re relatively easy to take. So at-home testing kits that are just becoming available–which still require a doctor’s prescription but won’t require people to go to a doctor’s office or health facility to provide a sample–will become more critical as states gradually reopen. Several companies are also offering COVID-19 tests, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that don’t require doctors or patients to sample from deep in the back of the nose and throat, but instead swab the inside of the nostrils or provide a small amount of saliva, making it easier even for non–health professionals to provide samples.\nWhile testing capacity in the U.S. is gaining ground, the road ahead remains long. The health system has never had to manage testing at the scale needed to control this pandemic, and doing so may require equally unprecedented solutions. Anticipating that the gap between testing need and testing capacity will only yawn wider as states reopen, the Rockefeller Foundation, for example, has proposed a coordinated regional command system for testing that would track and redirect supplies to where they are needed. The foundation’s action plan, backed by a $15 million initial investment, also calls for engaging hundreds, even thousands, of smaller labs that currently don’t perform tests for the public. So far, leaders from California and five U.S. cities are working to implement the plan and increase access to testing. (The foundation sponsored a recent TIME 100 Talk.)\n2. TRACKING\nOnce testing at scale is in place, local trends should dictate when and how a particular region might begin to emerge from self-isolation. Loosening of social-distancing policies won’t happen universally across the nation, since the burden of disease is vastly different from New York to Nevada. Each region–whether defined as a community, a state or a group of states–will have to make customized decisions about releasing its residents in phases based on its specific disease trajectory as well as its population density, among other factors.\nThere are, however, some universal benchmarks. Bloom and others believe new daily cases, identified by wide-scale testing, would have to fall consistently in a given region for at least two weeks before leaders can start discussing reopening businesses and schools. At that point, health experts would investigate where the new cases are. If they’re confined to local and sporadic clusters, that’s a sign that the virus’s circle of transmission is limited and potentially shrinking.\nSuch scenarios would mean not that the virus is necessarily going away, but that the local health system is in a decent position to manage the load of people who get infected. “We are not just staying home in the magical belief that the virus is going to go away,” says Frieden. “We are staying home so we can strengthen the health care and public-health systems.” The idea isn’t to eradicate coronavirus completely–at least not yet–but to bring its spread to manageable levels. As flare-ups occur, they can be doused with another critical contagion-fighting public-health technique: contact tracing. It doesn’t help to know who is infected if you’re not also investigating who else that person might have infected. In a study conducted in Shenzhen, China, researchers found that tracing contacts of people who tested positive helped reduce the time it took to isolate those who were infectious by nearly half.\nThis is the foundation of infectious-disease containment, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. Google and Apple are collaborating on a digital solution to contact-trace at scale using smartphone and search data, but concerns about privacy remain. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo has formed a partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the nonprofit Vital Strategies to build a first-of-its-kind training program to teach and certify contact tracers. The program will rely on call centers, digital technology and historical best practices to identify the contacts of people who are infected, track their whereabouts and the contacts of those contacts–and then educate those who need to self-isolate about how best to do that to protect the public’s health.\n3. IMMUNIZING\nTesting, isolation and contact tracing, however, are all essentially a backup plan for fighting an infectious virus like SARS-CoV-2. The only way to ensure that the virus won’t burn through a global population again is to build a better defense. And the most impenetrable fortress against a virus is immunity, gained–at the individual level–either by becoming infected and recovering or by getting vaccinated. “It doesn’t matter how much virus is out there, if people aren’t susceptible to getting it, then the virus will go away,” says Lisa Lee, associate vice president for research and innovation at Virginia Tech. Smallpox, for example, was eradicated thanks to immunization.\nThe goal is herd immunity: when nearly every person around the world develops these protections, the “herd” is able to protect the few, such as newborns, who aren’t protected or cannot be vaccinated. At this point, it is unclear if the human body naturally develops any after recovering from COVID-19. So as researchers work to figure that out, they are also racing to develop a vaccine. But although there are a variety of vaccine candidates in development and testing, it will likely take at least 12 months before the first people can be inoculated against SARS-CoV-2.\nWithout widespread immunity, public-health officials can only keep a close watch on new cases as they pop up, and suppress them so they don’t morph into widespread outbreaks. Which means that until the population at large is protected, some amount of social distancing will become a routine part of our lives. Even if a region shows all the right numbers–declining curves of new COVID-19 cases, fewer deaths and more hospital discharges than admissions–that doesn’t mean restaurants, sports arenas, shopping centers and workplaces should go back to the status quo. “Locking down isn’t just to lock down,” says Fauci. “It’s to give you time so that when you open up again, you can come out swinging … when the virus rears its head, you have the capability to identify, isolate and contact-trace and snuff it down before [cases turn into] outbreaks.”\n4. THE NEW NORMAL\nEspecially in hard-hit, densely populated areas like New York City, at minimum, everyone might need to wear face masks in public to prevent the spread of virus-containing respiratory particles; public-transit riders may not be sitting shoulder to shoulder; diners at restaurants might need to be seated 6 ft. apart; and we might significantly cut back on physical contact. “This may turn out to be the death of the handshake,” says Dr. Hilary Babcock, an infectious-disease specialist at Washington University School of Medicine.\nAccepting these changes to daily life is accepting the reality that emerging from this pandemic won’t be like flipping a switch. “This is a public-health emergency, and only public health is going to get us out of this,” says Frieden. “The economy, and society, depend on public health getting this right.” And that means not just testing and identifying people who are infected, along with their contacts, but rethinking how self-isolation fits into broader policy decisions. The massive quarantine of these past few months was unprecedented, but more limited isolation, on a case-by-case or family-by-family basis, may become the norm for at least a while. And public-health officials may have to work with local community leaders to accommodate more formal, structured ways to self-isolate in order to effectively balance the public good of such measures with the rights and dignity of individuals. For example, Frieden says, “we should be offering voluntary isolation for every person infected,” in the form of designated hotels or living quarters to support people who cannot stay in their current homes without putting others at risk.\nThese, of course, won’t be the only new ubiquities in a post-COVID-19 world. Microbial threats like coronaviruses will inevitably move from the bottom to the top of public-health priority lists, and the dangers of infectious diseases will loom larger in our collective conscious. They will have to, if we have any hope of avoiding further drastic lockdowns and forever changing the way we interact with each other.\n–With reporting by W.J.

It has run out of masks and does not have enough testing kits.\nA number of medical workers have also been infected, so there is a worry that they will soon run out of doctors and nurses to attend to those with the disease.\nThe majority of Iranians are extremely worried.\nWhat happened to the Iranian official?\n\"I had a fever as of last night and my preliminary test was positive around midnight,\" Mr Harirchi said in a video released on Tuesday.\n\"I've isolated myself in a place since... and now I am starting medication.\n\"We will definitely be victorious against this virus in the next few weeks,\" the minister added.\nMr Harirchi's positive test for Covid-19 was announced a day after he took part in a news conference, where he coughed occasionally and appeared to sweat heavily.\nDuring the briefing, the minister denied a claim by a member of parliament for Qom - the centre of the outbreak - that the authorities were engaged in a cover-up.\nAhmad Amirabadi-Farahani alleged that Covid-19 had arrived in Qom three weeks ago and that 50 people had died in the city alone.\nThe death toll was rejected by Mr Harirchi, who vowed to resign if it could be proven that even half that number had died.\nMr Amirabadi-Farahani subsequently refused to retract his claim, saying he had sent a list of 40 people who had died to the minister and awaited his resignation.\nMore on the coronavirus outbreak\n- How close are we to a pandemic?\n- What you need to know\n- A visual guide to the outbreak\n- Tell us how you've been affected by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nThe secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran Ali Shamkhani, said on Tuesday that he had asked the prosecutor-general to \"check the validity\" of the MP's allegation.\nMeanwhile, an MP from the Iranian capital Tehran, Mahmoud Sadeghi, said he had also tested positive for the virus\nCould cases spread through the Middle East?\nIran is believed to have been the source of the first cases reported by neighbouring Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman, which have now imposed restrictions on travel to and from the Islamic Republic.\nHowever there are fears that the many Muslim Shia pilgrims and migrant workers who will have travelled between Iran and other parts of the region in recent weeks could have already spread the virus.\nIn countries like war-ravaged Afghanistan - which has so far reported just one case - health authorities will struggle to trace and test contacts of infected people, experts say.\nThe WHO is sending medical supplies and additional testing kits to Iran and is also planning to send a technical team to the country.\nThe United Arab Emirates - a major international transit hub, and home to the airline Emirates - has suspended all passenger and cargo flights to Iran for a week \"as a precautionary measure\". The UAE has reported 13 cases, including an Iranian couple.\nBahrain's health ministry meanwhile raised its number of confirmed cases to 17.

The company that manufacturers it felt compelled to emphasize the danger of ingesting it after President Donald Trump’s musings about heat, light and disinfectant in the time of coronavirus.\nTrump’s thinking-out-loud theories took a turn toward hazmat territory this past week when he said it would be interesting to see whether people’s innards could get “almost a cleaning” from disinfectants. Doctors tweeted their alarm, worried that people will take Trump’s comment as a cue and swallow chemicals that will harm or kill them.\nTrump also gave weight through his bully pulpit to an unproved theory that heat and humidity might hasten the destruction of the coronavirus, suggesting people could be safer around each other in the outdoors.\nResearch pointing to that possibility is preliminary, other research has found otherwise, and this pandemic has spread in the tropics and Southeast Asia as well as through the northern hemisphere.\nTrump followed up Saturday with a baseless boast about testing.\nMeantime, Trump’s veterans affairs secretary went even farther than the president in talking up potential benefits of a malaria drug against COVID-19. It’s an area of speculation that his own agency says “displays a dangerous lack of expertise” by amateurs.\nA review:\nDISINFECTANT\nTRUMP, on the virus: “I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that ... you’re going to have to use medical doctors ... but it sounds -- it sounds interesting to me.” — briefing Thursday.\nTHE FACTS: No.\nThe fact Trump would even flirt with the idea prompted a statement from Reckitt Benckiser, parent company of the maker of Lysol and Dettol, that “under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).”\nClorox echoed that bleach and other disinfectants “are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.”\nThe U.S. surgeon general’s office moved to discourage people from thinking they can self-medicate from something in the house: “PLEASE always talk to your health provider first before administering any treatment/medication to yourself or a loved one.”\nAs the blowback unfolded, Trump said Friday he was being sarcastic the day before.\n___\nSUNLIGHT & HEAT\nTRUMP, on an unproved theory that sunlight, heat and humidity can destroy the virus faster than inside the house: “I hope people enjoy the sun. And if it has an impact, that’s great. ... And if heat is good, and if sunlight is good, that’s a great thing as far as I’m concerned.”\nTHE FACTS: Sunlight may be a disinfectant for the spirit and outdoor exercise is recommended in today’s social isolation, but there’s no proof it will make the pandemic go away. Without declaring that it would, Trump is again giving traction to a theory that could prompt people to let down their guard around others outside.\nWlliam Bryan, who leads the Homeland Security Department’s science and technology directorate, told the briefing about incomplete, “emerging results” from research that suggest solar light, heat and humidity might be effective at neutralizing the virus. Past studies have not found good evidence of that.\nDr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s emergencies chief, said in March that “it’s a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza.” Trump said early in the outbreak he expected it to end with the warmer weather of April.\n___\nTESTING\nTRUMP: “We have now Tested more than 5 Million People. That is more than any other country in the World, and even more than all major countries combined!” — tweet Saturday.\nTHE FACTS: Actually, the U.S. has tested far fewer people than “major countries combined” and lags dozens of countries in testing its population proportionally.\nTogether, just three major countries -- Russia, Germany and Italy -- have tested about 6.5 million people, compared with over 5 million in the U.S. And the United States is easily outdistanced when testing in other Group of Seven countries is added to the mix, as well as powers such as India. Moreover, the count does not include China, which has more than four times the population of the U.S. but has not published national testing numbers.\nMore than 30 other countries have tested a larger share of the population than has been done in the U.S., which was slow to make COVID-19 diagnoses available and still can’t offer it to everyone who might be infected.\n___\nROUND 2\nTRUMP, on the chances of the virus returning in the fall: “If it does come back — it’s not going to come back — and I’ve spoken to 10 different people, it’s not going to be like it was. ... If we have embers of corona coupled with the flu, that’s not going to be pleasant, but it’s not going to be what we’ve gone through in any way, shape, or form. ... You may not even have corona coming back, just so you understand.” — briefing Wednesday.\nTHE FACTS: His public health officials refuted his statement on the spot that the coronavirus won’t be coming back. As for his statement that it won’t be as bad in a second round, that’s more complicated.\n“There will be coronavirus in the fall,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said at the briefing. “I am convinced of that because of the degree of transmissibility that it has, the global nature.”\n“Next fall and winter, we’re going to have two viruses circulating, and we’re going to have to distinguish between which is flu and which is the coronavirus,” said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHow bad that will be will be determined by a range of factors that can’t be predicted with precision. Redfield said the situation may be more difficult than now because the coronavirus and the flu will be circulating at the same time, unlike during the bulk of the current pandemic. Or it may be less difficult if preparations and containment are better than now.\n___\nMALARIA DRUG\nVA SECRETARY ROBERT WILKIE, asked whether it’s safe to encourage people to take hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment: “Oh, I think so.” — interview Wednesday on MSNBC.\nTHE FACTS: That’s not what the government’s top health experts have said for weeks, nor what his own agency has suggested. A new alert Friday from the Food and Drug Administration further underscored why the drug cannot be considered generally safe in this pandemic and why it has not been approved by the FDA for treatment of COVID-19.\nLast month, the FDA authorized the narrow emergency use of the malaria drugs for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who aren’t enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. But regulators said they are investigating life-threatening side effects reported to poison control centers and other health authorities.\nIn one such report, doctors at a New York hospital said that heart rhythm abnormalities developed in most of the 84 coronavirus patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin, a combination Trump has promoted as part of his persistent and inaccurate portrayal of the malaria drug as a game-changer.\nThe drug has long been used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. A few, very small preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent the coronavirus from entering cells and possibly help patients clear the virus sooner.\nWilkie, as VA secretary, leads the nation’s largest health system. His agency’s own health care arm has criticized premature assessments on the effectiveness of the drug for the coronavirus. In an unsigned response to an audit report last month examining whether the VA had adequate stocks of the drug, top VA health officials called it “inaccurate and irresponsible” to assume hydroxychloroquine would benefit veterans for COVID-19.\n“There are active investigations into these drugs and many others, as discussed by Dr. Anthony Fauci,” according to the unsigned VA response to the agency’s inspector general. “Yet no conclusions have been made on their effectiveness. To insist that a 14 days’ supply of these drugs is appropriate or not appropriate displays this dangerous lack of expertise on COVID-19 and Pandemic response.”\n___\nWILKIE, on a nationwide study finding that a malaria drug had no benefit for treating COVID-19 among veterans: “That’s an observational study. It’s not a clinical study. It was done on a small number of veterans. Sadly, those of whom were in the last stages of life. And the drug was given to them. And I have to also say that the drug — we know the drug has been working on middle-age and younger veterans ... working in stopping the progression of the disease.” — interview Wednesday on MSNBC.\nTHE FACTS: He mischaracterized the study’s finding.\nWilkie rejected a study that relies on his department’s own hospital data and finds no benefit from hydroxychloroquine. His claim that it helps younger or middle-aged veterans with COVID-19 is also unsubstantiated.\nIt’s true that the study, done by independent researchers at two universities with VA approval, was not a rigorous experiment. Yet with 368 patients, it’s the largest look so far at hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, based on VA hospital data.\nResearchers analyzed medical records of male veterans hospitalized with confirmed coronavirus infection at Veterans Health Administration medical centers who died or were discharged by April 11.\nAbout 28% who were given hydroxychloroquine plus usual care died, versus 11% of those getting routine care alone.\nEven though people given the drug tended to be sicker than the comparison group, researchers statistically adjusted for that and still saw no benefit from the drug.\nThere is no other published evidence that the drug is safe or effective for younger veterans with COVID-19.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Marilynn Marchione in Milwaukee and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report.\n___\nEDITOR’S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.\n___\nFind AP Fact Checks at https://apnews.com/APFactCheck\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/4030470d394aec0c982acb55744b1648", "title": "Japan : 2 former cruise ship passengers with virus have died", "text": "2 former cruise ship passengers with virus die in Japan\nTOKYO (AP) — Two elderly passengers taken off the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess because they were infected with the new virus have died, Japan’s Health Ministry said Thursday, becoming the first fatalities from the virus-stricken vessel.\nJapan now has three deaths linked to the COVID-19 illness.\nThe ministry also announced 13 more cases on the ship, bringing the total to 634, by far the largest number in one location outside mainland China.\nThe two fatalities, a man and woman in their 80s who are both Japanese, were believed to have been infected before health checks and a Feb. 5 quarantine began on the ship, Health Ministry official Masami Sakoi said. It was not immediately known if they had any roommates on the ship.\nThey had been hospitalized on Feb. 11 and 12 and each tested positive a day later. It was not immediately known why they were not tested earlier when they developed initial symptoms and consulted with the ship’s clinic, Sakoi said.\nThe ministry also announced Thursday that two more government officials had became infected while providing clerical work on the ship to help in the quarantine effort.\nFour other officials — a quarantine official, a paramedic who carried an infected passenger, a Health Ministry worker and an emergency relief medical expert — have also been sickened.\nThe new virus began in China late last year and has sickened tens of thousands of people, mostly in central China’s Hubei province. With the 634 cases confirmed among the Diamond Princess’s original 3,711 people, Japan has more than 700 cases, including the country’s first death unrelated to the ship.\nThe Diamond Princess, docked in Yokohama port near Tokyo, started letting passengers who tested negative for the virus off the ship Wednesday, when the government-set 14-day quarantine ended. On Thursday, hundreds of other passengers were to leave in a disembarkation process expected to last through Friday. Test results are still pending for some people on board.\nJapan’s government has been questioned over its decision to keep people on the ship, which some experts have called a perfect virus incubator. Some medical experts who observed the quarantine process on board also raised caution over lax protective measures on the ship.\nKentaro Iwata, an infectious diseases expert at Kobe University Hospital who was on the ship as part of a medical relief team earlier this week, said in a YouTube video that he was alarmed by the lack of control measures, including distinctions between clean and contaminated zones, and the inadequate use of protective gear. He called it “chaotic” and said it made him scared of getting infected himself.\nIwata, currently in self-imposed quarantine at a hotel, blamed poor management of the quarantine in a video conference Thursday.\nHe said the Health Ministry-led operation implemented some measures, but “to me it was not good enough.”\nIwata also said Japan should follow the example of the U.S. and other countries in requiring an additional two-week quarantine for passengers after they leave the ship.\nHealth Minister Katsunobu Kato initially said those with negative virus tests had fulfilled the Japanese quarantine requirement and were free to walk out and go home on public transportation. Later on Wednesday, Kato urged former passengers to refrain from non-essential outings and try to stay home for about two weeks.\nAbout 440 passengers had left the ship on Wednesday, and Japanese officials said more than 1,000 others will be gone by Friday. The Diamond Princess was quarantined after one passenger who left the ship earlier in Hong Kong was found to have the virus.\nCrew members, who couldn’t be confined to their rooms because they were working, are expected to stay on the ship. In a preliminary report issued Wednesday, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases said the substantial transmission of the virus occurred before the Feb. 5 implementation of the quarantine and that a downtrend in the number of confirmed cases based on reported onset dates indicated secondary transmission among passengers was reduced during the process.\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said a more controlled health watch for the crew remaining on the ship would start as the passengers get off because they can can be isolated by using vacated passenger rooms. Some foreign crew members, however, are expected to return home on chartered flights sent from their home countries. Four South Korean crew members returned home with three passengers on Wednesday on a government-chartered flight.\nBefore the quarantine on the ship ended, the United States evacuated more than 300 Americans and put them in quarantine in the U.S. for another 14 days. Australia and Hong Kong evacuated their residents for quarantines as well, and Canada and Italy sent flights for their citizens.\n___\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-wedding.html", "title": "An Impromptu Wedding , Social Distancing Included", "text": "NEW YORK SHUTTERED\nAn Impromptu Wedding, Social Distancing Included\n“Love in the time of Corona,” the invite said. “Bring your own cups if you want to toast.”\nBy Corey Kilgannon and\nA phone played Mendelssohn’s “Wedding March” — somewhat drowned out by traffic — as Molly Rosner and Paul Anderson marched down a grassy slope in Riverside Park.

Scott Kelly, who spent 340 consecutive days on the ISS, suggests maintaining a busy schedule. Chris Hadfield, the Canadian astronaut best known for his rendition of “Space Oddity,” recommends learning a new skill.

We didn’t.\nThe more experts I spoke with for this story, the clearer it became that, actually, we have it worse than the astronauts. Spending months cooped up on the ISS is a childhood dream come true. Self-isolating for an indefinite period of time because of a fast-spreading disease is a nightmare.\n“In many ways, what we’re being asked to do is much harder than what astronauts have to do,” says Raphael Rose, a psychologist and the associate director of the Anxiety and Depression Research Center at UCLA, whose research includes stress-management techniques for astronauts.\nPrior to the past several weeks, astronauts were not faced with the particular stressors brought on by COVID-19, ranging from sickness to the sudden loss of their jobs. Even if they do stay employed, earthbound humans who are working from home might have a tougher work environment than space travelers do. Kelly wrote inThe New York Timesof his experience in space, “When I went to sleep, I was at work. When I woke up, I was still at work.” But astronauts don’t have their toddlers or teenagers on the ISS with them hogging the Wi-Fi and interrupting meetings.\nRead: Dear Therapist’s guide to staying sane during a pandemic\nAt mission control, there’s a whole cadre of personnel responsible for keeping astronauts happy and healthy. If something goes wrong, astronauts know exactly whom to call. For many Americans living through the COVID-19 crisis, that’s not the case. President Donald Trump told the country earlier this month that anyone who wanted a test for the virus could get one, but tests are still in desperately short supply. People concerned that they have COVID-19 symptoms are waiting in line at hospitals for hours only to be turned away at the end of the day.\nThe comfort of knowing that mission control is looking out for you—that anyone, in fact, is in control—is something that many Americans might welcome right now. That support can help reduce stress, says Sonja Schmer-Galunder, a social anthropologist at the research firm Smart Information Flow Technologies who studies group behavior, particularly in astronaut missions. A sense of unity helps too; it’s why we find videos of Italians singing to one another from their balconies, or Atlanta residents applauding medical workers during their shift changes, soothing. “Everybody’s waiting for our leaders to decide for us how our lives are going to continue,” Schmer-Galunder says. “While we are waiting and while we experience this stress together, it would be even more important to have leadership that communicates well to us that you are not alone, and we are all in this together.”"}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/louisiana-postpone-democratic-primary-coronavirus-7892875a-b015-4181-8783-af43de48d125.html", "title": "Democratic primaries in flux over coronavirus concerns", "text": "Democratic primaries in flux over coronavirus concerns\nPhoto: Matt Sullivan/Getty Images\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger announced Saturday evening the state's presidential primaries would be rescheduled from March 24 to May 19 in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak.\nWhy it matters: Georgia is the second state to postpone primaries over the outbreak as officials scramble to contain the virus, which had infected more than 2,700 Americans by Saturday evening.

He was feeling depressed and scared as COVID-19 spread to the United States, slowing the normal work of his organization and hitting his city especially hard. Then a friend sent him the proposal that would appear inThe Journal of Infectious Diseases.\n“It seemed like something I would want to do, were I eligible,” he told me. In 2011, when he was a corporate lawyer, he donated a kidney, accepting a small risk of death to save a life. An early vaccine for COVID-19 could savetens of thousandsof lives.\nRead: You’re likely to get the coronavirus\nMorrison launched the COVID Challenge, “a hub for people to volunteer and to advocate for safe and rapid vaccine development.” Anyone willing to volunteer for a human challenge trial can add their name to a list that can be winnowed as appropriate and handed over to interested vaccine researchers.\nRoughly 1,550 people have already signed up. And Morrison hopes that their eagerness will be taken seriously by government officials, ethicists, and scientists.\n“It is not a riskless thing,” Morrison said, “but neither is kidney donation. And each year, thousands in the U.S. and tens of thousands in the world do that … If you think this will move a vaccine forward by even a day and save thousands of lives, the ratio of volunteer lives lost to lives saved would be thousands to one. Any life lost is tragic, but that’s worth doing as a society if you have volunteers who know the risk.”\nG\navriel Kleinwaks is 23 and pursuing a graduate degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder. As an undergraduate at a small liberal-arts college, she had friends in the effective-altruism movement, and she still reads articles written by its public intellectuals. That’s how she found out about the COVID Challenge. And while researching human challenge trials, she discovered that Jonas Salk, her scientific hero for his work on the polio vaccine and his refusal to patent it, gave the vaccine to himself and his family before asking the public to take it.\nParticipating in the development of a vaccine, even in a small way, struck her as cool. And she explained to me that the religious tradition in which she was raised, Judaism, ingrained in her the notion that “for anyone who saves one life, it is as if they had saved a whole world.” Many try to save lives by donating time or money, neither of which she has done. “I am lucky in a lot of other ways, including good health,” she said. “I’m young. I don’t get sick a lot. This seems like a way that I can share some of that luck. I empathize with other people. The pain of losing someone you care about is the same no matter who you are.

Ireland’s Six Nations match against Italy that was due to be played in Dublin on Saturday has already been called off because of the recent outbreak of coronavirus in Italy, where there have been more than 650 confirmed cases and 17 deaths.\nSpeaking to an audience of health experts at a Nuffield Trust thinktank conference, Whitty, who is the government’s chief medical adviser, outlined steps that may be taken if the coronavirus becomes a pandemic.\n“Everybody knows that the kinds of things you consider – reducing mass gatherings, school closures, which may or may not be appropriate for this particular virus. We don’t know yet. We need to find that out.\n“Now, to be clear, we’re not saying we will do them, but we have to look at all of them and say: how likely are they to work? And what’s our evidence base here? What’s the social cost of this?\n“Because one of the things, frankly, with this virus much more so than flu, is whatever we do we’re going to have to do for quite a long period of time, probably more than two months. And the implications of that are non-trivial. So we need to think that through.”\nHe added: “This is something we face as really quite a serious problem for society potentially if this goes out of control. It may not, but if it does globally, then we may have to face that.”\nMinisters are finalising the government’s plan to respond to the increasing threat posed by coronavirus, which is expected to be published next week. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, insisted: “There is a good chance that we can avoid a pandemic. That’s a potential outcome but not a definite outcome.”\nHancock sought to reassure the public that the NHS would be able to cope with a sudden surge in cases by stressing that it had well laid plans based on a detailed document drawn up in 2011, which sets out measures that would be implemented in a flu pandemic.\nHe also rebuffed a suggestion that Boris Johnson should become more visible in order to reassure the public about coronavirus. Hancock, who chairs a weekly meeting of the Cobra committee from several government departments, said that a regular “drumbeat of Cobra meetings and meetings with the prime minister and meetings of the cabinet” showed the political priority that the virus was getting.\nBritain will inevitably record more cases than the 16 identified so far, Whitty said. He said that onward transmission in the UK was “just a matter of time in my view. If it is something which is containable, the UK can contain it. If it is not containable, it will be non-containable everywhere and then it is coming our way.”\nThe strategy to minimise the virus’s impact is based on four tactics: containing its spread, delaying onward transmission, researching its makeup and possible treatments, and mitigating its effect on the NHS.\nThe hope is to contain the virus for as long as possible and try to delay the peak of any major outbreak until the early summer, when warmer weather is expected to result in a drop in the number of cases, as with influenza.\nHowever, Whitty said thousands of non-urgent operations would be delayed if the NHS had to concentrate its resources on dealing with the virus.\nWhile the virus presented “some challenges”, the world was not facing a threat as deadly as the Spanish Flu outbreak in 1918, Whitty added. That is thought to have claimed 50 million lives worldwide.\n“Occasionally things come along which, no matter how good your strategic aim is, will knock you off course for a while. We are not heading into a H1N1 1918 flu pandemic situation, but the coronavirus does present some challenges for us. It definitely will for a period. How big remains to be seen,” he said.\nHis remarks came as Public Health England (PHE) said it had sent a health protection specialist to the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel in Tenerife, where four former guests tested positive for the virus and 168 Britons were among more than 700 people placed in quarantine. According to reports, 50 of the Britons quarantined at the hotel were allowed to leave on Thursday.\nPHE is due to launch a major public information campaign next week to educate people about how to minimise the risks of contracting or spreading the virus. Whitty stressed that regular handwashing remained the single best way of reducing risk.\nExperts in infectious diseases said that the two new cases identified in the UK early on Thursday were not a cause for concern and that the measures deployed in Britain so far – including isolating confirmed cases and tracing people they have been in touch with – were working. The Northern Irish case, in a patient who had recently returned from Italy, was confirmed later in the day.\n“There is no due cause for alarm,” said Prof Brendan Wren of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nDr Tom Wingfield, from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, added: “There are likely to be some more cases in the coming weeks but the UK public can be reassured that we have experienced teams in place to manage the isolation and care of people diagnosed with coronavirus and perform robust tracing and screening of their contacts.”"}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/corona-virus-out-of-control/av-52757134", "title": "Corona - Virus : Out of Control ? | News and current affairs from Germany and around the world | DW", "text": "COVID-19 is causing fear around the world.

Some divide the deaths by the number of reported cases of the disease to get a supposed fatality rate. That, in turn, often leads to the premature conclusion that some European countries are spectacularly better than others at keeping people with covid-19 alive.\nTake Italy and Germany. On March 25th Italy had recorded 74,386 cases of covid-19 and 7,503 deaths, the highest number in the world. Germany’s tally that day stood at 37,323 cases and just 206 deaths. Going by these figures, the fatality rate would seem to be around 20 times higher in Italy than in Germany. In fact, this is a spurious number, for several reasons.\nFirst, in any country the number of confirmed covid-19 cases is an unknown fraction of the actual number of cases. Both Italy and Germany have been testing lots of people. In Germany, where different doctors and regions have different practices as to whom they test, accurate national figures on the number of tests done are hard to verify. That makes comparing the two countries tricky. But the broad consensus seems to be that there has been a greater degree of testing in Germany, meaning that it is spotting more mild cases of the disease than Italy. Severe ones end up in hospital, where they are obviously easy to count.\nWhat is clearer is that the first wave of covid-19 infections in Italy was predominantly among older people, who are far more likely to die than younger people, even with the best of care. The median age of those diagnosed with covid-19 in Italy is 63 years, compared with 47 in Germany. The two countries have a similar share of older people in the general population. But only 20% of cases reported in Germany are people aged over 60, compared with 56% of those in Italy. The early German cases seem to have contracted the disease at carnivals and ski-resorts, which explains why the initial profile is so young.\nAnother reason why Italy’s death rate looks much higher is that its epidemic began earlier. Covid-19 deaths lag behind infections by several weeks. That means that for quite a time the disease can spread unnoticed. Italy’s first deaths were on February 22nd, Germany’s two weeks later. So a large number of Germans who are already infected will become sicker and die in the coming days and weeks. That is starting to happen. On March 23rd Germany’s cumulative number of covid-19 deaths jumped by 56%; the next day’s increase was 33%.\nLastly, Italy’s deaths would not be so numerous if its covid-19 patients had not overwhelmed its hospitals. The country’s epidemic has been concentrated in the Lombardy region, whereas Germany’s cases have been distributed more broadly across several hotspots. As the disease spreads in both countries, it will become clearer whether the German health system really is so much better than Italy’s at keeping covid-19 patients alive. ■\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus hub\nThis article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline \"A numbers game\""}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/wednesdays_papers_is_finland_taking_swedens_approach_to_beating_covid-19/11337166", "title": "Wednesday papers : Is Finland taking Sweden approach to beating Covid - 19 ?

Much of what Salminen espouses is opinion, though the media interprets it as fact, according to former IS editor-in-chief Tapio Sadeoja.\nIn his column, Sadeoja suggests that Salminen--who has also worked in Sweden--is both a believer in herd immunity and influenced by the neighbouring country's approach to the pandemic. Sadeoja says the government’s new hybrid strategy indicates Finland is taking Sweden’s path, albeit a slower one, meaning that many more people will still fall ill as the country moves towards achieving a level of herd immunity.\nThe columnist claims the government, following Salminen’s lead, is choosing not to consider the speedy development of a vaccine or effective medical treatment as other possible options for combating coronavirus.\nHowever, international experts still are not certain how much--or how long--a previous infection can protect a person from being infected by the virus again, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nOld and stuck at home\nFinland’s elderly need clear guidelines on how to go about their daily lives, the Swedish-language pensioners’ association tells Hufvudstadsbladet (HBL).\nThe group says many of Finland’s over-70s have interpreted official social distancing recommendations to mean not going out at all.

She had slept only three hours the night before in a hospital isolation ward. She worried constantly about her husband and three children.\n“I miss my children so badly. They miss me, and we all miss that we can’t hug each other anymore,” Preisler said in a phone interview on Monday.\nPreisler, who practices law and is a local politician in the Baltic Sea town of Barth, started experiencing symptoms a few hours after she tested positive for the new coronavirus last week. Her husband, a federal lawmaker, had tested positive earlier and been told to remain isolated in Berlin, a 299-kilometer drive (186 miles) away,\nThe couple’s 9-year-old twins and 11-year-old tested negative, but health authorities ordered the children quarantined at home with their mother. When Preisler’s symptoms worsened and she needed to be hospitalized on Saturday, her husband was permitted to go back to Barth to care for the children.\nLonely, frightened and unwell, Preisler turned to the internet for information from other patients but didn’t find many first-hand accounts of living with and fighting the virus. So she decided to share her experience on Twitter, where she had about 5,000 followers.\nUsing the hashtag #coronatagebuch, German for #coronadiary, Preisler has given frequent updates on her condition. She posted photos of herself with hollow eyes and her lower face masked., images of cleaning staff in protective gear removing contaminated clothes from her hospital room and another selfie showing her receiving oxygen through thin tubes in her nose.\nShe also wrote intimate tweets about how she was doing emotionally - sometimes well, sometimes not so well - at a time when people around the world worry about the virus but know so little about how COVID-19 can play out on a personal level for someone who has it.\n“Dear #coronadiary, today is my second day ... I am ill, the lung is like a big lump. I am whimpering like a whelp. The father will take over family life long-distance via Videochat. Corona is mean, bye,” Preisler said in one tweet.\nPreisler is one of some 7,300 people who have tested positive in Germany, a country with a population of 83 million, She has not contracted pneumonia, an illness seen in people with severe forms of COVID-19. But due to a preexisting health condition, the virus made her more sick than is typical for someone her age.\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with underlying health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks.\nOn the day after she tested positive, Preisler suffered from shortness of breath. She and her children marked off areas of their home with tape to create a makeshift isolation ward for mom while leaving the rest of the house to the healthy kids.\nPreisler was too sick to cook so the children took over the kitchen, making waffles topped with lots of powdered sugar and browsing cookbooks for recipes.\nFriends went grocery shopping and dropped the bags off in front of the family’s home since none of them were supposed to go inside.\n“They brought us lots of potatoes,” Preisler said. “So right now, the kids are into making potato chips.”\nOn Twitter, she sometimes relayed the latest developments with a grim sense of humor.\n“Dear corona diary, here’s a positive approach ... somebody who cannot breathe well saves food. It’s too exhausting (to eat). My fitness tracker is proud of my weight loss. Welcome hip bones, that I could live to see you again,” she wrote on Day 2 of her illness.\nWhile trying to cheer up her followers with cheeky tweets, Preisler felt progressively worse. She didn’t go to the hospital because she couldn’t leave her quarantined children alone.\nHer husband, who exhibited mild symptoms, got permission Friday night to drive home from the German capital - wearing full protective gear and without stopping even once for gas. The next morning, Preisler was admitted to the Krankenhaus am Sund hospital in the city of Stralsund. She started getting oxygen and inhaled medications that alleviated her shortness of breath. It’s not clear when doctors will release her.\nWith new infections dwindling in Asia, Europe has become the main front line of the pandemic that has infected over 190,000 people worldwide and killed more than 7,500 as of Tuesday. More than 80,000 people with the virus have already recovered.\nPreisler said she received positive and encouraging responses to her social media posts from all over Germany and Europe and from as far away as Winnipeg, Canada. There have also been hateful and negative reactions from people who called her stupid and worse for coming out in public as a COVID-19 patient.\n“Some people have really gone after us. It’s horrible,” Preisler said. “People are so afraid and insecure, especially those who don’t inform themselves about the virus.”\nThomas Sattelberger, a 70-year-old German lawmaker who tested positive for the virus on Saturday, said he had not received any negative responses after he posted videos on Twitter about his situation.\nSattelberger, Preisler and her husband all belong to the Free Democrats party. They are not sure where they picked up the virus, if they were infected by the same source or whether they passed the virus among each other.\nSattelberger said in an interview a main concern has been making sure health authorities inform people he might have had contact with that they could be infected.\n“It’s been 30 hours and I still haven’t been able to make a contact with the health authorities,” he said. “I’m worried because I have been in touch with so many people.”\nVirus hotlines were busy or went unanswered when he tried calling over the weekend, he said. So instead of relying on overwhelmed officials, Sattelberger reached out to contacts himself to warn them.\nSattelberger, who is self-isolated at his home in Starnberg, has not suffered from symptoms. He said he feels dazed and weak, has headaches and experienced chills on Friday.\n“My first response after the doctor called me with the results was shock,” Sattelberger said. “And from time to time, I still have to think about the fragility of humanity, as this virus is basically conquering the world.”\nLike Preisler, he has taken to Twitter to inform and encourage his 12,300 followers, hoping that a sense of humor may allay some of their fears.\nIn one of his videos, he held up a candy bar and flashed a big smile, saying his partner bought him chocolates and not “rice and peas,” which might have been a healthier choice but did not have the curative powers he craved under his current circumstances.\n“The overwhelming majority of people will go through this crisis well,” Sattelberger reminded viewers. “It will be difficult. It will stress us, but the majority will overcome all of this in a good way.”\n___\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Our reckoning of time has become \"before corona\" and \"after corona.\" At times, it feels like the typewriter of history is being frantically operated by a mad science-fiction writer for whom we are all guinea pigs. Unfortunately, the situation is neither science-fiction nor insanity but a new kind of real life where fear, not even the virus, is public enemy number one.\nPictures of an evening trip to the grocery store. People wearing masks, carrying baskets, buying food. Because the mask covers most of a person's face, the eyes stand out. There are calm and inquisitive eyes, while some looks are even indifferent. And then there are eyes that speak of fear. Trepidation.\nIt is probable that the person behind the mask is not sure whether they should be afraid of the virus, the fact that it's spreading, others who might be infected or how to cope should they catch it themselves. Or perhaps it is all of the above.\nInformation has become an unending flood. What to believe and what to read is one question, while the daily reality of the number of confirmed cases and deaths is another entirely. What this mortifying situation does is bring people face-to-face with themselves. And that fear is far beyond what any virus could conjure.\nFear\nIt is this fear that becomes a driving force for people in unexpected situations. To overcome the crisis, we need to start with fear. It is a battle where running some people down or lifting individual groups up is of no use whatsoever.\nDuring a time when the press is busy concentrating on mistakes made by the Health Board and a minister's unfortunate utterances or crowning those on the front lines of combatting the crisis kings, most of society is left looking on, while no less deserving of the title of hero.\nLooking on and working every day to ensure the best possible functioning of their company or agency by having to suddenly work remotely, being responsible for employees.\nLooking on are those who are isolated at home with their children, ensuring their own health and that of their offspring. Looking on are people who have donated or bought computers so children of less fortunate families could take part in remote study.\nThose who have made the difficult decision to cut their employees' salary, while having to keep them motivated. Those who have to live in the virtual certainty that they will not see a pay rise for months or years but still keep working. And those who cannot help out as volunteers after hours because their families and homes need them.\nLooking on are people who are afraid. Who sit at home and only leave the house if it cannot be avoided, not being able to tell whether a cough or an unpleasant feeling in their throat is COVID-19 or not because not everyone is tested. Those who go to the grocery store wearing masks and whose eyes betray fear because they have to keep at least two meters between themselves and people they might have had a conversation with while waiting in line only yesterday.\nAll of them are silently looking on as the press puts uncrowned kings on pedestals, hands out gold medals just in case despite the Olympics having been postponed and works on various other rankings.\nWhy create new subconscious rifts in society during difficult times? People need to be commended, of course, but it should not be done at someone else's expense in a crisis.\nEvery member of society is either consciously or subconsciously contributing to overcoming this crisis. By moving on with their daily lives and continuing to work as smoothly as possible in this flood of coronavirus news and under altered circumstances. By sticking together and refraining from manufacturing new fear. Because the latter is the greatest enemy today.\nAn unexpected situation forces a person to look themselves in the eye. Society is not a long jump pit where 5 centimeters makes you better than someone else. Nor is it a marathon course where the person who crosses the finish line first only to collapse on the other side of it wins. The gray area here goes far beyond what a black and white cast of mind can possibly grasp.\nAnger\nIn addition to fear, anger is another driving force in extreme situations. Finding oneself suddenly isolated at home forces another frank look in the mirror. That is why many now think back to the routine of going to and from work as they would their blessed childhood.\nStanding orders mean that people have to get used to a new daily schedule and spending all of their time with family members. The daily routine includes new tasks, sums spent at the grocery store have changed, while the possibility of domestic violence spiking has been discussed both in the Estonian and international media. This new situation takes some getting used to both psychologically and financially.\nLack of recognition is a chronic condition of our society, as is physical and emotional violence. The solution begins with the self. Self-acceptance and taking care of oneself. While it does sound banal, simple words are often difficult to put into practice. Being the main character in your own life often requires some tenacious knots to be untangled.\nAcceptance and caring can never be compensated for by anyone from the outside – neither one's colleagues, boss, partner or the government can put a patch of recognition on the void we see when we look within ourselves. It can be done by making peace with oneself that will in turn lead to taking responsibility for one's actions and words. And taking emotional responsibility as an adult helps keep fear at bay.\nWe are not so weak and immature as a society as to only need heroes we can celebrate and applaud, heroes we can relate to in order to maintain our identity. Heroes whose posters to stick on our walls so we could imagine what it would be like to be in their shoes. This is where we need to be ourselves. Unique and useful, acting as the heroes of our own lives. Every difficult situation, crisis or disaster can be overcome then.\nHowever, I'm afraid this particular crisis will last far longer than we might imagine. Sailing through it, we will see crisis management and post-crisis management. Once the tsunami has passed and we're left with just stormy seas and rock-strewn beaches, the latter will be felt painfully under our bare feet for a long time still.\nThe thing to ponder is how to get society back on track and keep things going in the abeyance that will follow weeks of stress. Will people tired of having to reorganize their work overnight and living in the conditions of nonstop coronavirus news be able to continue at full steam? If so, then how and at what cost?\nAnswering this question will likely require more effort than replacing tired employees with new blood of which there should be plenty available in the wake of layoffs and bankruptcies. Until the next crisis.\nWhat will happen if we'll see a new virus decimate the global economy again in just a few weeks next year? The current experiment where governments all over the world are trying to bring under control that which is not meant to be controlled is an interesting spectacle in itself. Unfortunately, it is also one of the more tragic ones of our time. Economically paralyzing and socially ruinous.\nHowever, there is something gaining control over which is far easier and depends on every one of us. It is fear. The greater our responsibility – for our health, immune system, way of life and loved ones, the less power fear has and the less painful the crisis will be in the end.\nThe coronavirus will cause the greatest change in society that we have seen in the past decades. As ever, those capable of adjusting to change will survive. The heroes and crowned heads of our time are those who in addition to adjusting to change can also manage and mold it. This requires one to conquer one's fears and take responsibility. And that is something everyone can do.\n--\nDownload the ERR News app for Android and iOS now and never miss an update!\nEditor: Marcus Turovski"}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-updates-who-upgrades-global-virus-spread-risk-to-very-high/a-52566672", "title": "Coronavirus updates : WHO upgrades global virus spread risk to ′ very high ′ | News | DW", "text": "Stock markets around the world have plunged amid mounting concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 virus on business.

", "text": "How will Australia respond if the coronavirus outbreak becomes a pandemic?\nExperts say it’s time to start using the ‘p-word’, and people with medical conditions should ‘get ahead’ on their prescriptions\n- Coronavirus live blog: latest news and updates\n- What does it mean if coronavirus is declared a pandemic?\nAs cases of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus rise outside of China health experts in Australia argue a global coronavirus pandemic “is very likely, if not inevitable”.\nSome say the world is already in the early stages of a pandemic, which is defined by the World Health Organisation as a disease spreading across two continents.\nClusters of Covid-19 – the illness caused by the novel coronavirus (officially known as Sars-CoV-2) – are emerging all over the world, with some showing no obvious link to China, leaving experts struggling to determine where they started and how they have spread.\nGlobally, there have been 78,973 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 2,466 deaths. The vast majority of infections and deaths have been in mainland China, centred around central Hubei province.\nHow does a country like Australia, geographically remote and with a limited number of mild cases – all of which have been traced back to their origin – counter a pandemic?\nEarly stages: health screenings and travel bans\nUnder the Australian government’s Emergency Response Plan for Covid-19, the “initial action” response when cases are first identified in Australia is focused on “minimising transmission” and “managing initial cases”. It involves border measures such as health screenings at airports and ports, escalating to travel bans, which are currently in place for travellers from mainland China.\nConfirmed cases are tracked backwards to find points of infection, and potential contacts – such as fellow passengers on flights – alerted to the potential that they have been exposed to the disease.\nThose who have been exposed to suspected cases are asked to self-isolate at home. Citizens and permanent residents returning from known hotspots face periods of enforced quarantine.\nEscalation: surge staffing and ‘fever clinics’\nIf, and as, cases escalate, hospitals can be advised to consider bringing in additional “surge staff” and state governments asked to consider establishing “fever clinics” or other alternative models of care “to minimise the burden on the health system”.\nPlaces where outbreaks could spread especially rapidly, or could impact upon vulnerable populations – residential aged care facilities, schools and prisons – can be given extra support and staff to investigate and manage outbreaks.\nAustralia’s Covid-19 plan draws from the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza, which contemplates a novel coronavirus from which the Australian population would have little immunity.\n“Currently, there are no effective anti-virals available and there is no vaccine. Availability of a customised novel coronavirus vaccine would be the greatest tool in reducing the impact. It is still not known if or when this might be available,” the emergency response plan reads, noting that there is still no vaccine available for the other major coronaviruses Sars and Mers.\nIncreasing ‘social distancing’ measures\nGovernment-directed social distancing measures may increase from reactively – or, if necessary, preemptively – closing schools if it appears children are particularly susceptible; encouraging, or potentially mandating, workplace closures and working from home; and cancelling large public events.\nAnd Australia will also attempt to insulate itself from any growing pandemic with increasing travel advisories for countries that are experiencing significant outbreaks.\nAlready, the Department of Foreign Affairs has raised the travel advisory for China to the highest level: “Do Not Travel”, and told its citizens already in the country they should leave the country as soon as they are able.\nOn Monday, the Australian government raised its travel advice for both South Korea and Japan.\n“Based on advice from Australia’s chief medical officer, we now recommend you ‘exercise a high degree of caution’... due to a heightened risk of sustained local transmission of coronavirus (Covid-19),” Dfat said of both countries.\nWhat individuals can do\nRisk communication experts Jody Lanard and Peter Sandman have argued that with the rise in cases globally, “it’s a good time to think about how to use the ‘P-word’ (pandemic) in talking about Covid-19”.\n“The most crucial (and overdue) risk communication task for the next few days is to help people visualise their communities when ‘keeping it out’ – containment – is no longer relevant. The P word is a good way to launch this message.”\nLanard and Sandman say there are measures individuals can take to prepare for and deal with a potential global outbreak.\nThey advise people with medical conditions to “get ahead” on prescriptions if possible “in case of very predictable supply chain disruptions, and so they won’t have to go out to the pharmacy at a time when there may be long lines of sick people”.\nLanard and Sandman also recommend people slowly starting to stock up on non-perishable food “to last their households through several weeks of social distancing at home during an intense wave of transmission in their community”.\n“And the example we like the best, because it gives every single person an immediate action that they can take over and over: right now, today, start practicing not touching your face when you are out and about!\n“You probably won’t be able to do it perfectly, but you can greatly reduce the frequency of potential self-inoculation. You can even institute a buddy system, where friends and colleagues are asked to remind each other when someone scratches her eyelid or rubs his nose.”\nPreparing for a pandemic\nThe government’s emergency response plan says Australia is well placed globally to respond to any widespread outbreak, but that the risks should not be under-estimated.\n“The novel coronavirus outbreak represents a significant risk to Australia. It has the potential to cause high levels of morbidity and mortality and to disrupt our community socially and economically.”\nThis month, the Australian government updated its Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19). The plan outlines a staged response to a worsening pandemic: Australia is currently in the “initial action” stage.\nThe emergency response plans says impact of the outbreak will be determined by:\nthe clinical severity of the outbreak (how severe cases are, and many people need to be hospitalised)\nits transmissibility (how easily it is spread, currently it has a preliminary reproduction number of 1.4 to 2.5)\nthe capacity of the health system to treat infected patients\nthe effectiveness of interventions to treat the illness or stop it spreading\nVictoria’s chief health minister, Dr Brett Sutton, said all Australian states, along with the commonwealth government, have been working on pandemic preparedness for weeks.\n“It’s clear that with local transmission in several countries a pandemic is very likely, if not inevitable. We are working rapidly on planning and surge with our health sector.\n“We’ve provided guidance to practitioners and many communications materials but are now focused on the models of care that will need to be in place – clinics, phone triage, home care, right through to ICU and aged care.”\n“Victoria and Australia nonetheless remain completely in containment mode,” Sutton said, “identifying any possible case; isolating those who are infectious; and quarantining contacts. Regardless of developments internationally, this gives all of us time and space to plan and prepare.”"}, {"url": "https://time.com/5791472/cruise-ship-sailing-for-mexico-after-being-denied-entry-in-jamaica-and-grand-cayman-over-coronavirus-fears/", "title": "Cruise Ship Sailing for Mexico After Being Denied Entry Over Coronavirus Fears", "text": "A ship operated by MSC Cruises is sailing for Cozumel, Mexico, Wednesday after authorities in two Caribbean ports effectively refused to let passengers disembark over coronavirus fears.\nThe company said it has received “formal and final authorization” to call in Cozumel, despite an earlier report to the contrary, and expects to arrive Wednesday evening local time.\nOn Tuesday, Jamaican authorities delayed a disembarkation decision on the MSC Meraviglia for “many hours,” according to a previous statement from the company.

Residents are placed according to whether they have tested positive for COVID-19, or have been in close contact with an infected person, or have not been in close contact with an infected person, and have tested negative for COVID-19.\nPeople who have tested positive for COVID-19 must remain in strict isolation until recovery.\nPeople who have been in close contact with the infected persons and who have tested negative for COVID-19 will need to stay at their apartments in the halls of residence for two weeks, and monitor their health status. They will have the opportunity to go outside for fresh air.\nResidents who have not been in contact with infected persons, and who have tested negative for COVID-19 are allowed to move about freely, taking into account the general movement restrictions due to the emergency situation.\nThe Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) will monitor the observance of restrictions of movement at Raatuse 22.\nThe person in charge of the emergency situation, Mr Jüri Ratas issued an order based on the proposal of the leader of the South region for emergency situation Mr Margo Klaos; having consulted the rector of the University of Tartu Mr Toomas Asser, the Mayor of Tartu Mr Urmas Klaas, Chancellor of Justice Mrs Ülle Madise, and Professor Irja Lutsar of Tartu University.\nYesterday, a foreign student of University of Tartu residing at the University´s halls of residence, tested positive for COVID-19. Additional testing was carried out on 17 people who had been in close contact with the infected person, and 5 of them tested positive for COVID-19. The infected persons live in the same halls of residence and participated at a birthday party organised at the residence.\nThe order shall enter into force upon signature. The restrictions are valid until the amendment of the order and will be re-evaluated every two weeks.\nMessage from University of Tartu rector\nOn Friday the University of Tartu posted a video on Facebook of a message from Rector Toomas Asser.

Those who are well, he added, have nothing to gain from going around in a face mask.\nAK anchor Astrid Kannel: I understand that people in Estonia have begun buying up masks and all kinds of cleaning products. Is there any point to wearing a face mask?\nMait Altmets: There is a point if you are experiencing symptoms. It isn't the most reasonable thing to just walk around wearing a mask. People often don't know how to use the mask — they pull it under their chin and wear it under their nose, at which point it is entirely pointless, and we're wasting this valuable mask that otherwise might be needed somewhere else later.\nAK: Who should really be wearing a face mask, someone who is sick or someone afraid of being infected?\nMA: It should be worn by someone experiencing symptoms, regardless of whether it is coronavirus, the flu or whatever other virus. If you are experiencing symptoms — cough, cold — then you should wear a mask to protect those around you if you need to go out somewhere.\nAK: How much should one really be washing their hands?\nMA: When coming here, I asked my children what the best means of preventing coronavirus is. They said coughing into your sleeve and washing your hands. You should wash your hands when they have been contaminated by respiratory fluids, for example, such as after coughing into your hands. And it really is better to cough into your sleeve if you don't have tissues handy and can't wash your hands right away.\nAK: How much can one irritate the skin on their hands with constant hand-washing and cleaning with various products?\nMA: People in hospitals use them every day, and 20-30 times per day, and we are completely capable of working. If using them more often, then special alcohol-based antiseptics have hand care products built in, and they are friendlier than soap and water, which dry skin out.\nAK: How should one be regarding and reacting to all of this in general right now?\nMA: You should live as you do during other viral seasons. If you are experiencing symptoms, stay home, don't spread it and keep a distance socially. If you need to communicate, do so by phone. And consider avoiding visits. And you should only visit loved ones in the hospital if you are well.\nAK: Have you yourself also changed any of your behaviors in this panic caused by the coronavirus?\nMA: I have not.\n-\nCommonly referred to as the novel coronavirus, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

From there the pathogens can be expelled from the body faster than from the lungs, for example by sneezing, coughing or blowing. In this way SARS-CoV-2 spreads onto surfaces where it comes into contact with mucous membranes and infects others by smear infection via the hands.\nWhat concrete measures can individuals undertake to protect themselves and others from a droplet infection?\n- Keep a distance of one to two meters from anyone who is infected.\n- Wash your hands regularly and carefully (at least 20 seconds with soap, including the wrists).\n- Avoid shaking hands and hugging people\n- Develop self-protection reflexes: Press elevator buttons with your knuckle instead of your fingertip.\n- Avoid busy places and events. Set priorities.\n- Avoid touching your own face or the faces of friends and relatives.\n- Do not touch the mucous membranes of your mouth, eyes and nose with your fingers.\n- Put on gloves if necessary. Wash or change them daily.\n- Do not sneeze in your hand. Use your elbow or a tissue instead.\n- Dispose of used tissues quickly.\nIf possible, avoid busy places and events and wash your hands!\nBreathing masks offer little protection to healthy people. When worn, the masks become moist through air intake. After just 20 minutes their protective barrier deteriorates. Masks should be reserved for medical staff.\nHow can I prepare for a pandemic?\nIf it comes to an intense wave of infections, restrictions on movement will most likely be imposed and this could lead to supply bottlenecks. Take precautions so that you can stay at home for several weeks if necessary.\n- Have important prescription medication (if necessary) ready for a month.\n- Keep a supply of non-perishable food.\n- Make arrangements for how to protect your friends and family. The elderly and sick with weak immune systems are particularly at risk and dependent on help.\n- Organize possibilities for caring for sick children.\n- Make arrangements for caring for sick family members without infecting yourself.\nHow can I help the community?\nThe more people make efforts to prepare, the more the feeling of togetherness increases. You can improve the situation by helping communities to organize help for themselves.\nAfter surviving the COVID-19 disease you are immune to the pathogen. Therefore, you can leave your home and volunteer to take over other errands and do some shopping for those who are still sick and infectious.\nIf not already in place, employers should work out possibilities for home office and teleworking\nWhat can employers do?\nWhen a highly infectious virus spreads, businesses need to take precautions to protect their employees. Sick or at-risk employees should stay at home. Whenever possible, employers should offer possibilities for home office or teleworking.\n- Employees with acute symptoms of respiratory illness (for example, coughing or shortness of breath) or those who become ill during the day should be separated from other employees immediately and sent home.\n- Companies should provide fresh air at workplaces and in social rooms, and replace filters in ventilation systems.\n- They should provide facilities for hygiene with clean water, soap and paper towels. In the office, cleaning wipes and sprays to disenfect keyboards and telephones should be made available and regularly used.\n- All work surfaces and the surrounding area should be routinely cleaned.\n- Employees who are healthy but have a sick family member with COVID-19 at home should notify their supervisor.\n- Supervisors should identify particularly relevant positions in the work processes and arrange for substitutes. This way the absence of one person will then not endanger or affect the functioning of the whole organization.\nWhat about business and leisure travel?\nDuring a pandemic, travel plans should be regularly reviewed. Employers and employees need to study the latest guidelines and recommendations for each destination. Companies should advise their employees to have themselves examined for symptoms of acute respiratory illness before travel and to stay home if they become ill.\n-\nMyths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web?\nDoes rinsing your nose with saline protect you?\nAccording to the World Health Organization, there is no evidence to support claims that a saline solution will \"kill” the virus and protect you.\n-\nMyths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web?\nWill gargling mouthwash prevent an infection?\nCertain brands of mouthwash may eliminate particular microbes from your saliva for a few minutes, but, according to the WHO, this does not protect you from the new coronavirus.\n-\nMyths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web?\nCan eating garlic help?\nThis dubious claim has been spreading like wildfire across social media. Though it is possible that garlic may have some antimicrobial properties, there is no evidence to suggest from the current coronavirus outbreak that eating this bulb will protect people from the virus.\n-\nMyths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web?\nCan pets spread COVID-19?\nThere is no evidence to suggest pets, such as cats and dogs, can be infected or transmit the coronavirus. Regularly washing your hands with soap and water after touching your beloved moggy or pooch will help stop the spread of bacteria that they commonly carry, such as E. coli and salmonella.\n-\nMyths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web?\nCan the corona virus be transmitted via air mail?\nPeople receiving parcels from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus, as the virus does not survive long on objects. Due to the poor survivability of the coronavirus on surfaces, there is a very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks.\n-\nMyths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web?\nIs there a vaccine yet?\nThe new coronavirus needs its own vaccine. Pneumonia vaccines such as the pneumococcal and the Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine will not protect you against the coronavirus.\n-\nMyths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web?\nDo bleach products protect you?\nBleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, solvents, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform can kill the 2019-nCoV on hard surfaces; however, they have little or no impact if you put them on your skin.\n-\nMyths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web?\nAvoid direct contact!\nTo avoid a coronavirus infection, always cook raw foods thoroughly. It is also advisable to avoid direct contact with people who are sick.\n-\nMyths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web?\nKeep your hands clean!\nFrequently washing your hands with soap and water can help prevent an infection. You can also use an alcohol-based sanitizing gel instead. If you have to cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow. If you have contracted the disease without knowing it, coughing or sneezing in this manner might help to reduce the spread.\nAuthor: Jessie Wingard"}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/german-manufacturing-orders-up-but-industry-wracked-by-china-corona-jitters/av-52667603", "title": "German manufacturing orders up , but industry wracked by China Corona jitters | Business| Economy and finance news from a German perspective | DW", "text": "China was Germany's most important trading partner for the fourth year in a row in 2019 – a faltering Chinese economy would have significant knock-on effects for Germany"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-symptoms-start-about-five-days-after-infection-new-research-finds-11583784452", "title": "Coronavirus Symptoms Start About Five Days After Infection , New Research Finds", "text": "- U.S.\nCoronavirus Symptoms Start About Five Days After Infection, New Research Finds\nIncubation period supports recommendations of a two-week quarantine, according to a Johns Hopkins University study\nMost people who catch Covid-19—the disease caused by the novel coronavirus—start showing symptoms roughly five days after infection, disease analysts at Johns Hopkins University said on Monday, in the largest such study of known cases world-wide.\nTheir findings firm up estimates of the virus’s incubation period before signs of fever, coughing and respiratory distress appear, offering support for current public-health control measures that recommend a 14-day monitoring and quarantine period for people who have been exposed...\n- DoorDash:\n$15 off $30 order with DoorDash promo code\n- TurboTax:\nTurboTax service code and discount: $5 off for Deluxe Version\n- Kohl's:\n15% off $100+ with Kohl's coupon\n- Walmart:\nWalmart promo: Mother's Day gifts are now up to 80% OFF\n- eBay:\nTop eBay coupon: $250 off $1000+ watches\n- Saks Fifth Avenue:\nSaks Fifth Avenue coupon - 10% off Frozen 2 Doll set\nMost Popular Videos\nKim Jong Un Re-Emerges, Strolling and Smoking\nCruise Ship Partied On as Coronavirus Spread\nCoronavirus Update: Lockdown Orders Expire, Lab Theory Investigated\nAs Ferrari Reopens, Staff Are Greeted With Coronavirus Blood Tests\nWhat China’s Pollution Tells Us About Coronavirus and the Economy\nMost Popular Articles\nWhy Home Prices Are Rising During the Pandemic\nSmart or Lucky?

In one case, the test centre at Chessington in south-west London, which is being run by the consultancy Deloitte, was unable to ring through with a diagnosis because it hadn’t recorded correct phone numbers. The government says millions of key workers and their families in England could start to book tests online from today as it continues to try to reach its target of 100,000 daily tests by the end of April. A leaked email from Public Health England says there are still not enough tests being done on care home residents. Less than a tenth of the controversial shipment from Turkey has arrived despite the UK’s downpayment, and the son of a hospital doctor who died from Covid-19 says his father had “to beg” for PPE and that his death was avoidable. Meanwhile, the New Zealand nurse who helped treat Boris Johnson has broken her silence to say she didn’t treat him any differently from any other patient.\nDoctors have criticised Donald Trump after he suggested people could be cured by having injections of disinfectant (“knocks it out in a minute… One minute!”). He also mooted the idea of treating patients with ultraviolet light. In a more conventional policy response, Trump warned that social distancing guidelines could remain in force until the summer, while we look at what extended isolation might mean in the UK.\nCases worldwide have risen to more than 2.7 million while the death toll is above 190,000, with nearly 50,000 of those in the US.

The report, leaked over the Easter weekend, said efforts to tackle the matter were hindered by opposition to former leader Jeremy Corbyn. But critics, some of whom are on the right of the party, say it was an attempt to smear whistleblowers. Starmer said disciplinary action could be brought against people named in the report who had broken the party’s rules.\nBack to Brexit – Just when you thought it might have gone away, Michel Barnier, the EU’s lead Brexit negotiator, will give an update today on how talks that resumed this week have progressed. The talks were postponed for six weeks due to the coronavirus and have restarted via video-conferencing. But there is frustration in Brussels that the UK is refusing to countenance an extension to the transition period despite the Covid-19 disruption.\nZoom boom – The growth in online meetings has prompted the newly popular platform Zoom to update its security protocols.

People in the industry started preparing for the fact that construction material from China might be delayed, for example.\nFinnish construction firm SRV, which is behind Tampere’s Uros Live arena and the Kansi tower projects, immediately started checking where to source materials that had previously come from China.\n“We’re constantly looking for alternative suppliers from Europe, and at least for now we have enough materials on our sites. Fortunately, cargo is still being transported,” says Henri Sulankivi, Area Director at SRV.\nStory continues after the photo.\nIn Tampere, two other major construction projects that are under way include the city’s tram line and the Sulkavuori wastewater treatment plant.\nAccording to Pekka Sirviö, CEO of Tampere Tramway, the project is just getting under way for this year so the effects of the coronavirus on tram line construction are not yet known.\n\"For the time being, we’ve been able to continue with our work as planned,\" Sirviö told Yle.\nAnd as for the Sulkavuori wastewater treatment plant, quarrying work has continued as normal, according to Ari-Matti Ilkka, project director at Sulkavuori, who also believes the project will be finished on time.\n“Even in a normal situation project risks are managed with a careful risk management plan, which will probably be of help to us in the upcoming weeks,” says Ilkka.\nPossible labour shortage\nMaterials running out aren’t the only concern as many construction projects use a lot of foreign labour. According to the Finnish Construction Trade Union, there are about 20,000-25,000 foreign construction workers working in Finland.\nParticularly in the capital region and southern Finland, the fear has been that work will stop when workers return to their home countries owing to the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe Finnish Border Guard’s instructions last week for Estonian workers was that they should not to return to Finland.\nThe Tampere Kansi project is being built by tens of foreign workers. According to SRV’s Henri Sulankivi, the worst scenario has been avoided as many subcontractors have been able to convince their workers to stay in Finland while projects are ongoing.\n\"Subcontractors have been very flexible in this situation, so far we’re managing,\" says Sulankivi.\nAccording to Markku Riihimäki, CEO of Forecon Oy, a Finnish consulting company specialised in construction markets, one of the biggest challenges will be if the workforce gets sick as the pandemic continues.\n\"Construction sites are slowing down and the epidemic may also halt whole sites or parts of sites if there’s a high incidence of illness,\" he says.\nRiihimäki also sees the consequences of a smaller foreign workforce.\n\"Some have already gone back home or may leave Finland during the crisis,\" he says, adding: \"Nevertheless, I believe that a large part of the foreign labour market will stay in Finland.\"\nConstruction continues, but for how long?\nSRV believes its projects the Uros Live arena and the Kansi tower will be completed on time, although there are many buts.\n\"Difficult times caused by the corona epidemic are still ahead of us.

Now there are signs that the virus is moving from traders’ screens to the real economy. No one will know the true economic impact for some time, because official statistics are published with a lag: the first estimate of GDP growth in the current quarter, for instance, will not appear until April 29th. Analysts cannot wait that long. So they are turning to “real-time” data, mainly produced by the private sector, on everything from transport use to social-media activity. None of these measures is reliable by itself, but together they give a decent impression of what is going on.\nIt is not all doom and gloom. So far there are few indications—either from weekly jobless claims or from company announcements—that joblessness is rising. Worries that broken supply chains would stoke inflation also look overdone, for now at least. Data to the beginning of March from State Street PriceStats Indicators, which measures inflation daily, suggest that inflation has been on a steady downward trend since the beginning of the year (though in recent days food prices have inched up, perhaps pointing to the effects of stockpiling). Railway and trucking volumes appear to be holding up. There is some evidence of lower electricity demand, perhaps as people miss work, though the figures are volatile.\nHousehold spending is taking a big hit, however. Analysis by Goldman Sachs, a bank, of Twitter posts suggests that consumer confidence has dropped. People are nervous of crowds—and some 40% of household spending is vulnerable to people shunning gatherings, according to calculations by The Economist using a methodology from an Oxford University research paper. (About 5% of consumer spending goes on dining out, for instance.)\nGoogle searches for “restaurant reservations” are way down. The maître d’ at San Francisco’s best oyster bar was so pleased to see a customer that he offered a free plate of them when your correspondent bought a drink (the bar looked over the bay towards Grand Princess, a virus-stricken ship harboured in Oakland). A report from JPMorgan Chase, another bank, estimates that last weekend the virus reduced cinema-ticket receipts by 20%. Attendance at Broadway shows has also dropped. Data from TomTom, a location-technology firm, reveal unusually low traffic congestion in many American cities since the end of last week. Lower consumer spending points to feeble GDP growth in the first half of this year, though a recession still seems unlikely at this stage.\nWhat happens next depends on whether America gets a handle on the outbreak. If it does not, then over time revenue-starved firms and salary-starved families will struggle. Any short-term economic boost from stockpiling would be cold comfort in the face of lower spending on services. But if America contains the virus, it can look forward to a bounceback of sorts. Real-time data in China, from traffic congestion to energy consumption, remain weak but are fast improving as the number of new infections slows.

The information for nursing homes remains incomplete, because not all of them have reported the number of people contaminated or dead because of COVID-19.\nHe also said that 28,143 people were currently hospitalized -- of which 6838 are in intensive care, accounting for a rise of 176 people in 24 hours in intensive care.\nAmong the critical patients 35% are under 60 years old.\n“The number of people being cured is also increasing very quickly,” Salomon said.\n___\nWASHINGTON — The White House says President Donald Trump spoke with commissioners of the country’s sports leagues on Saturday and told them he recognizes “the good work being done by many teams and players” to care for their communities and fan bases dealing with the new coronavirus.\nThe virus has decimated the sports world with the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League suspending their seasons indefinitely and Major League Baseball and the WNBA postponing the start of their season.\nThe NCAA basketball tournament was also cancelled, as were college spring sports such as baseball and softball, lacrosse and track and field.\nThe White House says the commissioners thanked Trump for his “national leadership and for his interest in the sports industry.” He called on them to continue efforts to support their fellow Americans during the current challenge.\nA wide range of sports league officials participated in the call, including Roger Goodell, commissioner of the National Football League, and Adam Silver, commissioner of the NBA.\n___\nLONDON — Carrie Symonds, fiancee of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, says she is “on the mend” after a week suffering from symptoms of COVID-19.\nSymonds, 32, tweeted: “I’ve spent the past week in bed with the main symptoms of Coronavirus,” though she had not been tested.\nSymonds, who is pregnant, is not currently staying with Johnson at the prime minister’s Downing St. residence.\nShe said in a tweet that “being pregnant with Covid-19 is obviously worrying” but she was reassured by the latest medical guidance.\nThe Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says babies are unlikely to be exposed to COVID-19 during pregnancy and there is also no data at the moment suggesting an increased risk of miscarriage for pregnant women.\nJohnson tested positive for the virus on March 26 and remains quarantined in Downing St. He said Friday he is feeling better but still has a fever.\n___\nISTANBUL — Turkey’s health minister reported 76 new COVID-19 deaths in the past 24 hours, raising the death toll in the country to 501.\nFahrettin Koca also raised the total number of COVID-19 infections to 23,934, reporting 3,013 more confirmed cases on Saturday. There are 1,311 patients in intensive care units across the country, with 909 of them intubated.\nA total of 786 people have recovered from novel coronavirus infections, according to the figures the health minister posted on Twitter.\n___\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The suspected mismanagement of essential supplies during Hurricane Maria has turned out to be a boon for Puerto Rico as it fights a rise in the coronavirus cases. Health Secretary Lorenzo González said Saturday that officials discovered a cache of urgently needed personal protective equipment at a hospital in the nearby island of Vieques that remains closed since the Category 4 storm hit in September 2017. He said the equipment includes face masks, gloves, gowns and face shields that were in good condition. Puerto Rico has reported 18 deaths, including that of a nurse, and more than 450 confirmed cases, including police officers who have demanded more personal protective equipment.\n___\nROME — Italy’s virus-ravaged Lombardy region is now requiring residents to wear a protective mask when they go outside in a bid to further trim infections.\nThe ordinance from Lombardy Gov. Attilio Fontana goes into effect Sunday and lasts through April 13. It mirrors similar ordinances in recent days from two other northern regions, hard-hit Veneto and Alto Adige, which require protective masks for residents particularly if shopping in stores and markets.\nWhile all of Italy is under a nationwide lockdown, Lombardy has passed particularly tight restrictions on movement and business operations in an effort to curb infections in the epicenter of Europe’s outbreak. The new ordinance extends those tight restrictions to mid-April but makes a new exception to the shutdown for stationary stores to reopen to let students buy school supplies.\n___\nSKOPJE, North Macedonia — There were five deaths from the COVID-19 virus in North Macedonia in the past 24 hours, the highest single day toll so far, bringing the total to 17. There were 53 new confirmed cases, raising the total to 483. 20 people have recovered. Medical staff are also being infected. The country is in lock down, with closed borders, playgrounds, schools and all sports and other public events banned. A curfew from 4 pm till 5 am is in effect during weekends.\n___\nWASHINGTON — The District of Columbia has announced 145 new positive infections from the COVID-19 coronavirus, bringing the total up to 902, with six new deaths bringing the total to 15. Mayor Muriel Bowser has issued a stay-home order for Washington’s approximately 700,000 residents. Neighboring Maryland and Virginia have done the same. Bowser has declared a state of emergency, shuttered all schools and ordered all non-essential businesses to close. White House and Capitol tours have been cancelled and the National Zoo, Smithsonian museum network and Kennedy Center have closed.\n____\nROME — Italy is seeing more relief from the coronavirus outbreak in its jammed intensive care units, with 74 fewer beds in use over the past day nationwide.\nCivil protection chief Angelo Borrelli said the dip in ICU saturation was “important news because it allows our hospitals to breathe.” Intensive care wards in Lombardy, the epicenter of the European outbreak, have been full for weeks but on Saturday there were 56 fewer beds in use than the day before.\nOverall, new infections continued to slow their once-exponential pace, with 4,805 new cases registered Saturday that brought Italy’s official count to 124,632. The death toll continued to mount, with 681 new victims bringing the world’s highest toll to 15,362.\nItalian officials have urged Italians to continue rigorously observing the west’s first and most comprehensive national shutdown after some Italians were seen out walking and shopping in great numbers in various cities. Officials say the emergency is still very much under way, and that the infection curve remains at a plateau, not yet beginning its hoped-for decline.\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/who-no-proof-recovered-covid-19-patients-immune-f3a2b651-1842-4b59-80fb-1cba28bfba5e.html", "title": "WHO : No evidence recovered coronavirus patients COVID - 19 immune", "text": "WHO warns against coronavirus \"immunity passports\"\nA testing lab wear in Leonardtown, Maryland.

The ban forced the cancellation of next week’s Geneva international motor show – a major fixture on the global car industry calendar.\nThe Nigerian case is just the third to be confirmed in Africa, something that has puzzled health specialists given the continent’s close ties to China.\nAccording to Nigerian officials, the Italian man stayed in a hotel near the airport on the evening of 24 February, then continued to his place of work in neighbouring Ogun state. He was treated on 26 February at his company’s medical facility before health practitioners there called government biosecurity officers, who transferred him on 27 February to a containment facility in Yaba, Lagos. He was clinically stable with no serious symptoms, authorities said.\nThis month the World Health Organization warned that porous borders, a continuing flow of travellers and poorly resourced healthcare systems meant the risk of an outbreak across Africa was “very, very high” and raised significant concerns about the ability of “fragile health systems” to cope.\nIn recent weeks testing regimes and isolation facilities have been reinforced and there has been work on public messaging.\n“Nigeria has dramatically improved its ability to manage the outbreak of a major pandemic since the Ebola scare in west Africa in 2014,” Folasade Ogunsola, the professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Lagos, wrote on the Conversation website. “Any of the lessons from keeping the country free of Ebola have informed the steps taken since the news of the coronavirus epidemic first broke.”\nThere is anxiety in many countries, despite reinforced protective measures.

The Dow Jones had its biggest one-day fall on Thursday, plunging 1,190 points, or 4.4%, with analysts warning the virus could cause as much damage as the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Shares followed suit in the Asian trading session on Friday, while Brent crude was poised to dip below $50 a barrel for the first time in four years.\nDonald Trump was upbeat about the virus for a second day, saying on Thursday night that US agencies were doing a “fine job” and in the US and China, cases of Covid-19 were going down.\nBut where the Dow led, Asian markets followed, with markets in Australia, China, Japan and South Korea all posting heavy losses.\nJapan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, pledged to protect the economy, as the Japanese island of Hokkaido declared a state of emergency and urged all residents to stay home this weekend.\nNigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with 190 million people and numerous air links around the continent and beyond.\n“Given these recent developments globally and in Africa, it is not unlikely that we will have importation of Covid-19 to South Africa,” that country’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases said on Friday.\nSeparately, South Africa said two citizens who had been working on the Princess Diamond cruise ship had the virus and would remain in Japan for treatment.\nSouth Africa plans to evacuate more than 130 citizens from Wuhan city in China, where the outbreak began.

As the world stands today on the edge of the pandemic precipice, it’s worth taking a moment to consider whether Covid-19 is the disease our group was warning about.\nDisease X, we said back then, would likely result from a virus originating in animals and would emerge somewhere on the planet where economic development drives people and wildlife together. Disease X would probably be confused with other diseases early in the outbreak and would spread quickly and silently; exploiting networks of human travel and trade, it would reach multiple countries and thwart containment. Disease X would have a mortality rate higher than a seasonal flu but would spread as easily as the flu. It would shake financial markets even before it achieved pandemic status.\nIn a nutshell, Covid-19 is Disease X.\nEven as there are signs that the epidemic’s spread might be slowing in China, multiple communities and countries have now reported sustained transmission in their midst. The number of confirmed cases has exploded in South Korea in recent days. In Italy, villages and towns are on lockdown, Fashion Week in Milan has been disrupted and festivals are being canceled while public health authorities search for patient zero to identify who else is likely infected and may spread the disease in Europe. Iran appears to have become a new hub of transmission. The looming pandemic will challenge us in new ways, as people try to evade quarantines, and misinformation campaigns and conspiracy theorists ply their trade in open democracies.\nBut as the world struggles to respond to Covid-19, we risk missing the really big picture: Pandemics are on the rise, and we need to contain the process that drives them, not just the individual diseases.\nPlagues are not only part of our culture; they are caused by it. The Black Death spread into Europe in the mid-14th century with the growth of trade along the Silk Road. New strains of influenza have emerged from livestock farming. Ebola, SARS, MERS and now Covid-19 have been linked to wildlife. Pandemics usually begin as viruses in animals that jump to people when we make contact with them.\nThese spillovers are increasing exponentially as our ecological footprint brings us closer to wildlife in remote areas and the wildlife trade brings these animals into urban centers. Unprecedented road-building, deforestation, land clearing and agricultural development, as well as globalized travel and trade, make us supremely susceptible to pathogens like coronaviruses.\nYet the world’s strategy for dealing with pandemics is woefully inadequate. Across the board, from politicians to the public, we treat pandemics as a disaster-response issue: We wait for them to happen and hope a vaccine or drug can be developed quickly in their aftermath. But even as Covid-19 rages, there still is no vaccine available for the SARS virus of 2002-3, nor for HIV/AIDS or Zika or a host of emerging pathogens. The problem is that between outbreaks, the will to spend money on prevention wanes, and the market for vaccines and drugs against sporadic viral diseases isn’t enough to drive research and development.\nDuring its World Health Assembly in 2016, the W.H.O. set up the R&D Blueprint to bridge this gap and announced a priority list of pathogens that most threaten global health and for which no vaccines or drugs were in the pipeline. SARS made the list, as did MERS, Nipah, Ebola and other rare but serious diseases caused by epidemic viruses. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations — a global partnership between public, private, philanthropic and civil society organizations launched at Davos in 2017 — stepped up to the plate and sourced funding to develop vaccines and therapeutics against some of these.\nTo escape from the Age of Pandemics, we’ll need to treat them as a public health issue and start working on prevention in addition to responses. Our first goal should be to broaden our armory against potential mass epidemics. When some of us added “Disease X” to the W.H.O.’s priority list two years ago, we wanted to make the point that it’s not sufficient to develop vaccines and drugs for known agents when the next big one is likely to be a different pathogen — a virus close to SARS, say, but not close enough that the same vaccine can work against both.\nAs Covid-19 strikes today and a spate of other pathogens are ready to emerge in the future, we continue to butt up against nature. Scientists estimate that there are 1.67 million unknown viruses of the type that have previously emerged in people. Discovering and sequencing them should be a priority — a simple case of “know your enemy.” In the aftermath of SARS, research on coronaviruses originating in bats has discovered more than 50 related viruses, some of which have the potential to infect people; this information can now be used to test for broad-action vaccines and drugs. Scaling up this effort to cover all viral families, as the Global Virome Project proposes to do, is a logical first step toward prevention.\nA radical shift is also needed in the way that tests, vaccines and drugs are designed so that entire groups of pathogens are targeted instead of individual pathogens that are already known. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States is working on a universal flu vaccine that would cover all known strains of influenza; a universal coronavirus vaccine, an Ebola-virus vaccine and others will also be needed.\nWith a smaller investment, we can also try to get ahead of pandemics by working with communities in hot spots of emerging diseases. Disease surveillance should be focused on farmers, rural communities and anyone who has extensive contact with wildlife, to look for unusual illnesses, test for novel pathogens and work with people to develop alternatives to high-risk activities such as the wildlife trade.\nPandemics are like terrorist attacks: We know roughly where they originate and what’s responsible for them, but we don’t know exactly when the next one will happen. They need to be handled the same way — by identifying all possible sources and dismantling those before the next pandemic strikes.\nPeter Daszak is a disease ecologist and the president of EcoHealth Alliance, in New York.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/africa-has-been-spared-so-far-from-coronavirus-why/a-52382666", "title": "Africa has been spared so far from coronavirus .

Now 16 African labs can run the tests.\nThis situation has changed. Medical teams from more than a dozen African countries met in Senegal last week to learn how the diagnose the new virus. Now 19 African nations are able to test for COVID-19, including Nigeria, Gabon, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, Zambia and Sierra Leone, WHO Africa clarified in an email.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has also identified 13 priority countries in Africa with strong links to China and told DW it has dispatched experts to eight of these to help coordinate preparedness efforts.\nThe priority countries have all introduced screenings at airports, as well as some seaports, according to the WHO.\nIn Sierra Leone, more than 30 Chinese who arrived from China last week are under quarantine in Freetown.\n\"Anyone from China, whether a Chinese diplomat, a Sierra Leonean or Nigerian, as long as your passport shows you left China within past 14 days — as soon as you enter any of our border crossing points, we would detain and put you in quarantine, said Dr. Mohamed Alex Vandy, Sierra Leone's Director of Health Security Emergency Management.\n\"Not because you are sick or committed any crime, but as a preventive measure to keep the population safe.\"\nWith screening on the rise and testing capabilities in place, now perhaps we will see a difference in terms of detecting cases, disease researcher Isaac Ngere told DW.\n'Pure chance'\nPaul Hunter, a UK-based specialist in infectious diseases and epidemics, largely puts the absence of COVID-19 on the continent down to luck.\n\"If you look at how COVID-19 has spread to non-Chinese countries, most of the spread has been pretty much due to the general intensity of travel around the world,\" he told DW.\n\"There is nothing special about Africa not having seen a case other than pure chance at the moment.\"\nToo warm for COVID-19?\nAnother theory is that the continent is too warm for the COVID-19 virus to thrive.\nCoronaviruses, which include some of the viruses responsible for the common cold and flu, can show something called seasonality — that is, they peak and wane depending on the season.\nMany cold and flu viruses peak in winter, for example; the droplets sneezed and coughed out by people spread more easily in winter's cold dry air and when people are crowded inside together.\nThey then die down in warmer weather.\n\"When the season is warmer and more humid, the droplets transmitting the [flu virus] tend to fall out of the air more quickly, therefore limiting its transmission,\" explained Yap Boum, the Africa representative for Epicentre, the research arm of Doctors without Borders (MSF).\nTropical countries aren't immune from seasonality, with flu peaking in the dry season in countries like Cameroon, Boum told DW.\nHowever, not all coronaviruses spread through respiratory droplets and Boum cautions that it is too early to tell if COVID-19 is transmitted in a similar fashion.\n\"We have no background information ... so we can't yet tell,\" he said.\nHowever, he said, it still \"might be more prudent for countries like South Africa, which will start heading into winter, to follow how the winter will affect or not the transmission of the novel coronavirus.\"\n'Doubt a big outbreak in Africa'\nEpidemiologist Paul Hunter also emphasizes that the COVID-19 virus \"hasn't been around long enough\" to know if its transmission will be affected by a change in seasons.\nBut even if the coronavirus makes its way to Africa, Hunter doesn't believe the continent will be as hard hit as China.\nRead more: Africans in Wuhan: Homesick and fearful of coronavirus\n\"I doubt we will see a big outbreak in Africa,\" said Hunter, a medical professor at the University of East Anglia as well at Tshwane University of Technology in South Africa.\n\"Droplet diseases don't seem to be as big an issue in Africa,\" he said, adding that SARS, a respiratory disease that is also a coronavirus, spread through 26 countries in 2003 but failed to gain a hold in Africa. Influenza epidemics are also less intense on the continent, he pointed out.\nIn addition, in Africa people generally don't live crammed together in such densely populated areas and they also spend a lot more time out-of-doors in Africa than they do in northern countries.\n\"I think that mitigates against such a severe outbreak,\" Hunter told DW.\nNo evidence of African immunity\nThere have been rumors swirling on social media that African countries haven't seen a case of coronavirus yet because Africans are immune.\nDisease experts emphatically reject this idea.\n\"That is nonsense. There is no evidence what so ever. That is false news, false facts,\" said infectious disease specialist Paul Hunter.\nAs for Dr Ngere, he said rumors that Africans have a genetic immunity to the disease are \"entirely not true!\"\nClaudia Anthony in Freetown contributed to this report.\nThousands of African students live in Wuhan, the center of China's coronavirus outbreak.

Normally, they would be begging at traffic lights on Johannesburg’s streets, relying on handouts from motorists, pedestrians and shop owners.\nBut the lockdown, now in its fifth week, has changed that.\nPolice are preventing them from leaving their dilapidated building to beg on the empty streets and barren sidewalks.\nThe building houses about two dozen blind or otherwise disabled foreigners who rely on handouts to make enough for food and rent. With their children, they make up about 70 people. Many have entered South Africa illegally from Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi.\n“I really understand that the coronavirus is killing a lot of people. But at the same time, I’m locked inside my room,” said Mukanhairi. “So death is death, due to corona or due to hunger.”\nSouth Africa has the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Africa, with more than 4,360, including 86 deaths.\nThe country’s far-reaching restrictions have been in effect since March 27 and residents must stay home, except for visits to grocery stores, pharmacies and health facilities. The lockdown will be eased starting May 1, but this is unlikely to help the beggars, because people will still be required to stay home.\nFamilies of six to eight people are crammed into small rooms where they cook, eat and sleep. Under such conditions, social distancing is not possible. The building has a few taps for water, so regular hand-washing is also difficult.\nThe elderly and blind often just sit on their beds as their children play in the dimly lit and narrow hallways, where loose electric cords dangle from the ceiling.\nWithout any donations, they say they are uncertain about where they will get their next meals.\nLast week, South Africa announced an increase in social grants for the poor, elderly and disabled, but these immigrants are not eligible for that aid.\nAt the start of the lockdown, authorities swept the homeless from the streets and took them to a housing facility where food is provided. The beggars say they fled to their own building at the time to avoid being rounded up.\nThey are not alone in being uncertain about how getting adequate food. The U.N. World Food Program said this month that the number of people around the world with acute hunger could almost double this year because of the pandemic. At least 265 million people could face food insecurity by the end of this year, a jump of 130 million.\nRosewite Prikise, 41, lives with her four children in one of the small rooms, where all share a bed.\n“We have one week’s worth of food left,” she said. “So we cannot survive, especially us who are blind.

The ruling underlined the chaotic public health approaches being taken to stop the spread of the new coronavirus from China.\nAlla llyina was admitted to the hospital in the northern Russian city of St. Petersburg on Feb. 6 with a sore throat and was tested for the new virus because she had returned from China five days earlier. She broke out of the hospital the next day by disabling an electronic lock in her room after finding out she would have to spend 14 days in isolation instead of the 24 hours that doctors promised her.\nIn an Instagram post, Ilyina said doctors told her that she tested negative for the virus but still had to remain quarantined for two weeks. “Wild,” Ilyina wrote. “All three tests showed I was completely healthy, so why the hell the quarantine?”\nHer brazen departure apparently embarrassed Russian authorities. Several days later, Russia’s public health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor filed a lawsuit against her, asking the court to order compulsory hospitalization for her.\nThe virus, which emerged in central China in December, has infected more than 71,000 people, killing 1,770 patients in mainland China and five others elsewhere. China has instituted strict lockdown measures on over 60 million people in central Hubei province and other nations are taking their own measures — including mandatory 14-day quarantines — to make sure the virus does not get established on their territory.\nIlyina’s defense lawyer argued during the court hearing Monday that she didn’t pose any danger to people around her and noted that she was allowed into a courtroom packed with dozens of people, none of whom — including Russian health authorities — wore masks.\nShe had told the Fontanka newspaper that her isolation room was dire — no books, no shampoo, no Wi-Fi, a wastebasket that was never emptied, a door secured by an electronic lock. Frustrated, she figured out how to short-circuit the lock.\nHealth officials maintained that isolating Ilyina was a necessary measure to stop the virus from spreading, claiming it can be latent in a person for up to 24 days. The court sided with them and ordered her to return to the hospital and stay in isolation at least until Wednesday.\nThe lawsuit clearly aimed to discourage other people from following her lead. The St. Petersburg branch of Rospotrebnadzor did not respond to a request for comment on the effectiveness of the court ruling, given that Ilyina has already roamed free for almost 10 days after escaping.\nLast week, at least three other people in quarantine for possible coronavirus infection fled the same St. Petersburg hospital. Two of them have since returned while the third — a woman named Anna Rybakova, according to media reports — remains at large. Rospotrebnadzor has filed a lawsuit to bring Rybakova back to the hospital as well, and a hearing on that is scheduled for Wednesday.\nThe chief of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, announced Monday that health officials were looking into introducing “harsher responsibility” for patients who violated quarantine rules and “stricter quarantine protocols.”\nRussia has seen only two cases of the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus, two Chinese citizens who have been treated and released. Still, Russian authorities have taken vast measures to prevent its spread, including hospitalizing hundreds of people who returned from China as a precaution.\nRussia has also halted most air traffic to China, suspended all trains to China and North Korea and closed its land border with China and Mongolia. Moscow has also temporarily stopped issuing work visas to Chinese citizens and told Chinese students who had been studying in Russia not to return until March 1.\nQuarantine protocols vary across Russia. In some regions, health officials isolate Chinese citizens who have recently returned from China, and in others everyone who reports symptoms resembling new virus is subject to a 14-day quarantine.\nPrime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has also said that Russia may start deporting foreigners infected with the virus.\nRussian authorities, meanwhile, reported Monday that a Russian woman aboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan is the first Russian citizen to be diagnosed with COVID-19.\nThe woman will be transferred to a hospital and receive treatment, the Russian Embassy in Japan said in a Facebook post. It wasn’t immediately clear where that would be. She is one of 454 people who have been infected on that particular cruise ship.\n___\nRead all the AP stories about the coronavirus outbreak that emerged from China at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/04/24/congos-smugglers-keep-hustling-through-the-coronavirus-lockdown", "title": "Correspondent diary - Congo smugglers keep hustling through the coronavirus lockdown | Middle East and Africa", "text": "BY 10AM MOST of Mama Kavira’s customers are already drunk.

Thanks, perversely, to Congo’s abysmal road networks, the virus is spreading only slowly through the country. Ropey planes used to shuttle people between cities but now all the airports have closed.\nStill, in an effort to keep any infected people out of Goma, the provincial governor has sealed off the city. Only lorries carrying goods are supposed to come in and out. But after decades of corruption, policemen, most of whom are poorly paid, are more interested in taking bribes than enforcing rules. Similarly, most people are accustomed to flouting laws whenever it suits them.\nThe new checkpoints that have sprung up at the edges of Goma have done little to stop Mama Kavira from importing her illegal booze. In fact, she is bringing in twice as much as usual. She orders the brew in from nearby towns. For a fee, drivers who are making the journey anyway will carry a few bottles. Getting it in is easy, she says. It just costs a little extra, now that there are more policemen who need to be bribed.\nIn Kinshasa, meanwhile, hustlers are also profiting from the lockdown. Most cases of coronavirus have cropped up in the business district of Gombe, which has been quarantined (though some restrictions have lately been eased). Cars are not allowed on the roads without a permit, supposedly issued only to essential workers such as doctors, nurses and security guards. But passes have flooded the black market where they are going for $100 each. A forged photocopy costs only about $20, but these will end up being more expensive, explains a taxi driver: because they have no holograms, the police have to be paid off each time they see the fake.\nHowever, for some people who once profited from Congo’s lawlessness, the coronavirus has put a stop to business. Beatrice (not her real name) is a professional smuggler in Goma. She hides everything from sachets of tomato sauce to mobile phones, marijuana, skin cream and shampoo under the folds of her skirts and crosses the border from Goma into Rwanda.\nShe stuffs goods down her trouser legs and ties up the bottoms with torn off bits of fabric. Then she wraps a pagne (a sheet of colourful material) around her waist. Sometimes, she even hides sachets of cheap Ugandan gin in an old football and asks a child to kick it past the border police. Most officials already know her, though—she tends to slip them a little something so they do not search her too diligently. Her clients avoid import taxes and, in turn, give her a slice of whatever they save.\nBut since the Rwandan border closed on March 21st, it has been too risky to try and sneak through. Policemen might shoot you. Instead, Beatrice has started selling flour in Goma. She makes the equivalent of just $1.20 a day compared with the $8-9 she used to earn by smuggling. “Now, getting any money at all is a struggle,” she says, bouncing a gurgling baby on her knee. “We go to bed hungry. Everything has changed because of corona.”\nFood prices in Goma have also shot up because of the border closure. Beans, rice and foufou (pounded cassava roots) all cost nearly double what they did before. In a poor country where millions of people were already struggling to put food on the table, life has just got even tougher. Congo’s dire infrastructure may act as a barrier to disease but once it gets out, corruption—be it smuggling or fake driving permits— will make it harder to contain. Yet most of Congo’s poor have little choice but to keep hustling; the alternative is to go hungry."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/convicted-fraudster-says-coronavirus-payouts-will-be-next-ppi", "title": "Convicted fraudster says coronavirus payouts will be  next PPI  ", "text": "Convicted fraudster says coronavirus payouts will be 'next PPI'\nMarc Feldman is among those registering companies with names such as Coronavirus Compensation Ltd\n- Coronavirus – latest updates\n- See all our coronavirus coverage\nA convicted fraudster who says that payments from the coronavirus will be “the next PPI” is among those who have been registering companies with names like Coronavirus Compensation Ltd since the crisis has taken hold.\nIndividuals have been positioning themselves for the future by officially registering dozens of companies with variations of coronavirus, Covid and Covid-19 over the past several weeks.\nAmong them are Corona Virus Claims Ltd and Coronavirus Compensation Ltd, which were registered to an address in Leeds by Marc Feldman on 12 March, the day Boris Johnson described the coronavirus as the worst public health crisis for a generation.\nFeldman was sentenced to 30 months in jail in October 2016 for his role in a £10m smuggling tax fraud in which he and four other men met at roadside cafes and used free public wifi to hide their activities. The gang had created fake businesses, aliases and contact shipping companies to give the impression of trading in other goods.\nHe was handed a 12-month suspended prison sentence six years earlier after being convicted of a £159,000 fraud in which he and another man hid behind the facade of a registered company while persuading other firms to hand over stock in the pretence they would pay for it.\nFeldman, from Leeds, told the Guardian: “Looking forward I see the next big thing about a year down the road from now will be that coronavirus will be the new PPI.\n“For the people that have lost relatives, people who have been poorly and people who have lost businesses there will be some kind of claims system. I think it will be the new PPI and that is the reason I have registered the companies.”\nFeldman added that he didn’t intend to set up a coronavirus PPI style business but had registered the company name to sell it on: “My job is, shall we say, to make the companies linked to the events happening around us.”\nBuying and selling companies was his “attempt at doing straight business”, he added.\n“I am doing nothing wrong. I have been involved in criminal activity and I have been to prison. But I have paid my dues and fines.”\nMore than 500 coronavirus-related scams and over 2,000 phishing attempts by criminals seeking to exploit fears over the pandemic have been reported to UK investigators, figures revealed earlier this month. Many of them have targeted elderly people who are self-isolating, while one of the latest included criminals asking for donations to help the NHS fight Covid-19.\nSeparately, some 13 companies have been registered on Companies House since late February with the name coronavirus, along with 11 that have Covid in the title.\nThere is no suggestion of any wrongdoing or intent to engage in wrongdoing by those connected with the companies.\nAmong them is Coronavirus Refunds Ltd, which was incorporated on 17 March by Muthupandi Ganesan, a barrister. Ganesan was approached for comment about his plans for the company but did not respond.\nGanesan leads the money Laundering and Asset Recovery team at the law firm, Scarmans. He also lectures internationally on anti-money laundering issues and has trained enforcement agencies, police, lawyers in states including India, Russia, Romania, Kyrgyzstan and the UK.\nOther companies include Coronavirus Deep Cleaning Services Ltd, Coronavirus Cleaning Products Ltd and Coronavirus Grants Support Services Ltd. The person controlling the companies, Ajay Patel, has been involved in a glazing business in Edgware, London.\nAsked by the Guardian what he intended to do with the new companies, Patel said they were part of a plan to help people. He didn’t intend to make any money out of them and he said he needed to speak to his accountant about his plans.\nOther companies include Covid 19 Fashion Ltd, which was incorporated at the end of March as a wholesaler of clothing, footwear and textiles by a woman in Essex."}, {"url": "https://news.err.ee/1061942/another-two-tallinn-residents-diagnosed-with-coronavirus", "title": "Another two Tallinn residents diagnosed with coronavirus", "text": "Another two Tallinn residents diagnosed with coronavirus ({{contentCtrl.commentsTotal}})\nThe Health Board's laboratory diagnosed two adults who recently returned from Northern Italy and France with COVID-19 on Tuesday morning, putting the total number of confirmed cases in Estonia at 13.\nThe board's laboratory has carried out a total of 350 COVID-19 tests since January 31. The Health Board and private company Synlab currently have the ability to test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes it.\nThe capacity will also be created at the North Estonia Medical Center, Tartu University Hospital, Ida-Viru Central Hospital and Pärnu Hospital in the coming days.\nPeople are tested based on a decision by healthcare workers who look at symptoms and whether the person has recently been in a high-risk area or could have had contact with carriers of the coronavirus.\nBased on the risk assessment of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the Health Board designates as high-risk coronavirus areas China, Italy, Iran and South Korea.\nA person can be successfully tested for the virus once they are exhibiting symptoms – a test administered before the person has a fever, cough or trouble breathing is likely to come back false negative.\nA person who suspects they may have the coronavirus should consult their family physician or call the family medicine hotline 1220. People experiencing more serious health concerns, such as trouble breathing should call the emergency hotline 112.\nPeople are urged not to go to the emergency room for risk of spreading the virus to others. People waiting for their test results or who have tested positive should stay home to avoid spreading the virus.\nBoth Tallinn and Tartu have special emergency response teams made up of a medic and ER specialist that respond to calls where the coronavirus is suspected. The brigades take test samples at people's homes.

", "text": "Coronavirus: Is social distancing an oxymoron in India?\nHealth experts and governments across the world have been advising people to practice social distancing to halt the spread of the deadly coronavirus.\nIn India too, we are constantly being told to avoid physical contact and maintain a distance of at least one metre from others.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi himself has talked about it repeatedly in his nationally-televised addresses to the citizens.\n\"If you want to tame the spread of the coronavirus, the only way to do it is to break the cycle of transmission by practicing social distancing,\" he said.\nMillions of people are following his advice, but what transpires every now and then makes one wonder if social distancing is an oxymoron in India.\nSome of the violations are, of course, driven by despair - for instance, when thousands of migrant workers turn up at the railway or bus station in the hope that they may be able to find some transport to return home.\n- Desperate migrant workers trapped in lockdown\nIndia has been under a complete lockdown for the past month, leaving millions of migrant workers stranded in towns and cities, far away from home, with no jobs or money.\nSo, every time they hear rumours that some transport services maybe resumed, crowds have gathered, defying laws on social distancing, at considerable risk to themselves and others.\nThen, there's also the matter of overcrowding. India is a country with more than 1.3 billion people and has a population density of 464 per sq km - in China, the world's most populous country, it is 153 and in the US it's just 36.\nAn average Indian family has five members and 40% of all homes - that is, 100 million homes - have only one room.\n\"In India, it's a privilege to be able to maintain social distancing when most of the population is huddled up five to six in a room,\" Kiran Lamba Jha, assistant professor of sociology at Kanpur's CSJM university, told the BBC.\n\"Social distancing is only possible if you have a large house,\" she said.\nDespair and overcrowding can be legitimate reasons, but in the past month, Indians have also displayed behaviour that defies reason and makes me wonder if we even understand the concept of social distancing?\n- Social distancing: How to persuade others it works\n- The virus reaches 'Asia's biggest slum'\nFor instance, just before the countrywide lockdown began, Mr Modi called upon Indians to observe a day-long self-imposed public curfew on 22 March.\nHe said coronavirus had no cure yet and the only way to stay safe was to stay home.\nAnd to thank those who couldn't stay home - like doctors and nurses and other emergency workers - the prime minister suggested that people come out in their balconies or stand in their doorways at 5pm and clap, beat metal plates, or ring bells for five minutes.\nPeople across India responded enthusiastically by participating in the curfew.\nBut at 5pm, all the good work of the day was undone - large groups of people came out onto the streets in many cities and towns, blowing conch shells, beating drums, clapping and clanging vessels.\nMany took selfies and shouted \"go corona, go\" as processions meandered through the lanes and bylanes.\nIncredibly, some of these processions were led by senior government officials and top policemen - the men who were meant to be educating people about social distancing and enforcing it.\nSimilar scenes were reported a couple of weeks later when Mr Modi called on the people to light candles and clay lamps to show solidarity with those affected by Covid-19.\nBy then, India was in the midst of a strict 21-day lockdown, but at many places, crowds poured out onto the streets, chanting slogans and setting off fireworks.\n\"The events were good at one level because by participating in them, people were trying to express social solidarity in times of crisis,\" says Prof Lamba Jha. \"But then people forgot that corona was still around,\" she laughs.\nBecause of the coronavirus, she says, we find ourselves in a kind of situation that's not normal, but distancing to many Indians is an alien concept.\n\"We say man is a social animal and Indians are more social than others. We don't like being alone, we have large families, we have lots of friends and neighbours, we thrive on social connectedness.\"\nIn places like the capital, Delhi, and across larger cities and towns though, police are working to enforce it strictly. In my local market, shops have circles drawn in chalk outside to ensure shoppers stand one-metre apart at all times.\nThere have been exceptions though - like when slum-dwellers mob a water tanker in a parched Delhi colony or when hundreds of poor and homeless clamour for food being distributed by charities in Noida, a Delhi suburb.\nI've seen photographs of packed vegetable markets three weeks into the lockdown In Patna city.\nAnd in Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad), people are still thronging ration shops and chemist stores.\nAnd in rural India, where 69% of the country's population lives, I hear social distancing is not doing well at all.\nAmarnath Tewary, a senior journalist in the northern state of Bihar, says social distancing is an \"urban phenomenon\".\nIn villages, people often live as a community, many families share a single water source and work together on farms and fields. In local markets, shoppers often stand within touching distance of each other, he says.\nProf Lamba Jha says that's because many villagers still think Covid-19 is a rich man's disease because it came to India from abroad.\n\"They feel cases of coronavirus are only in the cities, everything is fine in the villages.\n\"They can't understand what the fuss is about.\"\n- A SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?\n- AVOIDING CONTACT: The rules on self-isolation and exercise\n- HOPE AND LOSS: Your coronavirus stories\n- VIDEO: The 20-second hand wash\n- STRESS: How to look after your mental health"}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/wednesdays_papers_recovery_stories_the_psychological_challenges_of_staying_home_and_sunny_weather_in_store_for_some/11285718", "title": "Wednesday papers : Recovery stories , the psychological challenges of staying home , and sunny weather in store for some | Yle Uutiset", "text": "Wednesday’s papers: Recovery stories, the psychological challenges of staying home, and sunny weather in store for some\nThe press on Wednesday looks at the corona virus recovery numbers and the psychological challenges of staying at home.\nTabloid Ilta-Sanomat (IS) leads with a story that offers some hope in the face of the coronavirus crisis. HUS medical chief of staff Asko Järvinen tells the paper that hundreds of coronavirus patients have recovered – some of whom are over 80 years old.\n\"The oldest patients that I know who have recovered are over 80 years old or close to 80,\" Järvinen told IS.\nIn Finland there had been 1,384 reported cases of COVID-19, the coronavirus, and 17 deaths, as of 31 March.\nThe exact number of those who have recovered is not yet known, because only a portion of those who have taken ill have been hospitalised.\n\"Recovery takes about two weeks, if we look back at those who got sick two weeks ago, many of them have recovered,\" said Järvinen, who leads the infectious diseases ward at HUS, in the interview with HS.\nAccording to Järvinen, the epidemic is still on the rise in Finland. He predicts that the epidemic will peak in May, or possibly even later in Finland.\nNevertheless, there is light at he end of the tunnel, so to speak, for Finland and the Uusimaa region.\n\"On our ward today, we have the same amount of patients as the previous day. Patients are already leaving,\" Järvinen said.\nThe challenges of staying home\nHelsingin Sanomat's most-read story on Wednesday morning is an article about the many psychological challenges of staying at home.\nAccording to Helsinki University professor of psychology Marko Elovainio, who is interviewed by HS, minimising social contacts is one of biggest challenges of the corona crisis.\n\"We’re biologically made to be social. When taking care of and maintaining social relationships becomes difficult, it’s taxing, especially if we’re forced to be alone,\" said Elovainio in the interview with the paper.\nHS cites science publication The Lancet, which published an article in February about what types of psychological impacts previous quarantines have had on humans such as the isolation measures taken during the Sars and Ebola epidemics. Quarantine was a very difficult experience for many people, with increased fears of getting ill, bored or frustrated, reported the publication.\nAccording to HS, the typical crisis quarantine cycle begins with shock, and the thought that this can’t be happening. For some, the start of the crisis may seem like an opportunity for those who enjoy being at home alone.\nDuring the second phase feelings such as anxiety, fear and irritation start to rise to the surface, and many people experience difficulties concentrating. During this phase many start to get frustrated with the restrictions of being at home as it is no longer as pleasurable as it once was.\nAccording to The Lancet, having some freedoms makes a difference in helping with feelings of isolation. Elovainio also believes that this helps, as there’s no restriction on moving outdoors in Finland -- yet.\n\"A sunny day can perk some up. It also helps if we can get outdoors and even see people at a distance,\" says Elovainio.\nAs not everyone has the energy to get outdoors, Elovanio suggests calling friends and relatives. \"Speaking with someone else protects the psyche,\" he says.\nThe final phase is readjustment, when the mind starts to focus on the future, which is when hope enters the picture.\nFrosty turn\nAccording to tabloid Iltalehti, the weather looks to take a frostier turn in parts of the country with possible snow in store for the east and north, while warmer weather is in store for the south.\nIn southern and central regions, a mix of sunny and cloudy weather is in store. Snow flurries are expected in the east. Temperatures will be between +1 and +7 degrees Celsius.

THE CORONAVIRUS DIARIES\nIn the past week, we’ve been able to hear directly from physicians, mayors, and patients and their families. Here’s a glimpse into some of their stories.\nDeborah Copaken, one of our contributing writers, contracted the illness, as did her entire family. She wrote this essay from the middle of her family’s quarantine and recovery:\nPart of me wants, as soon as we’re better, to grab my three kids and my partner and escape someplace remote, but where? COVID-19 is everywhere. I guess the thought of simply breathing in and out without coughing and reuniting with my children, wherever that might be, is goal enough. To––literally––live and let live will be enough. Because in the middle of writing that last sentence, I learned that an old friend has been felled by COVID-19. Rest in peace, Mark Blum. I’m so sorry we didn’t do more to flatten the curve while we still could.\nFor Ramtin Arablouei, a radio producer and co-host of the NPR podcast Throughline, the coronavirus stripped away his family’s ability to grieve a member who died from COVID-19:\nMy aunt and cousins had to wear masks and stand dozens of meters away at the cemetery as men in protective suits laid Haji Ahmad into the grave. Earlier, my aunt had given one of the men a bottle of holy water from the well of Zamzam in Mecca. She had asked him to splash the water over her husband’s body before interring him. He complied.\nFred Milgrim, an emergency-medicine resident physician in New York City, one of the epicenters of the outbreak in the U.S., has this warning for the rest of the country:\nThese are not the best of times; even for my senior attendings, it is the worst they have ever seen. Here, the curve is not flat. We are overwhelmed. There was a time for testing in New York, and we missed it. China warned Italy. Italy warned us. We didn’t listen. Now the onus is on the rest of America to listen to New York. For many people around the country, the virus is still an invisible threat. But inside New York’s ERs, it is frighteningly visible.\nEvery day, in our hastily assembled COVID-19 unit, I put on my gown, face shield, three sets of gloves, and N95 respirator mask, which stays on for the entirety of my 12-hour shift, save for one or two breaks for cold pizza and coffee. Before the pandemic, I would wear a new mask for every new patient. Not now. There are not enough to go around.\nAnd Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, spoke to our L.A.-based staff writer Todd Purdum about what he’s anticipating:\nWe are, depending on how you calculate it, six to 12 days behind New York … If you just look at the raw numbers, if we have the same rate of increase that we’re experiencing the last couple of days, it would be about 12 days, but we’ve had some days in which the rate of increase is faster.\n2.

It’s also not clear that digital contact tracing is effective - early adopters including Singapore have had teething troubles.\nTechnologists agree that Bluetooth can be a powerful way to measure the proximity of contacts between individuals, while being less invasive than the location tracking used in countries like China or South Korea.\nWhere they disagree is on where Bluetooth contacts should be logged - on devices or on a central server. Apple and Alphabet’s Google back a decentralized approach that would only route information through a server if a notification is issued.\nThey have pledged to provide new application interfaces in May to support decentralized apps, and later incorporate contact tracing into their iOS and Android operating systems, which run 99% of smartphones.\nImportantly, Apple has resisted calls from Germany and France to allow the Bluetooth monitoring needed to support centralized apps to run on its iPhones in the background. This means that phones must be unlocked for the app to work - a drain on the battery and an inconvenience for the user.\nKenny Paterson, a professor at the Institute of Information Security in Zurich who is involved in DP-3T, dismissed suggestions that Apple and Google were imposing unreasonable conditions for contact tracing apps.\n“We have been talking to Apple and Google for weeks and we were delighted with the approach they proposed,” Paterson told Reuters, adding that it was “entirely compatible” with DP-3T.

Out of the gates in January they experienced a gradual ratchet higher, climbing to an all-time peak in America, before a brutal and swift 11.5% plunge in the S&P 500 during the last week of February. So far in March investors have loop-the-looped. After the Federal Reserve convened an emergency meeting on March 3rd to cut interest rates by 0.5 percentage points, stocks spun and gyrated and the yield on the ten-year Treasury bond fell below 1% for the first time ever (see chart).\nUncertainty and fear about the spread of the covid-19 disease are to blame for the havoc (credit for some of the gains on March 4th may belong to Joe Biden, a moderate Democrat, who won the most delegates in primary voting on “Super Tuesday”). The market is wrestling with three fears. First, that the virus will (and may already have) spread widely across America and the rest of the world. Second, that fear of covid-19 and measures to stem its spread, like advising workers to stay home, will have severe consequences for economic activity. And third, that policymakers may be unable to keep short-term disruption from becoming long-term damage.\nThese fears have culminated in a sharp “risk-off” move in markets. As stocks have tumbled, safe-haven assets like gold, government bonds and certain currencies—such as the yen and the Swiss franc—have rallied sharply. Copper and oil prices, both bellwethers of economic health, have swooned. The VIX, an index of the implied volatility embedded in options prices, has jumped. The price of high-risk corporate bonds fell sharply.\nThere are two reasons why rapid moves in markets are worth examining. They are important sources of information. By parsing changes in asset prices it is possible to glean insight into how the virus might affect the American economy. And while some markets merely predict doom, others can hasten its arrival—the healthy functioning of credit markets is especially vital.\nSo what does the market imply about economic expectations? One way of capturing this is to consider what will happen to firms’ finances if people can no longer gather or move around freely. Revenues would take a hit across the board. The damage would be most acute for firms that rely on large groups of people coming to them, such as casino and theme-park owners. It would, however, also hurt those that rely on travel, like hotels and airlines. Corporate events and conferences have been cancelled in many countries—Starbucks, for example, plans to hold its annual shareholder meeting virtually.\nSuch consumer-facing firms have seen bigger share-price falls than most. But revenues will also suffer at companies with complex supply chains. If factories close in China, firms like Apple are unable to produce their wares. While sales may plummet, costs will not. Firms will still need to pay their staff, landlords and banks, among many other expenses. The markets are suggesting that the hit to profits will be significant. In aggregate the stockmarket gyrations since the middle of February imply that investors, who once thought this year would see robust profit growth of 14.3%, now expect perhaps half that amount.\nBut the risks may be even greater for some companies, and possibly existential for those with large debts to service. Consumer companies in general have lost 7.1% of their market value since February 24th. But as our chart shows, the prices of listed firms with high interest expenses relative to profits have fallen more than their peers—those with lots of debt have fared worse (except for those purveying essentials, like Campbell Soup). This suggests investors think the risk of a cashflow crunch at some firms is very real. Smaller firms may be more exposed. According to the IMF, small and medium-sized firms with annual interest costs larger than their profits account for more than half of all corporate borrowing in America.\nThat feeds jitters about bad debts in credit markets. The interest-rate spread over Treasuries demanded by investors to hold high-yield corporate debt had widened to 4.9 percentage points on March 4th, from 3.3 percentage points at the start of the year. Public credit markets even briefly ground to a halt. There was hardly any corporate issuance at all between February 24th and March 2nd in America and Europe. Fear about tight credit markets was one of the reasons the Fed stepped in to cut rates. There is evidence it is helping. After the emergency rate cut on March 3rd a handful of issuers seized the opportunity to issue small quantities of bonds.\nTwo questions now hang over the markets. First, is their reaction to the epidemic exacerbated by technology? Algorithmic trading has come to dominate stockmarket transactions. Just one in ten equity trades is carried out by a human. Plenty of sensible people worry that these “algos” exacerbate short-term moves. But the evidence in this case suggests that they are not to blame. Algos tend to trade heavily at the open and the close. Market moves since the middle of February have been characterised by extremely high volumes throughout the day.\nSecond, will the turmoil continue? The VIX gauge offers the closest thing to an answer. Because stocks tend to sedately tick up, but lurch downwards, volatility usually only rises when stocks are falling. But recent news has caused stocks to lurch in both directions. Unusually, volatility therefore remains elevated despite a recovery in share prices. A high VIX also suggests that violent swings will continue. Investors should get used to the rollercoaster ride, because the end is not in sight. ■\nThis article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline \"Motion sickness\""}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/coronavirus_spreads_in_finnish_care_homes_16_deaths_so_far/11297042", "title": "Coronavirus spreads in Finnish care homes", "text": "Coronavirus spreads in Finnish care homes\nEight residents in a North Savo care home have died after being diagnosed with coronavirus.\nCoronavirus appears to have spread in Finnish care homes, with eight residents in one home in North Savo dying after being diagnosed with Covid-19, and nine in Helsinki homes also passing away.\nBoth staff and residents have been infected in the North Savo home, with all the deceased very old residents of the home.\nHealth authorities say that those with coronavirus have been isolated, and all the chains of infection in the region have been identified.\nAll staff members have been tested, with some still waiting for the results.

But the consequences are very different. Decisive factors are age, gender and possible previous illnesses.\nThe new coronavirus will spread rapidly in the coming weeks and months and two-thirds of the population will be infected. This is unlikely to change when it warms up again and the classic cold or flu season comes to an end, according to Christian Drosten, the leading virologist at the Berlin Charité hospital.\nHowever, the infection will take a mild course in most infected people. A majority of the population will already have formed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in autumn, when the next wave of colds comes.\nWhy do older people in particular need to be protected?\nOlder people are particularly at risk, as the mortality rate increases exponentially from around 65 years of age. In China, for example, the mortality rate of infected people up to 40 years of age was 0.2%, but between 70 and 79 years of age the mortality rate is already 8%, and from 80 years of age the rate is 14.8%.\nAccordingly, in the coming weeks and months, older people, in particular, must be protected, especially if they suffer from pre-existing conditions (see chart). This risk group should actually avoid crowds, concerts or club meetings.\nGrandma and grandpa should definitely not be used to care for grandchildren in quarantine or similar exceptional situations. Instead, younger family members should bring elderly people's shopping home so that they can avoid unnecessary visits to the supermarket.\nWhich previous illnesses increase the risk of corona infection?\nAlmost all deceased were already ill before their corona infection. According to a WHO analysis of the cases in China, older people with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic respiratory diseases and cancer are particularly at risk.\nWhy are men more frequently affected than women?\nAccording to WHO data, men die significantly more frequently than women from SARS-CoV-2. The death rate in China in mid-February was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women. A similar distribution already existed in 2003 with the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong. And even a normal flu usually hits men harder than women.\nThe female immune system is more resistant than that of men. This is mainly due to the female sex hormone estrogen, which stimulates the immune system and thus fights pathogens faster and more aggressively. The male sex hormone testosterone, on the other hand, inhibits the immune system.\nThere are also \"genetic reasons,\" according tomolecular virologist Thomas Pietschmann in an interview with DW. The reason is that \"some immune-relevant genes, for example, genes responsible for recognizing pathogens, are encoded on the X chromosome. Because women have two X chromosomes and men have only one, women have an advantage here. \"\nIn addition to genetic disposition, however, lifestyle is also a decisive factor. Men often live unhealthier lives than women. In China, for example, around 52% of all men smoke, but not even 3% of all women. A lung weakened by smoking is more susceptible to respiratory infections.\nWhy are children less at risk?\nWith the new coronavirus, children are surprisingly not among the weakest members of society — accordingly, there are no children among the fatalities so far.\nOf course, children are also infected with the virus, but they do not get sick, or show only mild symptoms. The reason for this is not yet fully understood. Doctors assume that the already innate \"unspecific system\" is effective in small children.\nFortunately, no children have died of COVID-19 yet\nAs protection against the first pathogens, the mother gives her own specific immune protection to the foetus and later to the newborn via breast milk. This innate immune defense includes, for example, scavenger and killer cells — white blood cells that attack all pathogens that enter the body via the mucous membranes or the skin.\nThis \"passive immunization\" usually lasts until children have built up their own defense system. By about the age of 10, children have developed their specific immune defense. But even after that, their defense system remains capable of learning throughout their lives when new pathogens appear.\nEvery evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

The outbreak in China of covid-19, a respiratory disease, invites a comparison to the last one, SARS. In that outbreak in 2003 China suffered a sharp hit to its growth, followed by a strong rebound. Although covid-19 has now claimed more lives than SARS, investors remain optimistic that its economic effects will follow a similar path.\nOn February 13th Hubei province, centre of the outbreak, announced 14,840 new confirmed cases, a sharp rise. That was because it suddenly started including CT-scan diagnoses, not just specific tests for the virus. Although the statistical fog is thick, indicators such as the fall in new cases outside Hubei and the total of suspected cases suggest that the rate of fresh infections may be trending lower.\nMost economists have thus only nudged down their forecasts for full-year global growth. Chinese stocks and commodities, which track economic prospects, have clawed back ground after initial falls. Global stockmarkets are higher than they were in January, when the severity of the outbreak became clear. We hope their optimism is justified. Yet the comparison makes two assumptions: in supposing that containing the virus maps neatly onto a better economic outlook; and in thinking that the world still works as it did when SARS was a threat.\nThere is an inherent tension between China’s apparent success in containing the epidemic and its growth prospects. Though less lethal, covid-19 seems more infectious than SARS. China has slowed its advance only by severely limiting people’s movement and closing businesses. If the government were to relax these controls too hastily, progress could stall or even go into reverse. So far, officials have erred on the side of caution. Provinces accounting for more than 90% of Chinese exports have kept factories either shut or running at low capacity since January 31st, when the lunar new-year holiday was due to end.\nIt is hard to overstate the effect on the economy. Coal consumption is more than a third lower than the average for this time of year. Property sales are down by more than 90%. After the holiday some 200m people usually leave their home towns to return to work. This year the trains that carry migrants have been nearly empty. Cities have warned outsiders that they might face 14-day quarantines. Nine out of ten companies surveyed by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai have employees working from home. Couriers still zoom around on their electric motorbikes, but the takeaway trade is not saving restaurants because people fear eating meals prepared by strangers who may be infected. Grabbing a latte is a risk too far. Starbucks has shut half its 4,000-plus cafés in China.\nThe second doubt is over the relevance of SARS as a comparison. The global economy has changed since 2003, when SARS struck. China now accounts for 16% of global GDP, up from 4% back then. And it is the world’s second-biggest importer, so any weakness, however temporary, is felt far and wide. Already, some of its firms are trying to get out of contractual commitments to import copper and liquefied natural gas. And its tourists, who spend $250bn a year on overseas travel, are staying at home.\nAccounting for China’s increased size is easy. But the economy has not just grown since 2000; its manufacturers have also become enmeshed in supply chains of mind-boggling complexity. A factory in Wuhan may provide parts to a firm elsewhere in China, which in turn supplies a factory in Stuttgart, with the final product emerging in Michigan. Just-in-time production leaves little room for delays. Many firms cannot trace all their suppliers, making it hard to predict the impact of work stoppages in China on their output, let alone on global GDP (see article). History provides little guidance on the effects of disrupted supply chains, because the world economy has not been organised around them for long.\nSome problems have already emerged. Hyundai has halted some car production in South Korea because parts are short. So has Nissan in Japan. Facebook has stopped taking orders for its new virtual-reality headset and Nintendo has delayed shipments of new gaming devices. Foxconn, which makes smartphones for Apple and Huawei, has restarted its factories but with skeletal staffing. And these are just the brands you have heard of. China churns out a third of the world’s chemicals, half of its LCD screens and two-thirds of its polyester. Companies that think they are isolated from China could be in for a surprise.\nIt is also possible that the virus spreads rapidly outside China. Infections in developing countries may be going undetected. Vietnam has quarantined 10,000 people, but most governments could not enact the measures that China is using to slow the disease, so covid-19 could yet become a pandemic. Wall Street’s optimism, in other words, is premature. If economists have a bias, it is to focus on things that are measurable and quantifiable.

This means a global outbreak, with the coronavirus spreading in the community in multiple parts of the world.\nIn each of these countries we are seeing spread of the virus with no connection to China. The lockdown efforts in Italy mirror those that have happened in China.\nThe situation in Iran is especially worrying because the health authorities have reportedly said the virus has spread to multiple cities, and it appears the first case in Lebanon is linked to a traveller from Iran.\nIf we have a pandemic, it will still be important to limit the speed of spread of the virus. If countries could hold it somewhat at bay until the end of winter, there is a hope that warmer temperatures will reduce the time the virus can survive in the air, as we see with seasonal flu. But this may not be certain.\nWhat's happening in South Korea?\nOn Sunday, health officials revealed a further leap in the number of coronavirus cases with a cluster of infections linked to a hospital and to a religious group near the south-eastern city of Daegu.\nThe sixth death was confirmed at the Daenam Hospital, in Cheongdo, which treats the elderly and people with mental health issues. The hospital has seen more than 110 people infected including nine medical staff.\nSouth Korea has seen the largest number of confirmed cases after China. An outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan has also seen more than 600 cases.\n\"The Covid-19 incident faces a grave turning point,\" President Moon said following a meeting with ministers and experts.\n\"The next few days will be crucial. The government will raise the alert level to the highest level of 'grave' according to experts' recommendations and drastically strengthen our response system.\"\nOf the 169 new cases announced in South Korea on Sunday, 95 of them are linked to a Christian sect in Daegu called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. The total number of cases connected to the church stands at 329.\nIn a video statement, a church spokesman expressed \"deep regret\" that many of its followers and citizens of South Korea had been infected. The spokesman added that the church had advised about 250,000 members to minimise their outside contact and take precautions.\nWhat is the Shincheonji?\n- Religious organisation founded in 1984 by South Korean national Lee Man-hee\n- Lee, now in his 80s, describes himself as \"the promised pastor\" mentioned in the Bible\n- Followers are taught to believe that Lee is the second coming of Jesus Christ\n- Shincheonji is the abbreviation from Korean of \"New Heaven and New Earth\"\n- Reportedly has more than 120,000 members around the world\n- Accused of being a cult, and has been involved in controversies in several countries\nIn other developments:\n- Israel refused to allow non-Israelis to disembark from a Korean Air plane at Ben-Gurion Airport on Saturday. It had announced a ban on South Koreans and Japanese visitors, sparking an official protest from Seoul\n- Dozens of evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship have begun their two-week quarantine in the UK\nWhat's the wider situation?\nThe head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has expressed concern at the number of new cases with no clear link to China or other confirmed cases.\nIn a briefing to the African Union on Saturday, he said the greatest concern now was countries with weaker health systems, particularly in Africa.\nDr Tedros said the WHO was working with African governments to train thousands of health workers and to provide equipment to identify and treat infected people.\n\"Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for Covid-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems,\" he said. \"We are working hard to prepare countries in Africa for the potential arrival of the virus.\"\nDr Tedros said some countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, were using experience gained from testing for the Ebola virus to test for the new coronavirus.\n\"This is a great example of how investing in health systems can pay dividends for health security,\" he added."}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/judge-blocks-kansas-church-gatherings-limit-order-fb6ce1df-3cc1-4aaf-9c61-5dbf7832b1c0.html", "title": "Judge blocks Kansas coronavirus order limiting church gatherings", "text": "Judge blocks Kansas coronavirus order limiting religious gatherings\nKansas Gov.

The Alliance Defending Freedom group, which represented two Baptist churches in the case, has filed several lawsuits challenging such orders in the U.S.\n- A notable suit the group brought was in Greenville, Mississippi, where the mayor reversed a ban last Wednesday on drive-in churches after the Department of Justice filed a Statement of Interest supporting the Temple Baptist Church's case.\nZoom in: U.S. District Judge John Broomes' temporary Kansas order will remain in effect until May 2 and a hearing is scheduled for Thursday.\nWhat they're saying: Per AP, Gov.

However, the government's behavior to date has been balanced, and there is no reason for panic, write lawyers Allar Jõks and Piret Schasmin. At the same time, the law does not allow for mandatory quarantining in any case.\nReading the various news portals in Estonia, one could be forgiven for thinking that Estonia was in an unusually special situation. The number of dramatic stories has already surpassed those last autumn (when stories regarding comments made by interior minister Mart Helme dominated the headlines for a time-ed.)\nThe figure of coronavirus victims in the country continues to grow, standing at 10 at the time of writing; the Italian government closed all its schools and universities two days ago, with several regions in the north of the country establishing quarantine conditions.\nSome days ago, before Estonia experienced its first confirmed case, Martin Kadai, head of the emergency department at the Health Board (Terviseamet) said that unlike Italy, Estonia would not be doing the same.\nHowever, what quarantine means in legal terms and in what cases it can be imposed in Estonia has so far been overlooked.\nPursuant to the Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Act (hereinafter NETS), quarantine is a restriction on the movement of people, goods, vehicles and services, the purpose of which is to prevent the spread of a particularly dangerous communicable disease beyond its current the outbreak. A distinction must be made between this and \"voluntary quarantine\", when people impose restrictions on movement themselves.\nNETS only allows local government to impose quarantine following a proposal from the Health Board in the case of a particularly serious infectious disease. Particularly dangerous infectious diseases in the understanding of NETS include cholera, yellow fever and tuberculosis, meaning coronavirus does not constitute a particularly dangerous infectious disease.\nDoes this mean that the country will experience a short battle with the virus, after which the Riigikogu should change the law and redefine coronavirus as a particularly dangerous infectious disease?\nNo it does not, because under NETS, a local authority may, again on a proposal from the Health Board, temporarily close schools, childcare and welfare facilities, requiring them to be disinfected, fumigated in the case of insectoid pests, or otherwise cleaned, and instigate public health surveys.\nThe head of a childcare or welfare institution may also, on his or her own initiative, temporarily close an institution they manage, in coordination with the Health Service regional office.\nIf coronara virus begins to endanger the lives and health of large numbers of people, the government may also declare a state of emergency and, if necessary, impose a ban on certain areas, or restrict freedom of movement.\nHowever, such intense restrictions on fundamental rights could apply only in exceptional circumstances, if the spread of the virus in Estonia was already so widespread.\nWe have to agree with Ants Nõmper, who wrote in Postimees on March 5 that the current situation in Estonia does not justify declaring a state of emergency.\nThe Estonian government has been accused of inciting panic and inaction. In light of the above, the behavior of the government to date can be considered balanced, and there is no reason for panic. At the moment, it really seems that \"the corona virus is infecting Estonia the most via social media,\" as [ERR journalist] Marju Himma wrote.\nAllar Jõks is a partner at Sorainen law firm, and a former Chancellor of Justice.

Authorities announced that there were some 9,000 confirmed cases of the virus across Iran.\nThe Fars story also comes amid days of speculation about the health of Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri. Jahangiri has not been seen in pictures of recent top-level meetings, raising concerns about him.\nMeanwhile on Wednesday, Kuwait announced a two-week shutdown of the country while confirmed cases in Qatar jumped from 24 to 262.\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.\nThere was no immediate report on state media about the Iranian officials being ill and no other media outlet in Iran immediately carried the report. Fars published it in a picture list of names in Farsi, with Jahangiri’s name at the top, saying he was in quarantine and improving, without elaborating.\nFars said the others sick are Ali Asghar Mounesan, minister of cultural heritage, handcrafts and tourism, and Reza Rahmani, minister of industry, mines and business.\nThe report comes at a sensitive time for Rouhani, who faced criticism for not being out front on the response to the virus. He’s been seen at government meetings where members sit meters apart from each other, likely to stop the potential spread of the virus. He also wore latex gloves while planting a tree at a recent event.\nHard-liners long have tried to embarrass Rouhani, whose administration pushed through Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.\nRouhani has 11 vice presidents. Another, Massoumeh Ebtekar, earlier fell ill with the virus. Ebtekar is better known to Americans as “Sister Mary,” the English-speaking spokeswoman for those who seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and began the 444-day hostage crisis.\nEbtekar tweeted Wednesday she had recovered from the virus, while linking to images of Western officials who have contracted the illness.\n“#Iran faces sanctions & psycho-terrorism,” she wrote. “They portray Iran as corona epicenter, accuse us of undercounting, count afflicted officials as proof. Reality: Numbers are clear, thank God I’m back in my office.”\nAcross the Mideast, the vast majority of the nearly 10,000 people who have contracted the coronavirus and the COVID-19 illness it causes are in hard-hit Iran or had recently returned from there. The Islamic Republic has one of the world’s worst death tolls outside of China, the epicenter of the outbreak. Outside of Iran, only Iraq, Egypt and Lebanon have recorded deaths from the virus in the Middle East.\nThe World Health Organization on Wednesday declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.\nKuwait announced late Wednesday the oil-rich nation would close down all work and business for two weeks beginning Thursday. Flights would halt to the nation from Friday, the country said. It has over 70 confirmed cases of the new virus. Restaurants, cafes and health clubs also will be closed, the state-run KUNA news agency reported.\nQatar reported a massive jump in cases of the new coronavirus late Wednesday as well, going up to 262. The small, peninsular nation home to long-haul airline Qatar Airways stressed the new cases had been found in quarantine and not mixing out in the public.\nIn the Gulf Arab island nation of Bahrain, authorities say their number of confirmed cases on Wednesday spiked by nearly 70% to 189 confirmed cases. The 77 new cases were all on a returning flight of Bahraini evacuees from Iran.\nThere are concerns that the number of infections across Iran is much higher than the confirmed cases reported by the government, which is struggling to contain or manage its spread. The rising casualty figures each day in Iran suggest the fight against the new coronavirus is far from over.\nAmong the dead are five Revolutionary Guard members and an unspecified number of the Guard’s volunteer Basij force.\nThat the Guard is involved in the relief effort of a major catastrophe is not surprising in Iran. The Guard, whose forces include an estimated 125,000-plus troops and 600,000 mission-ready volunteers, routinely respond to the earthquakes that shake the country. Recent floods saw its troops mobilize as well.\nMeanwhile Saudi Arabia, which has barred travel to and from 14 countries and halted pilgrimages to Islam’s holiest sites in Mecca and Medina, announced Wednesday it would close its recently reopened movie theaters until further notice.\nLebanon reported its second death Wednesday saying a 53-year-old man died of the virus. The Health Ministry said 37% of the cases reported in Lebanon originated from four countries: Egypt, Iran, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\nLater on Wednesday, Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab said flights will be halted form Iran, Italy, China and South Korea. Diab said Lebanese staying in countries that have large numbers of coronavirus cases have four days to return to Lebanon.\nIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a $2.8 billion rescue package to stabilize the economy as it grapples with the virus. The money will double a previously announced fund to help businesses hit by the crisis to $2.4 billion. It also includes roughly $280 million for the health sector.\nIsrael has diagnosed a total of 77 cases of the virus.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Aya Batrawy and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed to this report.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

The ban included domestic and international travel, with some exceptions, and police will use roadblocks to enforce the measure on the ground.\nIn the US, Trump stunned onlookers at a press briefing on Thursday when he riffed on his “interest” in looking at using ultraviolet lights or even injecting disinfectant into people to treat Covid-19.\nRobert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and a former labor secretary, said Trump’s briefings were “actively endangering the public’s health”.\n“Boycott the propaganda. Listen to the experts. And please don’t drink disinfectant,” he said.\nAt the briefing Trump, remarked on research by the Department of Homeland Security that said the virus appeared to weaken faster under exposure to sunlight, heat and humidity.\nWilliam Bryan, its acting undersecretary for science and technology, told the briefing tests using disinfectants had showed the virus could be killed within minutes by some substances.\nDr Irwin Redlener, the director of the Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, told the MSNBC network: “Everything that this scientist talked about from homeland security was basically incoherent, nonsensical, not really supported by evidence and really quite contrary to a lot of things that we do know about some of the things he was saying.”\nAustralia’s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, was barely able to contain incredulous laughter when asked if anyone should follow the US president’s latest suggestion.\n“Um ... I would not ... I would caution against the injection of disinfection! They could be quite toxic to people …And ultraviolet light, look, I don’t know the context in which he said it, so I really would need to study it before I could comment.”\nThe US has reported almost 50,000 deaths and 870,000 cases, according to the John Hopkins University tracker, and could extend social distancing measures. Congress passed a $500bn relief package late on Thursday, bringing the US’s crisis spending to nearly $3tn.\nMeanwhile, China’s ambassador to the UK strongly rebuked the US for suggesting Beijing was not truthful about the coronavirus, saying Washington should not seek to bully China in a manner reminiscent of the 19th century European colonial wars.\n“Some other country – their local courts sued China – it is absurd,” Liu Xiaoming said, a possible reference to legal action launched by Missouri. “Some politicians, some people, want to play at being the world’s policeman – this is not the era of gunboat diplomacy, this is not the era when China was a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society.”\nIn other global developments:\nAbout 91 crew on Italian cruise ship, the Costa Atlantica, have Covid-19, Japanese officials said on Friday. The ship is docked in Japan’s south-western port of Nagasaki, and those who have tested negative will be repatriated, health minister Katsunobu Kato said on Friday. Japan is also taking drastic measure to discourage people from gathering outside, by cutting the buds off thousand of roses in parks to deter public gatherings.\nThe Philippines extended its lockdown in the capital, Manila, until 15 May. President Rodrigo Duterte, also threatened to declare martial law if communist rebels disrupted the flow of relief goods for Filipinos affected by the restrictions, and asked his military to be ready.\nTom Hanks has sent a heartfelt letter and a Corona-brand typewriter to an Australian boy who wrote to him about being bullied over his name, Corona.

Our science writer Ed Yong reports in this single most important story of the current moment how this will all play out, and explores the changes that need to be made urgently for the U.S. to come back from the brink.\nThe first and most important is to rapidly produce masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment. If health-care workers can’t stay healthy, the rest of the response will collapse. In some places, stockpiles are already so low that doctors are reusing masks between patients, calling for donations from the public, or sewing their own homemade alternatives. These shortages are happening because medical supplies are made-to-order and depend on byzantine international supply chainsthat are currently straining and snapping.

In a poll published on February 25th, 65% of Democratic voters told YouGov that nominating a candidate who can beat the president in November is more important than selecting one who shares their positions on most issues. Yet there is much confusion over who is best able to evict Mr Trump.\nPolitical polls offer one answer. Most show the various candidates beating Mr Trump by wide enough margins nationally that they would be favoured to win an electoral-college majority. But the election is a long way away, and these polls may not be good at identifying who will actually vote, making them unreliable as measures of candidates’ strength.\nPolitical-betting markets offer another answer to the electability question. Using data from the past 14 months of trading on PredictIt.com, a stockmarket of sorts for betting on political outcomes, The Economist built a statistical model to figure out which candidate has the best chance against Mr Trump. Contenders are weaker if an increase in their odds of winning the nomination corresponds to a boost in the odds of the president’s re-election; and stronger if the probability of their victory dents the president’s. After controlling for various factors—such as the chance that Mr Trump does not finish his first term in office, his approval ratings, the value of the S&P 500 and the recent outbreak of covid-19—our model highlights a clear difference among the candidates.\nIf Bernie Sanders wins the nomination, Mr Trump is likely to be re-elected, with a probability of 58%. But if the president is up against Joe Biden or Mike Bloomberg, he is likely to lose; the probability of his victory drops to 46% and 49% respectively.\nOur analysis of punters’ prices also suggests that the identity of the Democratic candidate could sway the final outcome of the vote as much as other factors popularly cited as influencing elections. Each 1% increase in the S&P 500—about one-third of the average monthly movement in the index—nudged up Mr Trump’s chance of re-election by about half a percentage point. Mr Trump’s approval ratings, which have been low and very stable compared to other presidents, had similar effects on the outcome. Even though the candidates matter, our model predicts a close election regardless of who becomes the Democratic nominee for president.\nDig deeper:\n- Sign up and listen to Checks and Balance, our new newsletter and podcast on American politics\n- Explore our guide to the US 2020 elections"}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-telemedicine-health-care-92cbba4d-a504-41ac-b797-ee01c2f6e219.html", "title": "The coronavirus crisis is taking the shackles off telemedicine", "text": "Telemedicine doesn't waste a crisis\nIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\nWe're going to see more medical care delivered remotely — both during the pandemic and after.\nThe big picture: Health care has always been one of our most regulated industries, which slows the pace of innovation.

But after President Trump declared a state of emergency on March 13, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provided blanket waivers for telemedicine providers to practice across state lines.\n- There are still complexities around private insurance networks that vary from state to state, but Chopra expects remote radiology to continue to grow. \"This is going to change the industry dramatically.

That potentially opens up a much larger portion of the economy to automation at a moment when the pandemic has already forced businesses to go remote.\nA recent survey from Bain and Company of nearly 800 executives worldwide estimated that the number of companies scaling up such automation technologies is set to double over the next two years — and that coronavirus will almost certainly accelerate that timeline.\n- Businesses are already using automated bots to respond to the pandemic, says Michael Heric, the leader of Bain's Automation Center of Excellence and a co-author of the report. That includes processing testing kits and helping with SBA loan applications.\n- \"We see a lot of clients saying that remote work during the pandemic demonstrates that some of this activity should be automated as well,\" says Heric.\nDetails: Physical robots are certainly getting a boost as companies respond both to the pandemic and the economic downturn, as I wrote in Future last week. But software agents that can automate business processes — which, somewhat confusingly, are also referred to as \"robots\" — can be introduced more rapidly to a much wider range of companies, especially as more of the economy moves online.\n- UiPath, a leading RPA vendor, is working with a hospital in Dublin to produce software robots capable of rapidly disseminating COVID-19 test results, which the company says can save nurses as much as three hours of work per day.\n- IPsoft has developed an \"AI digital colleague\" called Amelia that can work to intelligently answer service requests for banks, IT desks, and other businesses that interface online with customers. More recently, the company has used Amelia to help the AskMD platform screen users online for COVID-19 symptoms.\n- Gloat provides an AI platform that helps HR departments in large companies like Schneider Electric provide career development for employees — a particularly challenging task at a moment when most workers have been forced to operate remotely.\nWhat they're saying: RPA was already on the rise before COVID-19 hit, thanks to continually improving machine learning technology. But the unique circumstances of the pandemic — and the tendency of companies to invest in labor-replacing automation during economic downturns — will see it infiltrating the economy even faster.\n- At an uncertain moment when companies might need to rapidly scale up or down certain parts of their business, \"software robots give you immense flexibility,\" says Ashim Gupta, the chief financial officer at UiPath.\n- With the physical world largely off-limits for an unknown period of time, companies need to go digital first, says Jonathan Crane, chief commercial officer for IPsoft. \"We need to do this polar shift from the days when business processes were managed by people and assisted by technology, to one where business processes are managed by technology and assisted by humans.\"\nThe catch: While industrial robots have and will continue to displace some human workers in manufacturing and other physical occupations, more than three-quarters of the U.S. economy is now provided by the services sector. That means vastly more jobs are at least somewhat at risk from the spread of this brand of automation, on top of the tens of millions of jobs already lost during the initial months of the pandemic.\n- \"There are very serious displacement problems that we should be worried about,\" says Michael Lotito, co-chair of the Workplace Policy Institute at Littler. \"If we don't embrace these issues now, there are opportunities here for social unrest.\"\nYes, but: Companies in the space insist that software robots are less about outright replacing human employees than augmenting them by taking low-level, repetitive work off their hands. The result is what some experts call a \"hybrid workforce.\"\n- \"This isn't primarily about reducing costs,\" says UiPath's Gupta. \"This is about using robots to handle a surge in volume.\"\n- Bain's Heric notes that many of the lowest-skilled service jobs — like those found in call centers — had already been outsourced from the U.S. to countries like India and the Philippines, and that workers there could be in trouble. \"That's where the impact of automation is really going to be felt.\"\nThe bottom line: The pandemic has shown us that many of us can do our jobs remotely because at the end of the day, we're primarily working with a computer online. Don't be surprised if more and more of that work is done by the computer itself."}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/03/30/moscow-pleads-for-private-clinics-help-in-coronavirus-fight-a69799", "title": "Moscow Pleads for Private Clinic Help in Coronavirus Fight", "text": "Moscow’s mayor has asked for the Russian government’s help in getting private clinics to provide beds for coronavirus patients, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported Monday.\nMayor Sergei Sobyanin, who sits on Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin’s coronavirus coordinating council, named hospital beds and the national healthcare system’s mobilization as top priorities in the country's fight against the pandemic.\n“I would ask you to instruct us so that we could work through a network of private clinics that could provide such assistance,” Sobyanin told Mishustin, according to RIA Novosti.\nOfficials have said that Russia plans to build new isolation units, based on close study of similar facilities built in China, for patients in several regions in response to the coronavirus’ spread.\nMoscow’s hospital wards have been repurposed to treat patients with the virus.

True, growth had slowed a bit in 2019: from 2.9% to 2.3% in the US and from 3.6% to 2.9% globally. Still, there had been no recession and as recently as January, the International Monetary Fund projected a global growth rebound in 2020. The new coronavirus, Covid-19, has changed all of that.\nEarly predictions about Covid-19’s economic impact were reassuring. Similar epidemics – such as the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), another China-born coronavirus – did little damage globally. At the country level, GDP growth took a hit but quickly bounced back, as consumers released pent-up demand and firms rushed to fill back orders and restock inventories.\nIt is becoming increasingly clear, however, that this new coronavirus is likely to do much more damage than Sars. Not only has Covid-19 already caused more deaths than its predecessor; its economic consequences are likely to be compounded by unfavourable conditions – beginning with China’s increased economic vulnerability.\nChina’s economy has grown significantly more slowly in the last decade than it did previously. Of course, after decades of double-digit growth, that was to be expected and China has managed to avoid a hard landing. But Chinese banks hold large amounts of non-performing loans – a source of major risks.\nAs the Covid-19 outbreak disrupts economic activity – owing partly to the unprecedented quarantining of huge subsets of the population – there is reason to expect a sharp slowdown this year, with growth falling significantly below last year’s official rate of 6.1%. During the recent meeting of G20 finance ministers, the IMF downgraded its growth forecast for China to 5.6% for 2020 – its lowest level since 1990.\nThis could hinder global growth considerably because the world economy is more dependent on China than ever. In 2003, China constituted only 4% of global GDP; today, that figure stands at 17% (at current exchange rates).\nMoreover, because China is a global supply-chain hub, disruptions there undermine output elsewhere. Commodity exporters – including Australia, and most of Africa, Latin Americaand the Middle East – are likely to be affected the most, as China tends to be their largest customer. But all of China’s major trading partners are vulnerable.\nFor example, Japan’s economy already contracted at an annualised rate of 6.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, owing to last October’s consumption-tax increase. Add to that the loss of trade with China, and a recession – defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP – now seems likely.\nEuropean manufacturing could also suffer considerably. Europe is more dependent on trade than, say, the US and is linked even more extensively to China through a web of supply chains. While Germany narrowly escaped recession last year, it may not be so lucky this year, especially if it fails to undertake some fiscal expansion. As for the UK, Brexit may finally have the long-feared economic consequences.\nAll of this could happen even if Covid-19 does not become a full-blown pandemic. In fact, while the virus is proliferating in some countries, such as South Korea, a high infection rate is not a prerequisite for economic hardship. The spectre of contagious disease tends to have a disproportionate impact on economic activity because healthy people avoid traveling, shopping and even going to work.\nSome still cling to growth optimism, rooted in recent trade agreements negotiated by the US president Donald Trump’s administration: the phase one deal with China and the revised free-trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. But while those agreements are far better than they would have been had Trump stuck to the hardline positions he once defended, they do not represent an improvement over the situation that prevailed before he took office; if anything, their net impact is likely to be negative.\nConsider the phase one deal with China: not only does it leave in place high tariffs; it also remains fragile, owing to a lack of credibility on both sides. In any case, its impact is likely to be limited. China may not be able to deliver on its promise to purchase an extra $200bn worth of goods from the US, and even if it does, that is unlikely to translate into higher US exports. Instead, those exports will simply be diverted from other customers.\nWhile global recessions are exceedingly difficult to forecast, the odds of one – particularly one characterised by less than 2.5% growth, a threshold set by the IMF – now seem to have risen dramatically. (Unlike advanced-economy growth, global growth rarely falls below zero because developing countries have higher average trend growth.)\nSo far, US investors seem unconcerned about these risks. But they may be taking too much comfort from the US Federal Reserve’s three interest-rate cuts last year. Should the US economy falter, there is nowhere near enough room for the Fed to cut interest rates by 500 basis points, as it has in past recessions.\nEven if a recession does not materialise in the near term, Trump’s approach to trade may herald the end of the era when steadily rising international trade (as a share of GDP) buttressed global peace and prosperity. Instead, the US and China may continue on the path toward economic decoupling, within the context of a broader process of de-globalisation.

A new platform that would allow doctors to test a single sample for thousands of different pathogens could revolutionize disease response.\nThe new testing platform, called CARMEN and developed by scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, provides one possible answer to a question that often bedevils doctors: What are sick patients actually infected with?\n- Doctors often generally treat people who present with respiratory disease symptoms first, and then find out the cause later — or often, never.\nHow it works: The Broad Institute's new test uses rubber chips slightly larger than a smartphone, each with tens of thousands of \"microwells\" — compartments that hold two tiny droplets. One droplet contains viral genetic material from a sample, while the other contains virus-detection reagents.\n- When the detection droplet, which includes the CRISPR protein Cas13, finds the specific viral genetic sequence being targeted — like the novel coronavirus — it produces a detectable signal.

Ministers needed to respond with the offer of guaranteed jobs, focusing apprenticeship opportunities on young workers and introducing new maintenance grants to encourage the under 25s to extend their education by a year.\nThe RF said a short-term lack of job opportunities would lead to long-term scarring of young people.

A year after leaving education the pay of graduates is projected to be 7% lower, and 9% and 19% lower for mid- and low-skilled workers.\nOver the past 10 years one in three non-graduates, and one in five graduates, got their first post-education employment in sectors such as retail, hospitality, travel and leisure – the sectors hardest hit by the lockdown.\nKathleen Henehan, a research and policy analyst at the RF, said: “The 800,000 young people set to leave education this year amid an unprecedented economic crisis are facing huge immediate unemployment risks, and longer-term damage to their careers.\n“The ‘corona class of 2020’ could face years of reduced pay and limited job prospects, long after the current economic storm has passed, unless the government provides additional support, and fast.\n“A new maintenance support scheme could help thousands stay in education and build up their skills, while those entering the labour market for the first time should be supported by a job guarantee offering critical employment experience.”\nMeanwhile, a separate report highlighted the fragility of Britain’s companies affected by an extended lockdown.

On Feb. 24, the 13th National People’s Congress issued a decision “Comprehensively Prohibiting the Illegal Trade of Wild Animals, Eliminating the Bad Habits of Wild Animal Consumption and Protecting the Health and Safety of the People.” This and an earlier ban on wildlife markets were direct responses to concerns that the new coronavirus, which is thought to have originated in bats, may have been transmitted to humans via a wild animal for sale at a wet market in Wuhan, a city in central China.\nGenetic analyses have come up short of pinpointing the culprit so far, but among the prime suspects is the pangolin, a long-snouted, scaly, ant-eating mammal virtually unknown in the West but widely prized in China as a delicacy and for its purported medicinal virtues.\nSo now, on suspicion that it might have infected humans with Covid-19, the pangolin will finally be spared and protected. Or will it?\nChina has had wildlife trading bans on the books for three decades, but those haven’t prevented pangolins from becoming the most trafficked mammal in the world.\nThe country’s first wildlife protection law dates back to the late 1980s, as does an official list of some 330 endangered species. Illegally poaching, smuggling or trading pangolins, for example, can carry lengthy prison terms.\nIn 2000, China issued detailed regulations for more than 1,700 protected species considered to have biological, scientific or social value. Hunting toads in a pond or catching geckos could count as a violation.\nIn 2007, the sale of pangolin products outside of specially certified hospitals and clinics was outlawed. In 2018, Hubei Province, where Wuhan is, created some 300 wildlife conservation zones and cracked down on unlicensed hunting and trading.\nBut none of this has helped pangolins. In January 2019, nine tons of pangolin scales — thought to have come from some 14,000 animals — were seized in a single shipment in Hong Kong. The next month, 33 tons of pangolin meat were discovered in Malaysia, and in April, 14 tons of scales in Singapore.\nAccording to a 2016 report by the wildlife advocacy group WildAid, more than a million pangolins had been poached over the previous decade, accounting, some say, for as much as 20 percent of all illegal wildlife trading.\nAccording to TRAFFIC, a global wildlife trade monitoring network, from 2007 to 2016 some 90,000 pangolins were smuggled into China. In 2017, a ban on the international commercial trade of all eight species of pangolins went into effect under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (China is a party to it). Yet by last year, the Chinese pangolin had become “functionally extinct” in China, according to the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Group, a Chinese organization.\nOver the past two decades, the population of Malayan pangolins has dropped by 80 percent and those of Filipino and Indian pangolins by 50 percent.\nOne problem is that the regulatory framework in China hasn’t specified what wildlife entails. Enforcement has been lax, and there were exceptions anyway for licensed retailers, like Chinese medicine shops and online sellers. The latest ban also has loopholes that will allow the trade of wildlife for medicine or research.\nAnd then, of course, there is tremendous demand for pangolins, and with that comes, for poachers and sellers, great economic benefits. The price of live pangolins has increased from about $7 per pound in the 1990s to around $300 today.\nPangolin hot pot is considered a delicacy. Officials have been known to try to impress high-level guests with a pangolin meat stir-fry. Braise or steam pangolin with ginger and citronella, and show off the results online. The meat is a status symbol.\nThe scales, in particular, are thought to have health properties. In one 2015 survey, 70 percent of Chinese respondents said they believed that consuming pangolin could cure rheumatism and skin diseases and heal wounds. People hold some of these beliefs thinking they are rooted in traditional Chinese cuisine and medicine.\nExcept that our ancestors actually said otherwise.\nIf anything, the meat of pangolins was believed to cause ailments, rather than cure any: It tastes bitter and was thought to be poisonous. “Beiji Qianjin Yaofang” (备急千金要方), a collection of prescriptions compiled by Sun Simiao, an alchemist of the Tang dynasty, advised in 652: “There are lurking ailments in our stomachs. Don’t eat the meat of pangolins, because it may trigger them and harm us.” “Bencao Gangmu” (本草纲目, Compendium of Materia Medica), the Chinese medicine and cuisine capstone by Li Shizhen (1518-93) — an herbalist, naturalist and physician — warned that people who eat pangolin “may contract chronic diarrhea, and then go into convulsion and get a fever.”\nAncient texts also cautioned against eating any number of other wild animals, including snakes and badgers and other creatures, such as boars, that today are thought to sometimes transmit diseases to humans.\nAnd yet big data retrieved from Baidu, China’s equivalent of Google, show that over the decade before the Covid-19 outbreak, between 2009 and 2019, the keyword “pangolin” accounted for 23 percent of all the searches for “ye wei” (野味), or “wild tastes.” It trumped searches for boar, bamboo rat and palm civet.\nSince last month’s ban on certain civets, bats, marmots — and pangolins — searches for what wild animals can still be eaten have been trending on Chinese social media. “Are bullfrogs still available?” “How about deer?” “And quail? Or quail eggs?”\nDid pangolins transmit the coronavirus to humans? Is Covid-19 their revenge on us for bringing them to the edge of extinction? In any event, yet another ban on trading and eating pangolins isn’t likely to help them, especially with its caveats for medical uses. Better instead to take on modern misconceptions about health and traditions — and for that, nothing beats going back to centuries-old texts.\nWufei Yu is a Chinese journalist and contributor to Outside Magazine.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/international/2020/02/22/experts-predict-that-covid-19-will-spread-more-widely", "title": "Watchful waiting - Experts predict that covid - 19 will spread more widely | International", "text": "“THERE ARE so many crises in Congo.” Gervais Folefack, who co-ordinates the emergency programmes run by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has mastered the art of the understatement. The country has been shattered by war and corruption. “All the time we are responding to crises,” says Dr Folefack. He lists the most recent: Ebola, measles, cholera. To them, he may well have to add covid-19, a respiratory disease that originated in China. Those who would need to respond to a surge in covid-19 cases are already busy with the Ebola outbreak that began in 2018. “We are trying to prepare,” continues Dr Folefack, but there is simply not enough time.\nSo far 99% of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus have been in China. Of the 1,000-odd cases outside mainland China, more than half have been on the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship docked in Japan; the rest are scattered among 27 countries, mostly in Asia. Covid-19 has spread rapidly in China despite the government locking down entire cities for weeks. China’s efforts, along with the travel restrictions that many countries have imposed on its citizens, have slowed the virus’s progress. But many experts fear that it will inevitably become a pandemic. Health authorities are frantically trying to prepare.\nOn February 12th Nancy Messonnier of America’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said America should be prepared for the virus “to gain a foothold” in the country. Doctors in South Africa are on high alert, says Cheryl Cohen of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. More than 850 medics in all nine of the country’s provinces have been taught to spot the disease. The WHO is sending surgical masks, gowns and gloves to hospitals in more than 50 countries. It is teaching health workers across Africa how to use them to prevent covid-19 infections—and how to treat those who have the disease.\nGrowing numbers of countries are screening passengers at airports and borders for signs of covid-19. But when a virus starts travelling around the world, says Michael Ryan of the WHO, its real point of entry is a busy emergency room or a doctor’s surgery. In the 2003 outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), another coronavirus which spread to more than 20 countries, about 30% of the 8,000 people infected were health-care workers. Many, if not most, of the SARS outbreaks around the world—from Toronto to Singapore— started in a hospital with a single patient who had been infected abroad.\nIn countries where covid-19 cases are still rare doctors are, for now, trying to identify suspected patients by asking those with a cough and fever about recent travel to countries with outbreaks of the disease and then testing them. In America if patients test negative for seasonal flu, laboratories are starting to test for covid-19 (the country has so far identified 29 cases).\nConfirming a suspected infection in a laboratory can take days. Some small European countries have just one or two laboratories able to process covid-19 tests. Europe’s entire supply of test kits is shipped from the two main laboratories of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU’s public-health agency. America’s supply all comes from the CDC in Atlanta. It will be several months before commercial tests are available.\nTests could soon run short if other countries experience covid-19 epidemics like China’s. Delays in getting the results would increase. A lab technician must first prepare the samples. After that, processing each test through a molecular-analysis machine can take an hour and a half. These machines also run tests for the seasonal flu and other diseases. A covid-19 epidemic in the middle of winter—peak season for the common flu—would quickly overwhelm laboratories in most countries. Rapid diagnostic tests for the new virus that are as quick to carry out in doctors’ offices as pregnancy tests were at the top of the wishlist at a WHO meeting about research priorities for covid-19 in February.\nOnce an epidemic is in full swing, extensive testing to find everyone who might have the disease is less useful, says John Hick, an emergency co-ordinator at the Hennepin County Medical Centre in Minneapolis. At that point, he says, doctors will start to diagnose probable cases by symptoms alone—which is common practice for many illnesses, including the flu. Medics in parts of China are already doing this.\nAs with other contagious diseases, covid-19 patients in hospitals must be isolated to prevent its spread. When patients become too numerous to contain in isolation rooms, shared rooms, wings or entire floors may be set aside for covid-19 patients only. The Vrije University hospital in Amsterdam has dusted off its plans for doing this, including where to put “do not cross” lines to separate such sections, says Rosa van Mansfeld, who oversees infection prevention there. When all Dutch hospitals are overwhelmed, the lights will be turned on at the country’s “calamity hospital”, a fully equipped facility in Utrecht that is otherwise shut (it last opened to care for the victims of a terrorist shooting in 2019). In Kinshasa, Congo’s capital, an empty Ebola treatment centre will be used when covid-19 cases are identified.\nDr Hick says the biggest challenge if the disease starts to circulate widely in Minneapolis will be staffing. With no vaccine to protect them, many doctors and nurses will be infected. Others will need to stay at home to look after their children because schools may be closed. In its disaster planning, the hospital where Dr Hick works considered offering child care on-site for its staff. But he admits that people may be reluctant to bring their offspring to a hospital during an epidemic.\nHospitals will encourage people who do not seem to be seriously ill to stay away, as they do during the peak of seasonal flu. In part, that is to prevent them from straining the capacity of hospitals that are already overwhelmed. Doctors have no treatment to offer those with mild symptoms but in a hospital they can infect other patients or medics. Such people will be advised to isolate themselves at home. Others with mild symptoms may in fact have a different bug—but if they flock to hospitals, they may contract covid-19 for real.\nHospitals in both rich and poor countries are worried that in the event of an epidemic they will quickly run out of masks, gowns and gloves. Guidelines by the ECDC say that 24 disposable sets per day may be needed for a covid-19 patient in an intensive-care unit. The WHO says that a global shortage is already occurring, with a 20-fold rise in prices for some types of equipment. Surging demand in Asia, stockpiling by hospitals and disrupted production in China have all contributed to shortages of surgical masks.\nSome hospitals are trying to conserve supplies. Dr van Mansfeld says that nurses in her hospital in Amsterdam are being reminded not to use the high-protection respirator masks if they are caring for patients for whom the guidelines say ordinary surgical masks suffice. At some point, says Dr Hick, medics may have to start reusing respirator masks judiciously. Instead of throwing them away after each patient, they could remove them, handling them particularly carefully so that any germs on the outer surfaces are not transferred to their mouths or noses, and re-use them.\nThe swine-flu pandemic, which was caused by the H1N1 virus and infected 16% of the world’s population in 2009, brought home the message that doctors would have to make such tough decisions when big epidemics strike, says Dan Hanfling of In-Q-Tel, an American organisation that invests in national-security technology. Between the first and the second wave of H1N1 infections in America, the country’s National Academies of Sciences developed a set of “crisis standards of care”. These specify what doctors should do as shortages of medical supplies become worse.\nOne course of action is to substitute treatments with near-equivalents, such as drugs that have a similar effect. Another is to adapt what is available for different uses. For example, simpler breathing machines from ambulances may be used as substitutes for the sophisticated machines in intensive-care units. Medics may have to clean and re-use equipment, such as catheters, rather than throw it away after each use (as doctors in poor countries do every day, Dr Hanfling points out).\nThe hardest decisions would come when all these options are exhausted. Few countries have discussed how doctors would choose which patients get ventilators when there are not enough for everyone who needs one. If doctors have one patient who is on a ventilator but clearly getting worse, and another who is healthier and more likely to survive, they can justify reallocating the ventilator to the second patient. But such decisions would be particularly hard to make with covid-19, based on what doctors already know about the disease. A patient may be on a ventilator for several weeks and show little improvement but still make a good recovery.\nBe prepared\nAmerica is ahead of most countries in planning for such things, says Dr Hanfling. Disasters such as Hurricane Katrina—when many patients died in hospitals that were unprepared for disaster—laid bare the need to prepare for the worst. Each year the federal government gives states and hospitals about $1bn specifically for disaster preparedness. That is more than the national health budget of many African countries. Other countries’ recent experience may help them. Kerala, the only state in India to have confirmed cases of covid-19, swiftly contained an outbreak of Nipah, a nasty virus, in 2018 and has since bolstered its health system. Uganda has held back the spread of Ebola from next-door Congo and in the process built up stocks of protective clothing for health-care workers.\nBut poor countries would be hit particularly hard by outbreaks of covid-19. Uganda is used to dealing with diseases transmitted through blood, mosquitoes or parasites. Covid-19, if it comes, could spread quickly and unpredictably, which would test a cash-strapped health-care system. Ian Clarke, chair of a private health federation based in Uganda, worries that the mortality rates could be higher in Africa than they are in China because many people already have weakened immune systems as a result of HIV or poor nutrition. SARS mostly skipped Africa; the continent may not be so lucky with the new virus.■\nCorrection (February 20th): An earlier version of this article misstated the name of Ms. Messonnier.

To my knowledge, protocols for elders, the most vulnerable group, still don’t exist. This isn’t a UCSF-specific practice; it’s standard throughout the country. American medicine lumps elders in with adults, despite abundant evidence that drugs and diseases behave differently in older bodies. Additionally, health-screening procedures for visitors were put into place at our children’s hospital at the start of March, while similar procedures weren’t implemented for our adult hospital until two weeks later. You could argue that the children’s hospital is smaller and thus easier to manage; you could also surmise that protecting adults and elders was less of a priority, despite the greater risk of hospitalization and death those groups face.\nTransgressions like these are minor in the face of global calamity, but we’re seeing similar decisions being made nationally. With each one, this country loses precious time to take the actions that will limit contagion and save the most lives, old and young: screening those at highest risk to limit spread; documenting the predictably different early symptoms in older people; and creating care pathways that offer options to patients for whom aggressive medical treatment would only prolong suffering and not prevent death.\nLet me be perfectly clear: I’m not witnessing the actions of malicious, underperforming people. On the contrary, UCSF leadership has been heroic and selfless, working around the clock to provide the best care possible to those with COVID-19 while protecting other patients and staff. Ironically—no, tragically—that noble intent reveals just how entrenched and pervasive ageism is in American health care. It’s baked into how the field approaches education, research, and the most fundamental procedures, structures, and policies.\nMedical schools devote months to teaching students about child physiology and disease, and years to adults, but just weeks to elders; geriatrics doesn’t even appear on the menu of required training. The National Institutes of Health mandated the inclusion of women and people of color in medical research in 1986, but it didn’t issue a similar mandate for elders until 33 years later, in 2019. “The bias is so implicit, it goes unnoticed,” one of my colleagues said of ageism in the American COVID-19 response and in medicine generally. But when you start to pay attention, you see it everywhere.\nRead: How the pandemic will end\nTake for example, the way my state tracks deaths from the flu, one of the most common and deadly infections. Even though older people are far more likely to die from it, until 2018, the California Department of Public Health counted flu deaths only for children and adults under 65. The main explanation given to theSan Francisco Chroniclewas that recording the far higher number of elder deaths would be too expensive and time-consuming. The problem is that when the impact of disease in a population is unknown, there’s little incentive to develop treatments tailored to that group’s needs. When the affected population is elders, the problem is especially bad: As we’ve already seen with the current crisis, many people say that elders are dying anyway and tend to blame old age itself for their deaths—not a flawed system."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/getting-more-doctors-working-where-needed-11587059351", "title": "Getting More Doctors Working Where Needed", "text": "- Opinion\n- Letters\nGetting More Doctors Working Where Needed\nIt is clear that we need many more doctors trained in multiple specialties to ensure that we are prepared for the next public health emergency.\nYour editorial “Doctors Without State Borders” (April 11) appropriately uses the Covid-19 crisis to point out the nation’s outdated medical-resident cap policy and the importance of strong federal support for training the next generation of physicians.

When might a vaccine be ready? Find out here\nCoronavirus Covid-19 has now spread to six continents – only Antarctica is currently free of infections – and has triggered more than 85,000 cases of respiratory illness, of which nearly 3,000 have been fatal. The spread of the disease, which first emerged in Hubei province in central China at the beginning of 2020, has also triggered widespread financial alarm over the past week, with stock markets suffering their worst week since the global financial crisis of 2008.\nCovid-19 is now an epidemic in many parts of the globe and is destined to have a major impact on the health of the planet. Here we answer some key questions about the disease and its likely effects.\nMost doctors had been expecting the next major viral outbreak to involve a strain of flu. In what ways does Covid-19 differ from the influenza virus?\nBoth Covid-19 and influenza are respiratory illnesses and are spread by exhaled droplets which can survive in the air and on surfaces for short times. However, this strain of the coronavirus produces a fever and a dry cough but does not trigger runny noses or sneezing, as commonly occurs with flu.\nSo what is the best protection against picking up the virus? In particular, how useful are face masks?\nDoctors say that there is little evidence that masks protect wearers from infection. Instead they recommend that people wash their hands regularly, clean work surfaces and door handles, and try to avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth.\nWhat plans have been prepared to contain a possible epidemic of Covid-19 in the UK?\nA major fear is that rapidly growing numbers of infected individuals could overwhelm hospitals and general practitioners’ surgeries as the virus spreads and people become increasingly worried that they may be infected. Care of individuals in hospitals with other serious conditions could be affected. As a result, plans have been set up to “engineer the epidemic” by quarantining cases and attempting to limit the numbers of infected people coming into contact with uninfected individuals. This would slow down the disease’s spread. Cases of Covid-19 would then appear over a longer period of time and would not abruptly trigger chaos at hospitals.\nWhen might we expect a vaccine to be ready?\nResearchers have already begun work on a vaccine, but few believe one will be ready for at least another year. Certainly it will be too late to help deal with any UK epidemic that may emerge in the next few weeks.\nWill it be possible to eradicate Covid-19, or could it reappear regularly in future?\nThe World Health Organization and the Chinese government both say it will be possible to eradicate the virus. Not every scientist agrees, however. “I would not be surprised if we now have a virus that we will have to deal with forever,” says Prof Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University. “However, in such cases the first major outbreak is always the worst one. After that it should settle down and become part of a regular repertoire of winter viruses, I would imagine.”\nIs it possible the warmer weather may bring relief?\nSome observers have pointed to the fact that Africa has relatively few cases of Covid-19 and that this may be a response to hotter conditions there. The virus cannot take the heat, in other words.\nMost scientists counsel caution, however. “The disease has only just arrived in Africa and it is far too early to tell how it will behave there,” says Woolhouse. “We will just have to wait and see.”\nWhat are your chances of surviving if you become infected?\nMost figures suggest that around 1% to 2% of people will die after being infected with Covid-19, though that figure could decline as more and more cases in a region are recognised. Scientists are also clear about those who are most at risk from Covid-19: at the moment, it appears that the elderly are most at risk."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51481210", "title": "Britain race to contain the coronavirus", "text": "Britain's race to contain the coronavirus\nThere were 12 days between Steve Walsh leaving a business conference in Singapore and finding out he had been infected with the new coronavirus. When he was tested, he did not even have any symptoms.\nBut it was still enough to set in train a series of events that have left health officials battling to stop the disease - now named Covid-19 - from spreading across the UK.\nThe 53-year-old had stopped over for four days at a French ski resort to see friends on his way back from the business conference. Unbeknown to him, he was spreading the virus as he went.\nBy the time he alerted the NHS and Public Health England (PHE), after being contacted by Singaporean authorities about the spread of coronavirus at that conference, he had already passed it on to 11 other Britons at the resort.\nFive of them were also back in the UK by this stage - and two were GPs.\nBetween the six of them, they had come into contact with hundreds of people around Brighton and East and West Sussex before being isolated, giving the virus a real opportunity to get a foothold in the UK and marking the first major test of PHE's infection containment plans.\nMr Walsh, of course, was not the first person in the UK to have been diagnosed with the virus. But the previous two - both Chinese nationals who were in York - had had limited contact with others.\nThe race to contain the virus\nPHE's containment strategy was quickly put into action in both cases. Local PHE staff - there are nine teams across England - were sent to interview the confirmed cases to quickly piece together their movements.\nIt is a process being repeated in London following confirmation of the ninth UK case, a Chinese national.\nThis is called contact-tracing and has meant scores of people are being asked to isolate themselves at home. This self-isolation - different from the quarantining of British nationals repatriated from China - lasts until it is clear they are not going to get ill, which can take two weeks.\nThe hope is this stops the further spread of the virus - because there is no vaccine or cure, containment is the only option.\n- Coronavirus: How worried should we be?\n- 'If someone coughs, it makes me nervous'\n- China and the virus that threatens everything\nThe rough rule of thumb means anyone who has had physical contact with the carriers or spent 15 minutes within 6ft (2m) of them is contacted and self-isolation considered.\nThat includes people who were within two rows of them on the flights into the UK and, in the case of Mr Walsh, bar staff in pubs where he had stopped for a drink and members of a yoga class he had taken part in.\nFor the doctors - both GPs by training - it has involved patients.\nBetween them, they had done shifts at an accident and emergency unit and two GP practices as well as carrying out a visit to a nursing home.\nThe fact doctors have become infected is, in many respects, the \"worst-case scenario\" for health officials as the virus is known to be most risky to the frail and vulnerable.\nThe only silver lining, according to those involved in the hunt for contacts, is they do not seem to have treated that many patients.\nPHE believes only about a dozen people were seen by the two doctors during the shifts they did. At one practice, the GP only did paperwork.\nThose patients and many others now face an anxious wait to find out if they have been infected. The standard procedure is to wait to see if symptoms develop before testing - a negative test during the pre-symptomatic phase can be misleading.\nBut many in East and West Sussex have already been tested - as have others across the UK who have come in on flights from China, including those in quarantine in Milton Keynes and Merseyside, and those who had contact with the Chinese nationals in York. In total, more than 1,700 tests have been carried out.\nHas the virus been contained?\nPHE medical director Paul Cosford says the system of contact-tracing, isolation and testing is the best way of stopping the spread of the coronavirus.\nHe describes it as \"incredibly robust\" as shown by the fact the other Britons infected by Mr Walsh were found through the contact-tracing process\n\"That suggests it is working. If we can identify cases early, we can stop the spread.\"\nBut is this really realistic? At Britain's airports, flights coming in from at-risk countries, which include Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand, are being closely monitored.\nPassengers are warned about which symptoms to look out for and given leaflets on what to do if they develop them, while captains have to sign declarations no-one is known to be ill on their flights.\nProf Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease expert from Imperial College London, says despite this, it will not be possible to catch every case, predicting that, for every one that gets caught, another two could slip through.\nThose in the business refer to it as fires and sparks. Each carrier is a fire letting off sparks that may generate other fires. If those fires are detected, they can be isolated before letting off too many sparks.\nBut if they are not, the sparks breed new fires, leading to the risk of rapid sustained transmission.\nA long way to go yet\nMinisters and senior officials involved in containing coronavirus accept more UK cases will be likely, including, perhaps, transmission within the UK rather than just cases imported from abroad.\nThat in itself will not spell the end of the attempts to contain it. It is only when there are five, six or seven links in the chain of transmission that health officials would concede containment is no longer realistic and instead focus all efforts on NHS contingency planning to cope with the surge in patients that would follow.\nAt the moment, there is only one link in the chain - Mr Walsh to the others on the ski holiday.\nIf containment fails - and chief medical officer Prof Chris Witty is adamant that is still an if, not a when - then the longer it can be delayed the better position the UK will be in because more would be understood about the way the way the virus works and there is hope that in warmer weather it may be harder for it to spread.\nThe biggest concern now in the UK and abroad is what will happen if the virus starts spreading rapidly in nations other than China in the coming weeks.\nWorld Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this would have the potential to \"create havoc\".\nThis is because countries with weak health systems would find it more difficult to contain the spread and the nature of global travel and movement means even countries with sophisticated and developed surveillance systems would find it difficult to keep the virus at bay.\nThere promises to be many weeks of hard work ahead both here and abroad in the fight to contain it."}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/us-approves-45-minute-coronavirus-test/a-52875845", "title": "US approves 45 - minute coronavirus test | News | DW", "text": "As the US faces a shortage of coronavirus tests, a new test to be used mainly in hospitals and emergency rooms was approved.

Japanese health officials who were on board the ship were not tested afterwards.\nThe Olympic games must go on\nIt seems Abe and his cabinet were jolted into action after the Canadian vice president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Dick Pound, recently said that Japan has until the end of May to decide whether to go ahead with hosting the summer Olympic Games in Tokyo.\nDelaying the games, which are due to begin on July 24, would be out of the question due to television rights and athletes' schedules, said Pound.\nRead more: Could Japan call off Tokyo Olympics over coronavirus fears?\nFollowing the IOC's announcement, Abe jumped into action and began to call off or postpone big public events taking place during the next two weeks. 14 days is the virus' incubation period.\nNow businesses are calling off conferences and trade fairs, museums are closing and sporting events are being canceled.\nOn the same day Abe made these announcements, Japan's Olympic chief, Toshiro Muto, ensured that the games would take place. The torch relay across Japan will start as planned on March 26 in Fukushima, he said.\nIOC President Thomas Buch told Japanese media that the committee is \"fully committed\" to beginning the games on time.\nMore cases than reported?\nDespite the positive response of the IOC, the rapid spread of the disease COVID-19 around the world has raised concerns internationally as to whether Japan is doing enough to counter the virus.\nAlthough there are cases spread across the country, the numbers of new cases are hardly increasing. This has raised suspicions that the reported cases are only the tip of the iceberg.\n\"For every person who tested positive, there are probably hundreds of untested people with mild symptoms,\" Masahiro Kami, head of the Medical Governance Institute in Tokyo, told Bloomberg news.\nRead more: Coronavirus: Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers disembark as deaths hit 2,000\nThis is because, unlike in South Korea, there is hardly any testing taking place in Japan. One reason is that potentially ill patients must meet several conditions, such as a prolonged fever, in order to be tested.\nThese criteria are most likely in place to prevent panic, protect the healthcare system and save costs.\nSome hospitals have refused requests for tests, fearing that they will have to quarantine patients.\nJapan's Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told Parliament that between February 18 and 23, only 5,700 COVID-19 tests were carried out, including those on the cruise ship.\nEducation officials disagree\nOpposition parties have been criticizing Abe's wavering crisis management and closing schools could show that Abe is willing to be decisive.\nHowever, due to the move, many parents are now being forced to take time off work to take care of their children. Many people have taken to Twitter and criticized Abe. He has also caused anger and confusion within the ranks of his own party. Education Ministry officials said the decision was a bad idea.\n\"Who will take care of the younger elementary school children? A nationwide school closure poses so many problems that it cannot possibly be an option,\" said an outraged senior official, adding that Abe has not provided a convincing medical justification for the school closures.\n\"He wants to regain lost confidence in his role as a crisis manager,\" said political analyst Maslow.\nSome observers have compared the lack of action by Abe's government to the handling of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, which forced then Prime Minister Naoto Kan to resign.\nIt looks like Abe now wants to avoid this fate. However, his unexpected turnaround in policy is threatening to raise the level of panic.\nDW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

And if anybody thinks it wasn’t blown out of the sky, you’re 100 percent wrong, folks, OK? You’re 100 percent wrong.” (Naturally, French authorities later determined that the crash arose from a mechanical problem.)\nThey ended with installment #152, just before the election, at the time when James Comey’s last-minute reopening of the Hillary Clinton email case was dominating headlines. In between there were installments about Paul Manafort’s fishy-looking role, the “grab ‘em by...” moment, Trump’s comments about the “Mexican judge,” and the shift of one-time Trump ridiculers like Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell into a Vichy Republican coalition.\nThrough all the posts, the idea was to record in real time what people knew about Donald Trump, about the country, and about the issues and stakes in the election,beforeany of us knew how the contest was going to turn out. As I wrote in introducing the very first installment four years ago:\nPeople will wonder about America in our time. It can be engrossing to look back on dramatic, high-stakes periods in which people werenot yet surewhere things would lead, to see how they assessed the odds before knowing the outcome. The last few months of the 1968 presidential campaign: would it be Humphrey, Nixon, or conceivably even George Wallace? Or 1964: was there a chance that Goldwater might win? The impeachment countdown for Richard Nixon, in 1974? The Bush-Gore recount watch in 2000?\nThe Trump campaign this year will probably join that list. The odds are still against his becoming president, but no one can be sure what the next five-plus months will bring. Thus for time-capsule purposes, and not with the idea that this would change a single voter’s mind, I kick off what I intend as a regular feature. Its purpose is to catalogue some of the things Donald Trump says and does that no real president would do.\nWe are again in anot yet suremoment.\n- About the upcoming election.\n- About the unfolding-by-the-minute consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.\n- About the recent collapse of the stock markets, and the less immediately visible, but ultimately far more damaging, economic and social effects of the sudden simultaneous collapse of the travel and lodging industries, of the live-events and sports and conference and entertainment businesses, of restaurants and bars, of taxis and trains, of stores in college towns, and of the impact of all of this on the people who unload baggage from airliners or clean rooms for hotel guests or work as security guards at museums or sell jerseys at baseball games. Such roles are not as resonant as “steelworkers” or “coal miners” in political or journalistic discourse, but these jobs collectively form a very large part of the economy, they’re very hard to do over the internet or “remotely,” and they’re being eliminated at a pace not seen in at least a dozen years, and probably since the 1930s.\nWe don’t know.\nSo behind our veil of ignorance about outcomes, this is another chronicle of what we knew and heard day by day, which I’ll intend to operate, as with the original series, through the upcoming election season.\nObviously I am skipping through what would be several decades’ worth of news in normal circumstances: impeachment, the Democratic primaries, the evisceration of legal norms, and so on down a long list.\nInstead, for an arbitrary starting point, let’s begin with Trump’s Oval Office address last night on the virus threat. I have experience with this rhetorical form: I wrote a number of such addresses long ago when Jimmy Carter was president, and I have studied dozens of them in the intervening years.\nThis latest Trump speech was uniquely incompetent and inappropriate, and it’s worth noting why, as American voters decide whether to retain him in office.\nOne audience that Trump himself takes seriously—the world financial system—obviously took a dim view of his statement, as markets around the world headed sharply downward practically as soon as he began to talk. Of course, their view indirectly affects everyone else.\nBut from a political, rhetorical, and civic perspective, what was wrong with the speech? While watching it, I was assessing the speech by two standards: What it showed about Trump and his styles of thought, and what it showed about presidents and their roles in similar moments of stress.\nAs for Trump himself, his public vocabulary is strikingly limited on a deployable-word-count basis: “Many people are saying,” “it’s the greatest ever,” “we have tremendous people,” “very good things are happening,” “there has never been anything like it,” and of course “sir.”\nEqually striking is the consistency, or narrowness, of the messages Trump delivers. A huge proportion of his entire discourse can be boiled down to two themes:\n- I am so great, and am doing a better job than anyone else ever has. (Biggest crowds, best economy, most loyal supporters, etc.)\n- Other people are such cheaters—and it is outrageous what they are trying to get away with. (They’re sending rapists; they’re behind on their NATO payments; they’re ripping us off in trade; etc.)\nI won’t go through the whole classification of his discourse into these two categories, but nearly everything he said last night could be boiled down to one or the other of those themes.\n- I am so great and am doing the best possible job. (“This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history … Our team is the best anywhere in the world … Because of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world, by far.”)\n- Other people are mistreating us and are to blame. (Repeated references to the “foreign virus,” banning entry from most foreign nationals who have recently been in Europe, etc.)\nOf course, every presidential address in every era has implicitly argued,I am doing a good job. Whether the challenge they’re dealing with is the Great Depression or the 9/11 attacks, Pearl Harbor or the Cuban Missile Crisis, when describing the challenge and their intended response, all presidents are effectively saying:You can feel better about this emergency, because I have a plan.\nBut until Trump, other presidents have applied the “show, don’t tell” policy when it comes to their own competence. They want to show they are acting the way the country would hope, so they don’t have to say it.\nTrump says it himself. He quotes other people saying it about him. And he insists on hearing about his greatness from his retinue—most recently in the fawning statements made by his own vice president and secretary of health and human services, who preface their updates about the virus with North Korean-style compliments for the leader’s far-sighted action.\nFive years into Trump’s presence as a foreground political figure, many listeners are inured to the two unvarying notes in his presentations: that what is good has come from him, and what is bad has come from someone else. But the prominence of these two notes in an Oval Office address was a reminder of how much we have learned to overlook. This is not how presidents have ever talked before.\nAnd what about the speech, just as a speech? In my view it had three problems: how it was conceived; how it was written; and how it was delivered. (Plus, a bonus fourth problem I’ll get to at the end.)\nHow it was conceived: An Oval Office address is by definition about a big problem. (Otherwise, why is a president imposing on our time this way?) And its purpose is to answer several explicit questions:Why did this happen? How bad is it? What are we going to do about it?It also, always, must answer a deeper, broader, and more important question:Will we be OK?\nAbraham Lincoln’s First and Second Inaugural Addresses can be thought of as precursors to Oval Office addresses of the broadcast era, and as the ideal form of such speeches, answering all these questions. (Why did this happen? “In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war…. You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the Government, while I shall have the most solemn one to ‘preserve, protect, and defend’ it.”Will we be OK? “With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in..”)\nAgain, that’s the ideal form, but it is one that other presidents have had in mind as the model to work toward. These addresses have been aboutus, the American family, not aboutme, the leader. But Trump has only themenote in his vocal and emotional range, except forthemas the enemies. He used the wordusin the speech, but it was just a word. Audiences swallow a lot of guff from politicians, entertainers, and other public figures. But over time, the public can size up its most familiar performers and recognize which words ring true to them, and which they’re just reading from a script.\nAnd this is entirely apart from the speech’s failure to address the major elephant-in-the-room questions reporters, governors, and public health officials had been asking. Starting with,Why are we so far behind with tests?\nHow it was written:It was written badly.\nHow it was delivered:Donald Trump is very effective and entertaining as an unscripted live performer, riffing and feeding off the energy of a crowd. Why does he keep going to big rallies? Partly because the crowds adore him there, and partly because this is what he’s genuinely good at. His rallies—part greatest-hits, part “you have to be there to believe it!” surprises—are great shows. That’s how he commanded so much free airtime on cable TV through 2015 and early 2016: it was the latest must-watch reality show.\nBut you can’t do that in every speech. And while Trump can still slip a little bit of his rally-meister style into an hour-long State of the Union address, it’s just impossible in 10 minutes behind theResolutedesk. And thus he seemed robotic, even narcotized. Presumably he had seen the text before he encountered it on the TelePrompter—in normal circumstances, a president would have done practice run-throughs many times before the cameras came on. But to judge from his delivery, he was trying to parse his way through sentences he had never seen before. If this seems harsh, compare George W. Bush’s Oval Office address after the 9/11 attacks, or Ronald Reagan’s in 1986 on defense spending and arms-limitation talks.\nBonus: Within an hour of Trump’s speech, other parts of the government were issuing “clarifications” about points he had misstated in his speech. No, not all travel from Europe was suspended. No, the European transit ban did not apply to cargo. No, Americans coming back didn’t need to be screened before reentry. And no, on other points.\nHad the need for immediate fact-checking arisen, withanyprevious Oval Office address? Not that I am aware of. Whatever political party holds the White House and whatever policies these speeches seek to advance, such addresses usually reflect the greatest level of attention to detail that a president’s team can apply. Unfortunately, it probably did so in this case, too.\nTwelve hours after Trump’s speech, Joe Biden gave an address that was “presidential,” by the standards listed above. It expressed concern for those suffering in medical, financial, or emotional ways. It laid out what was known and unknown about the challenge. Implicitly, it argued:We will be OK.\nWhat the contrast between the speeches means, politically or in terms of public health, we don’t know at this moment. As of this installment, we know that Donald Trump faced a familiar test of presidential mettle, and badly failed.\nMore, and shorter, time capsules ahead."}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/house_sales_and_mortgage_applications_fall_but_prices_and_rents_stay_the_same/11281565", "title": "House sales and mortgage applications fall but prices and rents stay the same", "text": "House sales and mortgage applications fall but prices and rents stay the same\nHalf of agents report a drop in property transactions during the coronavirus crisis, but prices so far unaffected and may even rise, says one industry insider.\nHousehunter Irina Karppinen rubs sanitiser on her hands as she steps into a showing at a property for sale in Nuottaniemi in Espoo, in the search for a new house for her three-person family.\n“We're most likely going to have to put our plans on ice, at least for now.

Japanese officials in protective suits have brought fresh supplies on board. No passengers are permitted to disembark. Some 3,700 holidaymakers and crew have been quarantined since an 80-year-old passenger, who left the ship in Hong Kong, tested positive for the new coronavirus sweeping China. Since then, 218 of those on board have been infected. Any infection spreads rapidly on such vessels so passengers are mostly confined to their cabins. Some are relying on sudoku puzzles delivered to their rooms by staff for entertainment. Others have had wine delivered by drone. All are anxiously counting the days until February 19th, when their two weeks of isolation should end.\nMost confirmed infections of covid-19, as the World Health Organisation has just renamed the disease, are in China. But the disease is now spreading throughout Asia. Singapore confirmed its first infection on January 23rd. It has since detected 49 more. The first 14 identified had all travelled there from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began. The first cases of local transmission, traced to a traditional medicine shop frequented by Chinese tourists, were announced on February 4th.\nThe arrival of the new coronavirus in the city-state was predictable. China is Singapore’s largest trading partner. But it is spreading elsewhere. Japan says 28 people have been infected—not including those confined to the Diamond Princess. Thailand has identified more than 30 and Malaysia 18. Along with Singapore they have all confirmed cases of local transmission. So has Vietnam, where 16 people have caught the disease and 10,000 have been quarantined. In the Philippines one person has died—one of two known deaths outside mainland China. Laos and Myanmar, which share long land borders with China, say they are dealing with only a few suspected cases, though the numbers will surely rise. Armed insurgent groups in Myanmar, such as the Kachin Independence Organisation, have launched public-health campaigns promoting handwashing.\nOthers insist they are unaffected by the virus. Indonesia, with its 6,000 inhabited islands and 267m people, denies it has a single case. That would be surprising (see chart), given that 2m Chinese tourists visit every year. Some 5,000 Chinese visitors to Bali extended their stay there, fearful of returning home and exposing themselves to the virus. Amin Soebandrio, director of the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology in Jakarta, maintains that the country is more than able to detect anyone infected. And yet 238 Indonesians who were evacuated from Wuhan were quarantined but not tested for covid-19. The health ministry said that this was because the arrivals appeared healthy and the tests are expensive.\nExperts suspect there are many more infections than have been reported. “Any country that has significant travel back and forth with China and hasn’t found cases should be concerned,” cautions Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University. Covid-19 has arrived in Singapore; it would be foolish to think that it has not spread more widely, he says.\nThe disease has killed over 1,300 people and infected around 60,000 in China (there is great uncertainty over the totals). It seems to be transmitted through droplets from coughs and sneezes, and mostly as a result of close contact with someone who is already ill. But experts fear that some people with no symptoms could infect others. Tracing the contacts of those who have been infected is like “looking through the dark”, says Oshitani Hitoshi, an expert in infectious diseases at Tohoku University in Japan. Rich countries such as Singapore are particularly well placed to monitor and care for those who are ill and people in contact with them. But poorer countries with weaker health systems will struggle.\nSingapore has prepared for an outbreak of this kind since SARS caught Asia unawares in 2003. The country has raised its outbreak alert to orange, the second-highest threat level. It has barred those who have been to China in the past 14 days from entering the country. Quarantine awaits anyone who has been in close contact with an infected individual. And people entering hospitals and offices must have their temperature taken first. Inter-school sports fixtures have been cancelled until the end of March. The largest dormitory for migrant workers in the country stands ready if any of its occupants need to be quarantined. Pink pillows lie on single beds, empty so far, widely spaced to ensure that any patients are more than two metres apart in designated rooms. Singapore is using a tough new law against fake news to try to prevent the spread of inaccurate information, such as a rumour that the country has run out of face masks.\nJapan is taking many similar steps. The government is scared that the virus might wreck the Olympic Games in Tokyo this summer. Earlier this month it banned foreigners who had visited Hubei, the province in China where the outbreak originated, and those with passports issued there, from entering Japan. The country’s two biggest airlines have stopped all flights to Beijing from one of Tokyo’s international airports and halved their flights from another.\nSo far India has detected cases only in Kerala. This may be because Kerala is the Indian state with the strongest health-care system, so cases there are more likely to be detected. Infections elsewhere may simply not have been noticed yet. However, India’s government has been quick to react. It was among the first countries to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan and is monitoring almost 10,000 people for covid-19. Also, India is less well connected to China than air hubs such as Singapore and Thailand, and its relative isolation may protect it somewhat. Indeed, it has sent medical equipment including masks and protective clothing to China. The government has, however, also claimed that ayurvedic remedies and homeopathy could help manage the disease, suggestions for which evidence is entirely lacking. Meanwhile Pakistan has told its citizens in Wuhan to stay put. Its health system is already strained and China is one of its most vital allies.\nAll countries must balance their fear of the human and economic costs of the virus against the damage caused by measures to contain it. For less well-off countries, the trade-off is especially painful. Tourism generates more than a tenth of Thailand’s GDP. In 2018 about a quarter of the 38m holidaymakers who visited the country were Chinese. In desperation, Thailand has neither restricted Chinese tourists from entering the country nor stopped giving them free visas on arrival.\n“We wish to reaffirm our solidarity with the people of China and wish you every success in overcoming this grave situation,” wrote King Maha Vajiralongkorn in a message to China’s leader, Xi Jinping. Hun Sen, the president of Cambodia, where China has invested more money than any other country in recent years, went further. He travelled to Beijing to meet Mr Xi, demonstrating his loyalty in the face of adversity.\nChina’s embassies have attacked foreign governments for imposing travel bans. Its ambassador in Jakarta warned Indonesia that “overreaction” would have “a direct impact” on relations. But such bullying may not work. Covid-19 comes after a devastating outbreak of African swine flu on Chinese pig farms and amid a trade war between China and America, and protracted protests in Hong Kong. These upheavals have dented China’s reputation in the region. The epidemic has exposed China as a country of great strengths and weaknesses, says Bilahari Kausikan, a Singaporean former diplomat: “Quite a lot of the gloss has worn off the Chinese story.” ■\nThis article appeared in the International section of the print edition under the headline \"Curbing the Asian contagion\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/opinion/coronavirus-schools-closed.html", "title": "Opinion | Coronavirus School Closings : Dont Wait Until It Too Late", "text": "[This article is part of the developing coronavirus coverage, and may be outdated. Go here for the latest on the coronavirus.]\nMy research on the long history of epidemics has taught me that when it comes to outbreaks of contagious respiratory infections, closing schools can help prevent many thousands of illnesses and deaths.\nSchools are community gathering places where large numbers of people are in proximity to one another and respiratory infections can easily spread among young people and adults alike. Shutting them down can be a key part of slowing the spread of easily transmissible viruses so that hospitals are not overrun with sick people, and it can help to buy time to allow for the development of antiviral medications, medical treatments or a vaccine.\nBut policymakers working to stop the spread of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 should remember a key part of this historically informed equation: We can’t wait until it’s too late.\nCommunities in the United States must shut down schools before, not after, the outbreak becomes widespread here. “Widespread” is admittedly an imprecise term, but I use it to describe a situation in which there are multiple cases throughout a town or state and more cases with each passing day.\nIn 2007, my colleagues and I at the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied the 1918-19 influenza pandemic, which killed up to 750,000 Americans.\nWe looked at 43 large cities that carried out some combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs): isolating the ill or those suspected of being ill in hospitals or at home; banning public gatherings; in some cases, shutting down roads and railways; and closing schools.\nSchool closing turned out to be one of the most effective firewalls against the spread of the pandemic; cities that acted fast, for lengthy periods, and included school closing and at least one other NPI in their responses saw the lowest death rates.\nOf course, all NPIs are socially disruptive and should be used only as a last resort, to control infections that are highly transmissible and dangerous, and have high fatality rates. The primary problem with the new coronavirus is that we have never before experienced an outbreak with it, so we do not yet have good, stable numbers to tell us how serious it is.\nBased upon the assumption “that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases,” experts at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases are predicting that Covid-19’s case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1 percent. While that is higher than the rate for seasonal flu (0.1 percent), it’s much lower than the staggering rate we saw in the 1918 influenza pandemic (2.5 percent in the United States, and in some nations higher). It may even fall lower once we have a better sense of the number of mild cases. If this happens and most cases of Covid-19 turn out to be no worse than a nasty but not deadly bout of flu, NPIs like school closings won’t be necessary.\nBut this kind of data might not be available for analysis until Covid-19 has already spread widely. So for now, policies to contain it should be influenced by the adage “better safe than sorry.” There’s no room for the public to grouse about calls made too early.\nAfter all, it’s easy to reopen schools if the news is good. For example, my colleagues and I observed the use of school closings and other NPIs during the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic. During the first days of the outbreak in Mexico, the Health Ministry conducted a broad-based and exacting group of NPIs, similar to the ones we found worked in 1918. The measures appeared to contain the spread of influenza but were revoked 18 days later after it became clear that the H1N1 influenza virus was widespread but not all that deadly.\nOn the other hand, we studied the use of 559 school closings in Michigan during the fall wave of the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic. Eighty-three percent of those closings occurred long after the virus had reached its peak week of infection and had already spread widely among people living in those school districts. The results were all too predictable: The late, reactive school closings had little effect on levels of influenza-like illnesses.\nThere’s no reason to close schools in communities that have not yet seen Covid-19. But that situation could change quickly, and when it does, school officials, public health agencies and municipal leaders will need to be ready to make the tough call of shutting the schools down. School officials should be checking C.D.C. guidance daily, if not hourly.\nIn another study, my colleagues and I looked at the spring wave of the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic across the United States and found that because of confusion over the advice given by the C.D.C., many school districts closed too late or did not close at all. And of course, when the flu came to these towns, it did what an influenza virus always does: It spread. Good, frequent communication among decision makers will be crucial to avoiding this kind of mishap.\nIn the meantime, employers ought to develop policies allowing parents to stay at home with their children and not be penalized.\nAgain, there’s no agreed-upon scenario that determines exactly when to make the school-closing call. But if there is an outbreak of several cases of the coronavirus among, say, a class of third graders in one elementary school, an immediate school closing — including the schools of those third graders’ siblings and other kids with whom they’ve had contact — would be a good idea.\nSome schools have already shut down. A district near Seattle canceled classes after a parent volunteer tested positive for Covid-19. A school in White Plains, N.Y., did the same after three children enrolled there tested positive. These were rational choices that seem to have been accepted by parents.\nTo be sure, more than 80 percent of the Covid-19 cases reported so far have been mild, and few children have been among the people suffering from serious or deadly cases. But most parents would tolerate the inconvenience of school closings if it meant they were avoiding even a relatively small risk to their child’s health. Just as important, children of all ages are especially good at spreading respiratory viruses, which puts adults who work in schools as well as health workers in emergency rooms and hospitals at risk if schools remain open. Keeping kids at home could be an important part of saving lives.\nIn the history of medicine, we have never been more prepared to confront this virus than we are today. But this history also teaches us that when it comes to school closings, we must always be ready to act today — not tomorrow.\nDr. Markel is the director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan and a professor of pediatrics.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/business/billionaire-s-fund-pershing-square-makes-most-of-hedging-its-bets-crlbfjctz", "title": "Billionaire fund Pershing Square makes most of hedging its bets | Business", "text": "Billionaire’s fund Pershing Square makes most of hedging its bets\nBill Ackman has warned that global stock markets still have further to fall, despite Monday’s bruising sell-off.

But preparations for a COVID-19 epidemic in the European nation are already underway.\nDo official figures from China accurately reflect the number of people infected by coronavirus? How is the new virus transmitted? And how can an impending pandemic be contained?\nLeading German scientists answered some central questions about the latest coronavirus to sweep across the globe, dubbed COVID-19, at an information event organized by the Science Media Center and the National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in Berlin.\nThe virus replicates like the influenza virus in the throat, explained virologist Christian Drosten from the Charité University hospital Berlin, which makes it more contagious than initially suspected.\nDespite recent reports that pangolins are likely to be the intermediate host of the virus (which is thought to have originated in bats), Drosten said the exact origin of the virus may never be established.\nIt is possible, he argued, that the virus was first transmitted to humans somewhere in China before it was spread at the live animal market in Wuhan, where the first cases were reported.\nDisease spread\nAccording to Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), previous data indicates that COVID-19 has a similar impact to a severe wave of influenza.\nChina is taking drastic measures to prevent the spread of the virus beyond its borders, but all the chains of the infection globally have all been linked in some way to China.\nRead more: Opinion: Caution justified when it comes to coronavirus\nTaking temperature measurements and wearing face masks doesn't help, German health experts warn.\nContainment strategy\nThe containment efforts made so far in countries outside of China have been \"very, very successful,\" Wieler told event attendees. The doctors in countries outside China, including Germany, are trying to delay a possible wave of the disease. Their intention is to prevent a possible pandemic of COVID-19 from coinciding with the current wave of influenza.\n\"At some point, it will probably happen that unnoticed infections are suddenly detected,\" Drosten said, pointing out that the possibilities for containment are limited.\nWhen does it become a pandemic?\nAs all cases of the virus outside of China have so far been contained, COVID-19's spread across the globe can't yet be considered a \"pandemic.\"\nIn fact, it may never fulfil that criteria, said Wieler. \"The decisive characteristic [for a pandemic] is that it spreads to several continents,\" he said.\nAlthough cases of COVIC-19 have been diagnosed worldwide, none of the known infection chains have gotten out of control — all have been contained within the population.\nFigures and fatalities\nThe number of infectious cases being quoted by the Chinese government should be treated with caution, experts emphasized. \"They are trends,\" said Wieler. According to Drosten, the figures rather reflect the capacities of the reporting system, not the actual numbers, suggesting that many patients with symptoms are never actually registered.\nIn China, official statistics state the mortality rate is about 2%.\nBut among all of the cases detected and treated outside China, it's only 0.2%. This is probably due to the fact that only patients with severe symptoms are tested and treated in hospitals in China, Wieler said, pointing out that a more accurate figure is probably closer to 0.2% in China, as outside.\nDrosten emphasized that many sufferers of COVID-19 experience symptoms similar to a common cold or mild flu.\nOlder patients are more at risk and men are also more frequently affected than women. According to the experts, even people who experience few or no symptoms can infect others.\nIs Germany prepared?\nIf a wave of infection hit Germany, it would likely overburden the health authorities and lead to long waiting times in hospitals, Dorsten said.\nBut it isn't clear when such a wave would hit, or how intense it would be. In any case, thorough preparations are already underway, according to Charité CEO Heyo Kroemer. If an epidemic were to hit Germany, authorities could, for example postpone non-urgent operations to make room.\nAs for low income countries outside of Europe, Wieler said an additional pathogen would massivley challenge regional health systems. In preparation, partners in industrial nations have begun sending diagnostic material to lower income countries in the hope of significantly boosting diagnostic capabilities. International experts are also offering training for infection prophylaxis, especially in hospitals.\nRead more: How not to protect yourself from the coronavirus\nA spread of COVID-19 in Africa would put a huge burden on health care systems across the continent\nWho is to blame?\nDrosten stressed that the spread of a virus like COVID-19 is a natural phenomenon and that pointing the finger at those who are infected is innapropriate and unhelpful.\nWhat is important is bettering our understanding of the disease and learning how to protect people, he said, especially those who may have underlying diseases or compromised immune systems.\nThe experts made clear that, in general, thorough hand washing is a reliable precautionary measure, but wearing protective face masks is not, as the humidity generated from breathing renders the masks ineffective after only 20 minutes.\nOpen questions\nIt remains unclear how fast the virus is spreading and how many people, on average, an infected person can infect, Wieler said. If doctors knew that, more accurate predictions would be possible — including, for example, an understanding of whether the spread of the virus is likely to gradually roll out across the globe, or strike in waves.\nSince first cases were confirmed in December 2019, the flu-like 2019-nCoV virus exploded into a major health emergency, killing hundreds of people and infecting thousands more.

In early March, the 37-year-old writer F. T. Kola began to feel mildly ill, with a fever and body aches. To be safe, she isolated herself at home in San Francisco. Life continued apace for a week, until one day she tried to load her dishwasher and felt strangely exhausted.\nHer doctor recommended that she go to Stanford University’s drive-through coronavirus testing site. “I remember waiting in my car, and the doctors in their intense [protective equipment] coming towards me like a scene out of Contagion,” she told me when we spoke for The Atlantic’s podcast Social Distance. “I felt like I was a biohazard—and I was.” The doctors stuck a long swab into the back of her nose and sent her home to await results.\nLying in bed that night, she began to shake, overtaken by the most intense chills of her life. “My teeth were chattering so hard that I was really afraid they would break,” she said. Then she started to hallucinate. “I thought I was holding a very big spoon for some reason, and I kept thinking, Where am I going to put my spoon down?”\nAn ambulance raced her to the hospital, where she spent three days in the ICU, before being moved to a newly created coronavirus-only ward. Sometimes she barely felt sick at all, and other times she felt on the verge of death. But after two weeks in the hospital, she walked out.

A ship called Liza Destiny sits off the coast of Guyana, collecting the black stuff from wells on the seabed nearly 2km below. On Norway’s continental shelf the Johan Sverdrup project is ramping up faster than expected. In Texas some 174,000 wells are at work, from big shale operations to solitary pumpjacks nodding as cattle graze nearby. Last month Saudi Arabia said it would ship a staggering 12.3m barrels a day to customers in April. From the Niger delta to Siberia, oil continues to flow. The rest of the world, meanwhile, is standing still.\nIn recent years oil producers have faced a spectre of depressed demand that could up-end the industry. All of a sudden the wraith has materialised—not out of concern for the climate, as oilmen feared, but because of covid-19. Crude fuels the movement of people and goods around the world. A lot of this has stopped as governments limit travel and other economic activity to contain the pandemic. Oil demand has dipped in only two years of the past 35. In the first six months of 2020 it may plunge by more than 20%.\nIf that weren’t enough, a brawl between Saudi Arabia and Russia has led to a price war. The price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell by more than half in March, below $23 a barrel. The last time it was this cheap, in 1999, Britney Spears topped the charts and the dotcom bubble had not burst. As for the drop, “nothing like this has ever happened before,” says Daniel Yergin, a historian and vice-chairman of IHS Markit, a consultancy.\n…Baby, one more time\nSaudi Arabia and Russia were expected to discuss production cuts with other petrostates on April 9th, after The Economist went to press, then again at a G20 meeting the next day. Any deal is unlikely to end oversupply. Covid-19 is already exposing vulnerabilities of petrostates and oil firms. With prices poised to sink lower, the entire industry may be forever transformed.\nA few months ago demand was expected to rise modestly this year. But trouble festered. Surging production in Guyana, Norway and Brazil seemed sure to weigh on prices. More worrisome, the world’s energy powers were increasingly at odds. In 2016 Russia teamed up with the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, in an attempt to offset booming American shale production. This OPEC+ alliance proved both fractious and ineffectual. Russia regularly ignored the group’s self-imposed production limits, forcing Saudi Arabia to curb its own output more sharply. That pushed oil prices high enough to shore up investment in American shale but too low to balance the budgets of Saudi Arabia and other petrostates.\nAmerica, which in 2018 eclipsed Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world’s top oil producer (see chart 1), indeed looks like the main beneficiary of OPEC+. In an effort to snuff out shale Russia shocked OPEC in March by refusing further production cuts. Furious Saudis declared the price war in response.\nAmerican frackers and international oil giants had problems of their own. Even as shale production surged, shale firms’ valuations sank, with more investors sceptical of their ability to produce steady profits. Worries over climate change clouded the long-term prospects of supermajors such as ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell while other industries offered better short-term returns. Energy was the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 index in four of the past six years.\nThe oil market has witnessed big shocks before (see chart 2). In the late 1990s supply rose while a demand-sapping financial crisis rocked Asia. In 2014 the Saudis opened the taps in an attempt to drown American shale. But never before has anyone seen anything like covid-19. In the coming weeks crude will come perilously close to filling the capacity to store it. Citigroup, a bank, says that global supply needs to fall by 10m barrels a day, 12% of the total, for tanks not to spill over. Prices in parts of the world may fall below $10, says Goldman Sachs, another bank—or turn negative, as producers pay to have their oil taken away rather than shut in wells.\nWith OPEC+ in tatters and America’s shalemen clamouring for help, on April 2nd Donald Trump, who two days earlier welcomed cheap oil as a tax cut for American consumers, tweeted that a production deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia was imminent. This pushed Brent up by 20%, the biggest one-day gain since 1986.\nMr Trump wanted to support American oil companies further by buying their crude and storing it in the government’s strategic reserves. But he is not an autocrat presiding over a petrostate and his idea was rejected by Congress. Another of his suggestions, to levy a tariff on imported oil, might benefit some of America’s 9,000 or so oil and gas producers. But it would harm integrated giants such as ExxonMobil, which use heavier overseas crudes in their American refineries. Large companies also resist national production caps that would prop up smaller, less profitable rivals.\nSome petrostates have trouble grasping that Mr Trump cannot call oil bosses and tell them to do this or that, says Mr Yergin. But, he adds, the president does have “an enormous amount of influence”. If the government’s power over oil firms is limited, its control of aid is plainer. A group of American senators from oil-producing states have threatened to withhold military support for Saudi Arabia if it refuses to limit output.\nMr Trump may therefore help broker an agreement, particularly if armed with data showing that American companies are already cutting spending. However, continued animosity between Russia and Saudi Arabia, combined with instability within OPEC’s smaller members, will lead at best to temporary production deals of limited impact. Output cuts agreed now would take time to be felt in the physical market. Even a cut of 15m barrels a day—around ten times what the Saudis sought in March—would be dwarfed by covid-19’s obliteration of demand, of as much as 20m barrels a day in April. “We are not going to fully recover until we are through corona,” says Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, a powerful lobby group.\nEven then, it is unclear that the industry, in its current form, recovers at all. Russia is in a position of relative strength. It can balance its budget with oil at $42 a barrel and has more than $500bn in foreign reserves. Saudi Arabia has low operating costs of just $3.20 a barrel, about one-third of America’s, according to Rystad Energy, a consultancy. That would help it in a drawn-out battle for market share, though the current crisis has hit about a decade too soon for comfort—economic reforms to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil are a work in progress and the country still needs $84 a barrel to finance its budget.\nOther producers look more vulnerable. Low oil prices will tighten the vise on Iran and Venezuela, each already squeezed by American sanctions. In Iran deteriorating finances will make it even harder to deal with high rates of coronavirus transmission. Cheap oil will exacerbate strife in Libya and may feed unrest in Iraq, as well as Algeria. A few big projects in Africa require an oil price of $45 or more just to break even, reckons Rystad; many may now be put on hold. Listed oil giants are paring spending in an effort to protect dividends. ConocoPhillips has delayed drilling in Alaska. Chevron has cut its capital budget for this year by 20%.\nMore damage will come as low prices compel firms and governments not just to cancel new projects but mothball existing wells. That may hurt countries with high production costs, like Brazil and Britain.\nThe sudden plunge in demand means that shut-ins will depend as much on logistics as on production cost, argues Damien Courvalin of Goldman Sachs. As inland tanks fill, landlocked wells with limited access to storage and transport will suffer. Canadian crude has the double misfortune of being costly and hard to ship—on April 7th a barrel of Western Canadian Select fetched about $10, a third as much as Brent. Some inland American and Russian production may stop, too.\nOops…I did it again\nWhen the world economy begins to open up after the pandemic, it will find the oil industry looking different. In America less productive shale beds may be gone, finally “flushing out production that was never really warranted”, says Ed Morse of Citigroup. The number of shale bankruptcies jumped by 50% last year. In 2020 more inefficient companies will vanish. Some wells, once closed, are too costly to reopen. And with oil at $35 a barrel, the return on renewable projects—which most energy firms have largely ignored—can rival that of a new oilfield, notes Valentina Kretzschmar of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy.\nA sudden loss of production could, if demand picks up quickly, create an opportunity for more drilling. But investors may now be warier of oil companies’ spending plans. Especially if they suspect covid-19 fundamentally alters oil demand: more people may work remotely, a lot of international travel could come to be seen as unnecessary and companies may bring supply chains closer to home to avert disruptions. “Are we about to see a structural change in oil consumption?” wonders Mr Courvalin. “It is a very valid question.” Oilmen used to take comfort that it was an abstract one. No longer. ■\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus tracker and story hub\nThis article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline \"Upside down\""}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/29/how-can-you-prevent-yourself-from-getting-coronavirus", "title": "How can you prevent yourself from getting coronavirus ? ", "text": "Cases of coronavirus have spread to more than 80 countries, infecting more than 95,000 people worldwide and killing over 3,000 (by Friday March 6).\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus is thought to \"spread via respiratory droplets and exposure to human secretions, similar to the flu\", Tania Elliott, a clinical instructor of medicine at NYU Langone Health told Euronews.\nSo how can you protect yourself against the virus? Here is a break down of some expert tips on how to protect yourself.\nWash hands properly\nExperts say first and foremost that you should wash your hands properly.\nPeople often touch their faces and can transfer germs to their nose, mouth or eyes, causing illness.\nThe French health ministry recommends washing your hands for 30 seconds, \"by rubbing nails, fingertips, palm and the outside of the hands, knuckles and wrists\" in order to prevent viruses.\nThe US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that handwashing \"can prevent about 30% of diarrhoea-related sicknesses and about 20% of respiratory infections,\" citing two studies on the topic.\nThey say that educating the general population on handwashing can reduce respiratory illness by 16-21%.\n\"The main guidance for preventing coronavirus infection if you're an ordinary person is not to wear a mask but to wash your hands constantly\": Dr Leora Horwitz of New York University Langone Health. Watch the interview on Euronews Tonight in the video player above.\nThe World Health Organization recommends washing hands \"after coughing or sneezing, when caring for the sick, before, during and after you prepare food, before eating, after toilet use, when hands are visibly dirty and after handling animals or animal waste.\"\nIf you cannot wash your hands with soap, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser.\nYou should use a hand-sanitizer \"after touching subway poles, stairway bars, and water fountains,\" Elliott said.\nMinimise germ spread i.e. don't cough on other people\n\"There is no vaccine currently available, so we have to use what we call 'non-pharmaceutical measures', basically good hygiene and 'social distancing' (avoiding close contact with people who are sick, or with others, if you are sick yourself),\" Dr Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology from Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, told Euronews.\nThe World Health Organization says you should \"follow good respiratory hygiene\" around other people which includes covering your mouth with a tissue or your elbow. You should also dispose of used tissues.\nThe international body also suggests maintaining a distance of at least one metre between yourself and someone who might be sick to prevent potential virus-containing liquid droplets from coughs or sneezes from contaminating you.\nThey also suggest people try to avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth, which is a common way of contracting a virus.\nAt work, people should keep workplaces clean and practice \"regular and thorough\" handwashing.\n\"If you are sick, stay home,\" says Dr Tania Elliott at NYU.\nElliott adds that people should \"avoid finger foods or sandwich platters [and instead] opt for individually packaged items [as] it minimizes chances of germ spread\".\nReporting symptoms early\nIt's important for health workers to detect cases early, so if you've been in contact with someone with the virus or to a region affected, you should report your symptoms to a health professional.\n\"Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses,\" the World Health Organization says.\nMany cases of this virus have been mild, meaning that most people can self-isolate to treat the virus and consult with medical professionals without infecting others in a hospital.\nElliott proposes a \"telehealth visit over in-person care if you are feeling sick\" to help further limit infections.\nBut it's still a very small percentage of the world that has COVID-19, so although governments are working to contain further spread, most people with similar symptoms will have a common cold or flu.\nDo you need to start wearing a face mask?\nThe US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend that members of the general public wear a face mask.\n\"Face masks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others,\" the health body states.\nFrance's health minister Olivier Véran said that the country was taking millions of masks out of the national stock primarily for health professionals. He said that asymptomatic people did not need to wear masks.\n\"If you’re unwell and you wear a mask yes it can be effective because obviously, you’re not coughing into your hand, so you’re not going to shake someone else's hand... you interrupt that method of transmission,\" Dr Natalie MacDermott, a clinical lecturer at King’s College London, told Euronews last month.\nMasks to protect people from actually contracting the illness have to be biological grade masks, which are often pricey but other masks become damp as we breathe, and if someone were to cough on them, it could make matters worse, she added.\nSurgeons, for example, wear masks to protect their patients from germs, not to protect themselves.\n\"If an individual is infected...a face mask would help prevent transmission to others,\" said Jennifer Lighter, a hospital epidemiologist and assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. But \"there is no reason for the general population to wear face masks\", she said.\nPrepping for an outbreak\nMany virus prevention suggestions are \"good habits anyway, so a good idea to do this regularly,\" said Morse at the Mailman School of Public Health.\nHe said that depending on where you live, you may also want to stock up on essentials such as food and prescription medicines you may need.\n\"Otherwise, most homes already have much of what they need, such as cleaning supplies, soap, paper goods,\" he said.\nMany companies and countries are also recommending people limit non-essential travel to the areas worst affected by the virus outbreak including China, South Korea, and northern Italy."}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/12/greek-tourism-industry-hit-hard-by-cancellations-amid-coronavirus-outbreak", "title": "  Are there any Chinese there ?

The number of cases also increased sharply elsewhere in the region.\nQatar Airways, one of the Mideast’s biggest carriers, also said it was essentially halting operations to Iran and South Korea until further notice.\nHealth Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour confirmed Harirchi had the virus. Harirchi himself posted an online video saying he had it and that he had quarantined himself at home. He promised that authorities would bring the virus under control.\n“I wanted to tell you that, rest assured that with efforts of your servants at the Health Ministry ... and backed by you people, the government and all elements of the establishment, we will be victorious in our combat against this virus within the next few weeks,” Harirchi said.\nOn Monday, however, he had offered a far different assessment while repeatedly wiping his brow while standing beside government spokesman Ali Rabiei.\n“Currently the situation is almost stable in the country and we could manage to minimize the problem,” Harirchi said. He also said that “quarantines belong to the Stone Age.”\nThat optimism, while no longer held by Harirchi, also appeared to be undercut by Jahanpour himself on Tuesday. The Health Ministry spokesman suggested it may take at least until Nowruz, the Persian New Year on March 20, for Iran to reach a point where the virus was contained. He added that a more “pessimistic” assessment suggested Iran would contain it by late April.\n“We don’t expect a miracle in the short term,” Jahanpour said.\nA prominent pro-reform lawmaker, Mamoud Sadeghi of Tehran, also said in a tweet that he tested positive for the virus.\nThe coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people globally, causing about 2,700 deaths, mainly in China. The World Health Organization has named the illness COVID-19.\nJahanpour on Tuesday said 15 people had died in Iran so far amid 95 confirmed cases. However, experts remain concerned Iran may be underreporting cases and deaths, given the rapid spread from Iran across the Persian Gulf.\nA hard-line lawmaker in Iran alleged Monday there had been 50 deaths in the Iranian city of Qom alone, which was denied by authorities.\n“What do you have to say about those buried in Qom cemetery?” tweeted lawmaker Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani. “Practitioners in hospitals write ‘respiratory problems’ as the cause of death. But you know that they are from those quarantined for corona.”\nWhile Farahani’s politics make him eager to undercut moderate President Hassan Rouhani, his earlier warning that Qom’s top doctor fighting the coronavirus also had been infected has proven to be true.\nRouhani said he opposed closing public and government offices.\n“This is one of the plots by the enemy to shut down the country through spreading fear,” he said in a speech, although he also urged people to avoid crowds, including at major Shiite shrines.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. is “deeply concerned” that Iran “may have suppressed vital details about the outbreak.”\n“All nations, including Iran, should tell the truth about the coronavirus and cooperate with international aid organizations,” he said.\nThe UAE’s General Civil Aviation Authority said it would halt all flights to and from Iran. The announcement came hours after busy Dubai International Airport said there would be restrictions on flights there.\nThe UAE, home to long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad, remains a key international transit route for Iran’s 80 million people.\n“All passenger and cargo aircraft traveling to and from Iran will be suspended for a period of one week, and could be up for extension,” the authority said.\nPassengers on a Mahan Air flight from Tehran to Dubai on Tuesday said their flight was delayed some two hours, only to repeatedly circle the UAE city-state, then land and sit for another two hours before authorities agreed to let them off. The passengers, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution, said authorities let them walk off one at a time while being monitored with a thermal scanner.\nEmirates, the government-owned carrier based in Dubai, flies daily to Tehran. Its low-cost partner airline, FlyDubai, serves several Iranian cities, as does the Sharjah-based low-cost carrier Air Arabia.\nThe announcement came after Bahrain said it would suspend all flights from Dubai and Sharjah, a neighboring UAE emirate home to Air Arabia, for 48 hours. The small island nation off Saudi Arabia announced its first cases of the virus on Monday. By Tuesday, Bahrain said it had 23 confirmed cases.\nDubai had been screening passengers on flights from China, where the outbreak began in December. Emirates and Etihad still fly to Beijing as the UAE works to maintain close ties with China.\nAfghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq and Oman also announced their first cases of the virus Monday and connected them to travel with Iran. The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, has reported 13 cases of the virus. Most of those were connected to Chinese travel.\nAlso Tuesday, Kuwait raised the number of its infected cases from five to eight, according to the state-run KUNA news agency. It said the three latest cases involved Kuwaiti citizens just back from Iran. The five previously reported cases were passengers on a flight from the Iranian city of Mashhad, where Iran’s government has not yet announced a single case of the virus.\nIraq’s Health Ministry said four new cases of coronavirus were diagnosed in the northern province of Kirkuk. It said the afflicted were members of an Iraqi family who had returned recently from Iran. Iraq announced its first case Monday in the Shiite Muslim holy city of Najaf: an Iranian student who has since returned to Iran.\nThe northern region, which shares a border with Iran, is a hub of economic activity and the primary gateway for the Kurdistan Regional Government to import Iranian goods and fuel, and Kurds in Erbil lined up for gas, fearing shortages. The KRG also suspended working hours across educational institutions for a month.\nHarirchi, the ailing Iranian official, had the following advice for worried Iranians: “Take care of yourselves.

Online dating in the time of coronavirus", "text": "Before the French government imposed a lockdown to stem the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus, Etienne was a fierce critic of dating apps.\nThree weeks later, he's particularly proud of his Tinder bio.\n\"Buongiorno principessa [Hello Princess]! A charming prince locked in his great castle (or rather in a small apartment in the Parisian suburbs) is trying his luck on Tinder. The Macron [French President] dragon is hanging around and you can't get out until he's asleep (the government is talking about another four weeks)… So let's let our imagination and creativity fly.\"\nUnfortunately for the 30-year-old, he's had few matches. It's not easy to compete with the ingenuity and creativity of users today.\n\"It is not that I want to conquer you, but I have masks\", \"You, me, Netflix, cough and chill ... think about it\" or \"I am corona-negative\" are some of the descriptions now featured on Tinder.\nDating apps: a way to kill boredom?\nLike Étienne, many people have decided to give cyber love a chance to make quarantine less difficult.\nMaelle is one of them. Not being able to see people she knows doesn't bother her and it seems to her that with the situation, people are taking \"more time to get to know each other\" and \"conversations last longer.\"\nData in Spain confirms this. Since the beginning of the confinement, some of the applications have reported that conversations between users have become longer and that video calls, available in some of them, have increased.\nThe use of social networks like Tinder, Bumble and Meetic has also exploded among young people. A study of more than 8,000 people published by Smartme Analytics shows that since the Spanish government declared a state of emergency, the use of Tinder has increased by 94.4% among those under 35. Similar jumps have been observed on Badoo (+ 52.4%), Wapo (+ 34.9%) and Grindr (+ 24%).\nFor María Carolina Concha, a psychoanalytic doctor, the \"search for the other\" and the need to create a bond can be accentuated when isolated. \"It becomes more relevant, even if you can't have physical contact. Virtual conversation is also valid,\" she explained.\nWith the spread of the coronavirus and the implementation of confinement rules, the use of dating apps has also increased in other countries of the world. María Belén, a young woman who lives in Cochabamba, Bolivia, is taking advantage of the functionality that Tinder has made available to all its users — a \"passport\" that allows you to meet people from other parts of the world which was previously only accessible to premium accounts.\n\"Traveling to different places has made everything more interesting. I have gone to Spain, Italy, Budapest, Amsterdam ... It is fun and interesting to see how other people are dealing with the situation, the cultural exchange,\" she told Euronews.\nBut not everything is good. María Belén also believes that, with confinement, some men have become more insistent. \"They have their hormones super jumbled,\" she said.\n\"Why talk to someone you are not going to see?\"\nOthers just don't see the point of using dating apps during confinement.\n\"It is no use. I would get tired frankly. It is very important for me to see the other person,\" Audrey, a 25-year-old Parisian, stressed.\n\"I already have too many friends to talk to, to worry about Tinder,\" Victoria, also 25, told Euronews.\nThe young Londoner said that at the beginning of the quarantine, she even received proposals to go on walks, despite the fact that most of the applications have asked their users to stay home, postpone their appointments and opt for virtual meetings.\nOlivia (not her real name) lives in Paris and had been dating someone she met on the Bumble dating app for several weeks. The confinement came hastily, too soon to spend it together, but too late not to miss each other.\n\"Would I describe my situation as romantic? I think so,\" the 25-year-old said. \"Confinement has allowed us to let go of all dating app bias and made us realise that we felt a deeper attraction.\"\nDr. Concha offers an explanation: \"One of the things that this isolation has brought us is to re-value the bond with the other, at all levels. The meeting space is greatly re-valued.\"\nThus, despite not being able to physically meet, the two young people have opted for virtual dates almost every night and have found a way to relieve stress with a beer or guitar concerts. They've even managed to get intimate, though Olivia admitted she's not used to it yet.\nThe young woman is convinced that the dynamics of their relationship changed thanks to the quarantine. \"I don't know how it would have evolved without this,\" she confessed.\nHowever, some questions persist. How real is what you feel under extreme situations?\nOlivia and her new boyfriend may be living something very different from \"real life\" and she prefers to take things easy. \"I don't want us to decide to formalise the relationship because of this situation. Neither of us can meet someone else right now, but we are not obligated to be together because the situation is like this,\" she said.\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has brought uncertainty to many relationships, Dr. Concha maintains that the need to be in control, not only in COVID-19 times but in all kinds of situations, can ruin the bond that new couples are building.\nIt is for this reason that she recommends not putting pressure or worrying about how to maintain a new relationship: \"It is time to connect with the spontaneity of affection, without having many expectations for the future, to enjoy the things of the moment and see if it holds in the long term,\" she explained."}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/coronavirus_latest_626_confirmed_cases_in_finland_govt_preparing_to_restrict_movement_finnair_bars_passengers_with_symptoms_ski_centres_close_early/11249610", "title": "Coronavirus latest : Finland deaths increase to 11", "text": "An eatery at Espoo's Iso Omena shopping mall stands empty, but restaurants will be able to open their doors again on 1 June.

These include a cluster in Inner Mongolia, a northern province of windswept deserts, grasslands and unlovely industrial towns. Then came the covid-19 outbreak, and quarantine controls that locked down factories, ports and whole cities across China.\nChinese leaders insist that they are well on the way to conquering the virus, allowing them to reopen “leading enterprises and key links with important influence” in global supply chains. A victory over the novel coronavirus will once again demonstrate “the notable advantages of leadership by the Communist Party of China”, President Xi Jinping told 170,000 officials by video-conference on February 23rd. But even if all those boasts come true, foreign governments and business bosses will not quickly forget a frightening lesson: for some vital products, they depend on one country.\nWhere once only a few specialists worried about the market share enjoyed by the industrial chemists of Hohhot or Shijiazhuang, China’s dominance of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) sector is now the subject of hard questions in Washington’s corridors of power and the chancelleries of Europe. Ending the world’s dependence on Chinese APIs would not be a technical challenge. China has not been dominant for long. America’s last penicillin fermenter closed in 2004, as clusters of Chinese factories, many state-owned or subsidised, offered efficiencies that foreign rivals could not match. Rather, change would involve upending well-established political and economic theories, starting with the wisdom of allowing private companies to seek out the best-value goods, with little heed paid to their origin.\nThere is much speculation about whether covid-19 will accelerate trends in America and other Western countries to decouple from China. In truth, a rush to diversify in certain sectors is more likely, and even such a hedging of bets would build on trends that have been visible for some time.\nThe US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressional body, held hearings in July 2019 on threats and opportunities created by China’s medical industries. The tone quickly veered towards the doomy. A senior Pentagon official, Christopher Priest, declared that “the national-security risks of increased Chinese dominance of the global API market cannot be overstated.” He invited the hearing to imagine China interrupting supplies of irreplaceable drugs, such as those that protect troops against anthrax. Another witness, Benjamin Shobert, a health-care strategist at Microsoft, noted that mutual dependency was once seen as a reason to believe that Sino-American relations were stable and safe. But in an age of rising distrust, if those same calculated dependencies were to become a source of fear, then “much of what has supported the modern era of globalisation is no longer valid.”\nFor implacable China hawks like Peter Navarro, who advises President Donald Trump on trade, the covid-19 crisis is a told-you-so moment. On February 23rd Mr Navarro told Fox Business, a television channel, that America had outsourced “far too much” of its supply chain for essential medicines. “We have got to get it back onshore,” he said. Mr Navarro, an economic nationalist and vocal tariff advocate, is little loved by America’s trade partners. Yet his talk of nations needing to control certain forms of production finds an echo in rich-world capitals.\nJoerg Wuttke, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, says China’s dominance in sectors like pharmaceuticals and pesticides is a topic of concern when he visits officials in Berlin, Brussels and elsewhere. It does not help that China has shown itself willing to use trade to bully other countries during political disputes, as when it denied the export of rare earths to Japan in 2012. He does not expect firms to leave China altogether, because it drives global growth in so many sectors. But Mr Wuttke expects the epidemic to intensify European discussions about industrial policy. “The globalisation of putting everything where production is the most efficient, that is over.”\nJames McGregor, a China veteran who heads the Chinese operations of APCO, an American consultancy, watched businesses putting ever more eggs in the China basket for a decade. Hit by rising labour costs, trade tensions and now the virus, companies have concluded that they need to diversify—though many are struggling to find countries with China’s infrastructure and adaptable labour force. Against that, some firms that are in China to sell to China are expanding production there, in part to avoid the uncertainty of tariffs. The most capable high-tech companies see China as “the market of the future” for such promising industries as autonomous vehicles, robotics and the internet of things. They may be rewarded for their faith. “We are going to see the Chinese government be extraordinarily nice to companies once this virus is over,” suggests Mr McGregor.\nForeign trade without foreigners\nOne visible impact of the virus may be to speed changes at the top of firms. Multinationals have increasingly appointed Chinese executives (often Western-educated) to run their China operations. The epidemic may accelerate departures among the foreigners who remain. Air pollution has already driven many away. Some old-timers feel less welcome in a China taking a nationalist, authoritarian turn. Now they are living alone after evacuating their families, or in temporary exile abroad scrambling to find children school places in home countries they barely know. “A lot of my contemporaries don’t need much of a push” to leave, says a long-time China hand. Even if covid-19 burns out soon, it has clarified how the world is growing warier of China. Few firms can afford to leave completely. But an emotional decoupling is under way. ■\nRead more:\nCovid-19 is now in 50 countries, and things will get worse (February 27th)\nTo curb covid-19, China is using its high-tech surveillance tools (February 27th)\nAs its covid-19 epidemic slows, China tries to get back to work (February 27th)\nHow China’s coronavirus epidemic could hurt the world economy (February 13th)\nThis article appeared in the China section of the print edition under the headline \"Globalisation under quarantine\""}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-success-stories-2e24dba4-69a8-4791-8290-3367cdd063e0.html", "title": "Coronavirus success stories from around the world", "text": "Coronavirus success stories from around the world\nPatients are screened in Dakar, Senegal.

These expenses will not be covered, however, in the event that someone has traveled to an area regarding which the ministry has already issued a travel advisory, as in that case, the insured has traveled there at their own risk.\nSeesam Insurance travel insurance product manager Jonatan Jõks said that when purchasing a travel insurance policy from them, it is possible to purchase additional extended coverage or coverage for voluntary travel cancellation as well.\n\"Expenses incurred as a result of the cancellation of a conference are eligible for reimbursement if the insured has signed up for extended coverage,\" Jõks explained. \"This covers not only events cancelled as a result of the virus but also other cancelled events and risks such as natural disasters, strikes, terrorism, etc. Potential costs incurred as a result of ending up in quarantine are likewise only eligible for reimbursement under extended travel cancellation coverage.\"\nIf a traveler has only signed up for basic travel insurance, Seesam doesn't consider either of these situations to be an insured event. Purchasing a policy including voluntary travel cancellation coverage, however, will allow for a traveler to receive partial compensation for a trip canceled out of fear of the virus.\nAccording to Jõks, such a policy can be used for other reasons as well, and it will cover 70 percent of the policyholder's expenses otherwise not recoverable from hotels, airlines or other service providers. \"But this coverage can only be purchased within two weeks of purchasing one's trip, no later,\" he added.\n-\nDownload the ERR News app for Android and iOS now and never miss an update!\nEditor: Aili Vahtla"}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/b99c6532-5193-11ea-b4ee-385bb4c8d255", "title": "When to call in sick for work and how long you should stay at home", "text": "When to call in sick for work — and how long you should stay at home\nIt is still too early to predict the impact of the Covid-19 coronavirus on the UK, so public health officials are having to tread a fine line between preparing for the worst and keeping the country functioning as normal.

She pointed out that analysis of samples requires special labs. Sillanaukee added that by the end of the week there will be expanded testing capacity.\nAccording to the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare THL, as of Tuesday 720 samples had been tested for novel coronavirus. At present, testing is being carried out at four laboratories - THL's own facility, as well at university hospitals in Helsinki, Tampere and Turku.\nTurku's Turun Sanomat is among the papers reporting that Prime Minister Sanna Marin took part in a video conference call of EU leaders on the novel coronavirus situation Tuesday.\nAccording to a release by the Prime Minister's office, the discussion focused on the need for coordinated efforts and information sharing to battle the outbreak.\nNo new concrete measures were agreed upon.\nFollowing the call, Marin said pointed out that compared to many other EU countries, the number of cases in Finland is small, but officials are prepared for all contingencies and the required actions are being evaluated on a daily basis.\nNot the worst for Lapland\nAn editorial in Wednesday's Lapin Kansa, a daily published in Rovaniemi, notes that the impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on tourism in Finnish Lapland is not as bad, so far, as may be assumed.\nThe paper writes that there is a lot of uncertainty surrounds the virus and its effects. Uncertainty has become the new normal, something that feeds fears, whether those or justified or not.\nIt is the view of Lapin Kansa that at the end of the day, the fall in world oil prices may have a bigger impact on Finland than the corona virus.\nHowever, if the coronavirus outbreak does not fade soon, it will also affect Lapland. Lapland produces and exports goods such as pulp, paper and steel to global markets. Tourism is also a key and growing industry. A global recession will mean that fewer people travel. There will be less investment in tourism, lost jobs and bankruptcies.\nOn the other hand, Lapin Kansa points out that the situation could be worse. The novel coronavirus was not a significant concern until January, after the winter tourism season had peaked. The effect on end of the season is not yet clear, but it doesn't seem that tourism has collapsed. This shows, the paper says, that Lapland is still seen as a safe destination.\nUncertainty may be to some extent a positive thing for the tourism sector. There have been signs of the tourism becoming overheated in Lapland. It may be a good thing, says Lapin Kansa, if some of the investments already planned are abandoned, or at least delayed until better times.\nDon't wait to complain\nTampere's Aamulehti carries a report of the outcome of an appeal court ruling in Helsinki in which three Finnair passengers were not only denied compensation for a long flight delay, but now have been ordered to pay the airline nearly 8,000 euros in costs.\nThe three were booked on a Finnair flight to Chongqing China in January 2013 that was cancelled, and all rebooked on a flight 24 hours later. The passengers, as was their right, filed claims for 600 euros each in compensation for the delay.\nHowever, these passengers did not file those claims until in February of 2015, more than two years after the incident. After Finnair refused to honour, they challenged the airline in district court where they lost when judges decided there had been an unreasonably long period between the flight delay and the claims.\nThe appeal court agreed with the verdict and ordered the three to cover the costs of all the legal proceedings, a total of 7,840 euros.\nThe complainants can, though still make one more appeal to the Supreme Court.\nEx-champ hangs up her gloves\nEva Wahlström, the only Finnish boxer to ever hold a world title, has announced her retirement from the ring.\nWahlström, who held the female super-featherweight title from April 2015 to February of this year, confirmed to Helsingin Sanomat on Tuesday evening that she is hanging up her gloves, at least professionally.\nDuring her professional career, Wahlström had a record of 23 wins and only two losses and two draws.\nThe 39 year-old Loviisa native spent 20 years in the ring and was 10-time national amateur champion.\nDuring her career, Eva Wahlström was also a student, earning degrees in fine arts degree and physical education.

", "text": "'Things are changing so quickly': will Australia cope with coronavirus if the worst happens?\nDoctors have praised preparations so far, but want an Australian national body like the European Centre for Disease Control\n“What everyone is worried about is 1918 – Spanish flu. Fifty million deaths in a flu season. That was over 100,000 deaths a day.”\nProf Mark Walker, the director of the Australian Infectious Disease Research Centre at the University of Queensland, says Australia has had to respond to the novel coronavirus outbreak by imagining the worst that might happen.\n“That’s the perspective. Right at the start of an outbreak, you can’t predict which way it’s going to go, and that’s why there has been such a strong response.”\nBarely a month after the first recorded death from what is now known as Covid-19, about 1,500 people have died, almost all in the Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. Flight routes have been shut down, travel bans issued, thousands of people evacuated and quarantined. As the World Health Organization’s director general calls on countries to act quickly to prevent the spark of the disease “becoming a bigger fire”, leading epidemiologists say Australia’s response has been robust, but not perfect.\nIn Australia, the number of cases remains steady at 15, with five people having recovered and 10 stable. The Australian government has enacted a range of measures, advising residents to avoid travel to China, evacuating Australians from Wuhan to quarantine facilities on Christmas Island and outside Darwin, and banning arrivals from China of non-citizens and permanent residents – on Thursday Scott Morrison announced a week-long extension of the initial two-week ban. Wuhan itself is in lockdown.\nRecent figures coming out of China have caused confusion about the number of cases, but it will be months before the trajectory of the virus is properly understood, epidemiologists say. Current evidence suggests coronavirus has a mortality rate between 2% and 2.5%, compared with well below 1% for regular flu.\n“It’s really hard making decisions in the absence of much evidence,” says Prof Allen Cheng, the incoming president of the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases.\n“You don’t want to be saying ‘I don’t think it’s going to be anything’, and then it turns out to be worse than you think.”\nWhile researchers in Australia and globally have been mobilised to try to understand, treat and vaccinate against the virus, epidemiologists say it is the magnitude of uncertainty around the virus’s components and behaviour which has prompted extreme caution on the part of national public health agencies.\n“The problem is you don’t know, so it’s best to prepare for the worst,” Walker says.\nAustralia’s preparation ‘a bit clunky’\nMeasures to deal with “the worst” are canvassed as part of the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza, from vaccines and antiviral medication – which yet do not exist for Covid-19 – to border measures.\nShould current containment measures no longer be effective and the virus spreads more widely, the government will consider “social distancing”, which means cancelling large public events, encouraging people to work from home if possible, and closing down schools if it appears children are susceptible to the virus. Public health messaging about basic measures such as hand hygiene would also be amplified.\nThe plan also involves continuity preparation for businesses and hospital pandemic planning. Since the last serious outbreak, of swine flu in 2009, most hospitals have had pandemic plans in place which aim to allow them to function normally while dealing with an increased number of highly infectious patients. As in 2009, it is likely fever clinics would be established to isolate patients presenting with symptoms, and wards or spaces identified to hold those with the virus.\n“Most hospitals are fairly stretched at the best of times in the middle of winter,” Cheng says. But elective surgeries may be deferred in order to free up beds. “Intensive care is probably the pressure point,” he says.\nAustralia’s preparation is in line with best practice, Cheng says, but the situation in Hubei province would test any government. Australia last ran a national simulation exercise for pandemic flu, testing the system’s preparedness, in 2006.\nCheng says the current system is working, but “it’s just a bit clunky. It could work better.” Rather than drawing on a network of different committees and bodies, as the pandemic plan does, he says a permanent centre for disease control would be more efficient.\n“We don’t need one tomorrow. This is for the next one, and it’ll be something to review when we’re done with this virus,” he says.\nChristmas Island choice ‘draconian’\nThe Australian Medical Association has praised the national response so far, saying Australia has been prepared and acted in accordance with international best practice, although it criticised the choice of remote Christmas Island as a quarantine facility, noting specialist teams had to be flown to the island.\nProf Catherine Bennett, the chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, says the isolation on Christmas Island or the mining accommodation in Darwin “appears almost draconian … but that’s the extra step of caution that’s protecting a lot of people, including healthcare workers”. She says there are limited places where people can go for quarantine, and without those facilities it would be harder for people to return home at all.\nOutside China, she says, “we have the opportunity to try to get the gate closed, pick up any cases that come through by screening people and putting them into these 14-day holding periods to make sure they’re OK, because if it gets out into the community you’re chasing it, and it becomes a very difficult outbreak to manage”.\nBut Australia’s federal system has meant the response has not been entirely uniform.\nBennett says there have been inconsistencies between states in public messaging, specifically around who needs to self-isolate. “The more consistent the message is, the less confusing it is for people and the more likely they are to abide by it,” she says.\nThe outbreak has prompted the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases to renew its call for the establishment of a central government body to monitor and coordinate responses to public health threats such as novel virus outbreaks.\n“The main issue is that things are changing so quickly that some states may get ahead of others in terms of response,” Cheng says. “That’s always going to be a problem in a situation like this, because our knowledge keeps changing.\n“I think in general the coordination has been reasonably good this time, but I think with the speed of changes and those sorts of things, there is a little bit of slippage.”\nCheng and Asid say a national body like the European Centre for Disease Control, which coordinates a Europe-wide response to emerging threats, could improve Australia’s national response.\nAustralia has a model for coordinating response to outbreaks – in food. OzFoodNet draws together food epidemiologists to monitor and respond to new threats to food security.\nWalker says the coordination and speed of the Australian response to disease outbreaks has vastly improved, but a centralised body for disease control could be “useful” if it were backed by the states and well funded by the federal government.\n“You wouldn’t be able to do that sort of thing on the cheap,” he says. “I think it’s a good wake-up call nationally. Our preparedness for future infectious diseases is really important.”\nPublic fear and response\nEpidemiologists say that while caution is critical, so too is perspective.\nLast year, more than 250 people in Australia died from regular flu. Globally, influenza kills 1,000 people a day.\n“For perspective, there’s a long way to go before corona virus is as much to worry about as the flu,” Walker says.\nWalker and Bennett both say media coverage has tended towards scare, and information has been incomplete. Most reported deaths from coronavirus have been among high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with other conditions. For the average person in Australia who hasn’t been travelling, Bennett says, the chance of contracting Covid-19 is almost zero.\nBut public anxiety remains high, and Chinese Australians have borne the brunt of it, with reports of racist behaviour towards those of Chinese appearance.\nThe mood prompted Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, to reiterate that the risk is among people who have recently visited China, not the Australian Chinese community. “We are very concerned about xenophobia and any sort of racial profiling, which is completely abhorrent,” he said. “We’re talking about a relatively small number of people just because of where they’ve been, not who they are. There is no community transmission of this virus in Australia.”\nCheng, who is of Chinese ancestry, says he can understand the anxiety, but it needs to be combated.\n“There are only 15 cases in Australia as best we know,” he says. The last census recorded 1.2m Australian residents with Chinese ancestry. “Clearly, most people don’t have it.”\nWalker points out that infectious diseases can spring from anywhere. Australia is the origin, for instance, of Ross River virus. “We don’t want to get into a geographic blame game about where a particular disease originates. We want to mount the best and most appropriate response to prevent disease progression and spread,” he says.\nChina is not the enemy, but the most important ally in containing this threat, Cheng says. “If they get it under control we all need to absolutely thank China for cutting this off at the source, and they really need as much support from us as we can.”\n• This article was amended on 17 February 2020 to correct the mortality rate for regular flu.

The family said the company didn't do enough to protect him.\nDriving the news: Meat processing workers, many of them low-income immigrants and minorities, are being recalled to plants where thousands have been sickened. If the administration has its way, their employers will enjoy liability protection, shielding them from lawsuits brought by workers or their family members who contracted COVID-19.\nBut the issue is fraught. On one side are groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which sent a letter to Trump on Tuesday pushing him to curb the amount of liability businesses could face.\n- The letter warned against a scenario where \"government bureaucrats enforcing a rule book of regulations\" could \"issue fines when they find a sneeze guard out of place.\"\n- The letter was delivered to a receptive audience: Trump and his chief economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, are said to be in favor of a \"liability shield\" that would \"prevent businesses from being sued by customers who contract the coronavirus,\" per the Washington Post.\nOn the other side are consumer advocates and unions, some of which sent a letter to Congress saying, \"legal liability is one of the most powerful incentives we have to ensure that businesses operate safely.\"\n- Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii tweeted: \"Forcing meat processing plants to stay open without adequate worker protections while shielding owners from liability just for @realDonaldTrump's personal, political benefit demonstrates a callous disregard for human life.\"\nDetails: Lawyers say the meat producers being forced to reopen plants — like Tyson Foods, Conagra, Smithfield Foods, JBS and Cargill — could face a range of legal challenges if their workers get sick or if they're unable to honor contracts with suppliers and customers.\n- \"What if I get sick at work, and I can show that my employer didn't take enough steps to prevent that colleague next to me from from coming in?\" Omer Tene of the International Association of Privacy Professionals tells Axios.\n- A \"force majeure\" clause in a contract that frees both parties from liability in the event of extraordinary circumstances could suddenly be nullified, leaving the meat company with contracts to fill and cattle it's obliged to buy, David Domina, a trial practice lawyer in Omaha, tells Axios.\n- And a big percentage of workers could call in sick, leaving the plant unable to function at full capacity.\n- \"The overwhelming majority of the workforce could have worker's comp claims,\" Domina says.\nEven before the president's order on Tuesday, workers at a Smithfield Foods pork processing plant in Milan, Mo. — which has not closed — sued the company, seeking an injunction until more safety measures are put in place.\n- An anonymous plaintiff who works at the plant wrote an impassioned article in the Washington Post saying, \"managers never blatantly asked me to risk my life just by showing up — until this pandemic.\"\nThe bottom line: No business will be immune from the possibility of liability lawsuits as the nation opens up again."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/13/corona-zombies-film-full-moon-features", "title": "Corona Zombies : the terrible movie we might just need right now", "text": "Corona Zombies: the terrible movie we might just need right now\nA rushed, spliced-together comedy horror about the pandemic is as bad as it sounds, but its silliness could make it a fitting antidote\nLast month I told you about the trailer for Corona, a film that had been conceived, written and shot since the first flushes of Covid-19. At the time it seemed like an incredible feat, like it would definitively become the first coronavirus movie that any of us saw. However, I am afraid to tell you that it has been beaten to the punch. Because, in that time, another coronavirus movie was written and shot. Furthermore, it was released on Friday. World, meet Corona Zombies.\nIn truth, Corona Zombies barely qualifies as a film. It’s only an hour long, and you can only watch it by subscribing to the Full Moon Features streaming service (other available films include Evilbong 666 and Swedish Boarding School Girls). But, screw it, it still counts. And now that you’ve got plenty of time on your hands, you should probably watch it.\nTurned around in 28 days with every member of the cast and crew under self-isolation, Corona Zombies is actually the result of a deft sleight of hand. It only has one actor – Cody Renee Cameron, last seen playing a prostitute in Vince Gilligan’s El Camino – with the rest stitched together from Donald Trump soundbites, that viral clip of the spring break idiots. Primarily, though, the film is made up of redubbed footage from two old zombie B-movies, Hell of the Living Dead and Zombies vs Strippers. Corona Zombies is, in effect, the What’s Up, Tiger Lily? of the lockdown age.\nIt has a shaky start. Cameron, playing an airhead named Barbie, trots out all the familiar jokes that you’re already sick of – “Coronavirus? Why is everyone drinking beer?” “Wuhan? But I like that rap group” – before things get up and running. And in that sense, Corona Zombies is the model of efficient exposition. Barbie watches the news. The anchor describes the symptoms of the virus, and then immediately cuts away to breaking news about how the virus has definitely turned waves of people into zombies. And then we’re off to the races.\nWe visit ground zero of the virus; a Chinese bat soup factory which is already under full attack from the zombies. A zombie taskforce is put together to murder the zombies. They stop off along the way to catch a toilet roll hoarder. There are many, many cracks about maintaining a six-foot distance. “This is for not washing your hands!” a character screams as he offloads the contents of a machine gun into a swarm of zombies. During one of the most exploitative scenes, where a young woman’s naked breasts are splattered with blood from a nearby zombie disembowelment, a news reporter gravely implies that none of this would have happened if everyone had observed social distancing. It’s a bit like watching a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 episode, which is no bad thing.\nIf this was any other time, I’d advise skipping Corona Zombies. It’s fun for 20 minutes, but then burns out as the central gimmick wears on. Only a certain amount of coronavirus jokes exist at this point, and Corona Zombies tells them all repeatedly. It’s the sort of thing you’d watch drunk in your house at midnight. But then again, that’s how you’re going to watch all films for the foreseeable future, so it has to be worth a go.\nIn the future, everyone will make a coronavirus movie. And, for the most part these will be sad and serious and boring, and will largely exist so that Mark Ruffalo – who will play a senator whistleblowing governmental negligence in every single one of them – can emote sufficiently for awards season to notice. Meanwhile, now that we’re in the thick of it, the heavy genre of Corona Zombies seems like the only acceptable place to meet this thing. It’s a perfect reaction piece. Schlocky, tongue-in-cheek, over the top. It exists to undermine the thing that we’re all scared of.

The masked evacuees, exhausted by the long journey, were peeking through bus windows as they drove slowly under a heavy police escort.\nStones shattered a window in one of the buses, but the evacuees appeared unhurt.\nSince the early morning, several hundred residents of the village of Novi Sanzhary in Ukraine’s central Poltava region had cut the road to a sanitarium intended to host the evacuees, fearing they could become infected. Demonstrators, some of whom appeared drunk, put up road blocks, burned tires and clashed with riot police who moved to clear access. One protester tried to ram police lines with his car.\nNine police officers and one civilian were hospitalized, the regional police said in a statement.\nUkrainian police said 24 protesters were detained. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, who personally visited the site to try to calm the crowd, said he was shocked by the aggression.\n“What we saw was shameful,” he said in televised remarks. “It was one of the biggest disappointments in my life.”\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy weighed in, saying the protests showed “not the best side of our character.” He tried to reassure people that the quarantined evacuees wouldn’t pose any danger to local residents.\nIn a statement published on his Facebook page, Zelenskiy said the people evacuated from China are healthy and will live in a closed medical center run by the National Guard in the village as a precaution.\n“In the next two weeks it will probably be the most guarded facility in the country,” Zelenskiy said.\nUkraine’s health minister, Zoryana Skaletska, said she would join the evacuees in quarantine for two weeks to help assuage villagers’ concerns. She urged residents to show sympathy and support for the evacuees and emphasized that the quarantine facility is in full conformity with international standards.\n“I was shocked by the panic, rejection, negative feelings and aggression,” she said. “It was even a greater shock for the people who were evacuated from China.”\nBut municipal legislators in the village vowed to continue opposing the evacuation, saying that the sanitarium’s sewage system is linked to the one in the village and ends up in a nearby wastewater facility.\n“We can’t allow putting the health and life of local residents at risk, and demand that top officials take urgent moves to prevent people from China from being put here,” they said in a statement.\nAmid the clashes between local residents and police, Ukraine’s Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk said he will immediately fly to the site to personally oversee things.\nIn the early hours of Thursday, a plane with 45 Ukrainians and 27 foreign nationals took off from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak that has infected more than 75,000 people worldwid e and killed over 2,100.\nThose evacuated included people from Belarus, Kazakhstan, Argentina, Ecuador, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Panama and other countries.\nArgentina’s Foreign Ministry in a statement thanked Ukraine for its “generosity” and China for its collaboration.\nThe plane stopped in Kazakhstan to drop off Kazakh passengers. Later, it sought to land in Kharkiv, a city in northeastern Ukraine, but could not due to bad weather conditions.\nInstead it flew to Kyiv to refuel, and eventually arrived in Kharkiv.\nAlso Thursday, the Russian Embassy in Japan said that two more Russians aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan have been diagnosed with the virus. That raises to three the number of Russians on the ship confirmed to have the virus.\nThe two will be transferred to a hospital in Japan for treatment, according to the embassy.\nIn Slovenia, authorities said two of six Slovenian citizens who were on the cruise ship have been hospitalized in Japan after testing positive for the virus. The four others have tested negative. Two of them have arrived back in Slovenia and will be quarantined at home for two weeks.\nThe Diamond Princess has been docked in the Yokohama port near Tokyo since Feb. 4, when 10 people on board tested positive for the virus. So far 621 cases of the disease, which has been named COVID-19, have been confirmed among the the Diamond Princess’s original 3,711 people on board.\nRussia so far has reported only two cases of the disease on its soil. Two Chinese nationals diagnosed with the virus and hospitalized in two different regions of Siberia in late January have recovered and have been released from hospitals.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Dmytro Vlasov reported this sotyr in Novi Sanzhary and AP writer Yuras Karmanau reported from Minsk, Belarus.

But it is also increasingly taking measures aimed at keeping the virus at bay.\nThis week Russia closed its borders to people arriving from Italy, and Moscow’s City Hall said it would be allocating nearly $135 million for a new hospital for coronavirus patients. It also banned visits to state-run nursing homes, which house the most vulnerable people to the virus, according to a copy of a decree viewed by The Moscow Times.\nSome big companies, including Yandex, have also suggested that their employees work from home. The tech giant is also reportedly regularly disinfecting its fleet of ride-sharing cars.\nThe Russian capital has also been placed on “high alert” — limiting gatherings to no more than 5,000 people, warning residents not to travel on public transport during rush hour and requiring returnees from coronavirus hotspots to self-isolate for 14 days. Anyone ignoring quarantine requirements could face up to five years in prison.\nTo enforce those rules, authorities have warned that they will be using CCTV cameras. Last week, one Muscovite who was placed on quarantine after returning from northern Italy in February told the Mediazona news website that police showed up at his apartment the day after he violated his quarantine by taking out the trash. That same month, Moscow’s mayor Sergei Sobyanin bragged that the city’s widespread facial-recognition network had helped in tracking down a Chinese woman who flew to the Russian capital from Beijing.\nChinese people have come under particular scrutiny. On Thursday, the Kommersant business daily reported that some 100 Chinese students would be sent home for violating quarantine procedures.\nBut worries have been raised about the authorities abusing their powers in these cases. In one case, police showed up at a Chinese student’s dorm room in Moscow, offered to take her for a medical test, then wrote her up for violating quarantine, Mediazona reported. Now she is awaiting deportation.\nWhile Moscow is home to over half of Russia’s coronavirus cases, it is the city of Lipetsk some 460 kilometers to the south that has taken the most aggressive measures.\nThe city has so far reported three people with the coronavirus who recently returned from Italy and has put 150 people who may have come into contact with them under quarantine. It has also shut all schools and public gathering spaces like theaters and sporting arenas. The local Orthodox Church was planning a procession against the coronavirus, but that, too, has been canceled over coronavirus worries.\nFor some residents, the measures don’t go far enough.\n“They should not have put 150 people under home quarantine, but should have sent them to the hospital for two weeks!” the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper cited one resident as writing on social media. “Everyone should be assigned a policeman to prevent possible escape.”\nIn a column this week, Maxim Trudolyubov, a Senior Fellow at the Kennan Institute in Washington D.C., speculated that, as China has started to bring the contagion under control while the virus spreads rapidly in European countries and the United States, some people may begin to see the good in authoritarian measures.\nBut others have raised concerns that Russia’s reported cases may be low not as a result of effective preventative measures but because of a lack of effective testing procedures.\nLast week, the Reuters news agency spoke to doctors in Moscow and St. Petersburg who claimed that the country still did not have systematic testing capabilities in place.\nStill others are writing about their problems in getting tested on social media.\nMaya Volf, 23, wrote on Twitter that, after getting a bad cough following a visit to Germany in February, she put herself on the mandated 14-day quarantine. But the cough got worse and she called for a doctor, who arrived Thursday without any protective gear save for a thin mask. The doctor told her she didn’t have the coronavirus because she hadn’t been in Germany within 14 days.\nLater that evening, two medics did arrive in full protective gear and took a throat swab. Volf will have her results back in seven to 10 days, she wrote.\nOn Friday, Eva Hartog, a Dutch Moscow-based journalist and former managing editor of The Moscow Times, wrote on Twitter that a friend had self-isolated after coming down with a cough and fever — two symptoms of the coronavirus — after having passed through an international airport. As her condition deteriorated, she called for an ambulance.\n“When [the medics] heard this person hadn't recently arrived from one of the blacklisted countries they announced: Then it's not corona,” Hartog wrote.\nRussia also appears to be dragging its feet in other areas. While sporting events are being canceled across the world, the Russian professional football league is continuing with play and is not banning traditional pre-match handshakes.\nAnd as Europe’s football governing body debates whether to go ahead with the European Championships this summer, Russia’s Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko has offered Russia as a possible location to host more games.\nMeanwhile, some Russians are placing their faith in God.\nAll week in St. Petersburg, Easter month worshippers who have been flocking to the Kazan Cathedral have been flouting guidelines by kissing icons, the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper reported.\n“We have faith, understand?” one worshiper told the paper. “Will God really let us get infected here? I think not.”\nAs for the authorities, they aren't taking any chances when it comes to themselves.\nAfter one lawmaker attended a speech given by President Vladimir Putin this week at the State Duma after returning from coronavirus hotspot France without self-quarantining, another deputy ratted him out.\nThe parliament building is now being disinfected."}, {"url": "https://news.err.ee/1065714/family-members-can-not-attend-children-s-births-during-emergency-situation", "title": "Family members can not attend children births during emergency situation", "text": "Family members can not attend children's births during emergency situation ({{contentCtrl.commentsTotal}})\nBirthing partners or family members will not be allowed to attend the births of children during the emergency situation, it was decided by doctors and midwives on Wednesday, to limit the risk of spreading coronavirus (COVID-19).\nOn Tuesday, the Estonian Society of Midwives (Eesti ämmaemandate ühing), the Estonian Society of Pediatricians (Eesti lastearstide selts), and the Estonian Society of Perinatology (Eesti perinatoloogia selts) agreed on recommendations for monitoring pregnancy, obstetrics and monitoring newborns at risk during their first weeks of life during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIt was decided that birthing partners and other family members would not be allowed at births. \"The more people there are in health care facilities, the more difficult it is to ensure their movements are controlled and prevent the spread of infection,\" a statement said.\nAgreed changes:\n- Delivery assistance for a woman with a confirmed case of COVID-19 will be provided as usual. Caesarean section and other interventions will be carried out from indications of the health of the woman in labor or the fetus based on the current situation.\n- If the mother is suspected to have COVID-19, it is recommended the baby be isolated from the mother until the maternal test results are confirmed.\n- Breastfeeding is not recommended during the isolation period. If a mother with suspected COVID-19 tests negative, she may start breastfeeding. The mother has the right to decline this recommendation.\n- If the mother has a confirmed case of COVID-19, it is recommended the mother and child be kept isolated for two weeks to reduce the risk of neonatal infection. The mother will be advised to pump breast milk and maintain breast milk production so that she can switch to breastfeeding in the future. This recommendation may also be rejected by the mother, but it should be borne in mind that there is a very high risk of droplet and contact infection during breastfeeding.\n- To reduce the risk of infection, the number of visits to the hospital during pregnancy will be temporarily reduced.\nEmergency care is available 24/7 in all clinics. These are temporary measures which are applicable only in emergency situations.\nThe decisions made are based on relatively limited information available and may change as new information becomes available and the situation changes.\nThe purpose of the recommendations is to protect mothers, children and obstetricians from infection in the face of the epidemic and to preserve the health of mothers and newborns, said the head of the West Tallinn Central Hospital Women's Clinic.\n--\nDownload the ERR News app for Android and iOS now and never miss an update!\nEditor: Helen Wright"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/coronavirus-two-australians-evacuated-from-diamond-princess-test-positive-in-darwin", "title": "Coronavirus : two Australians evacuated from Diamond Princess test positive in Darwin", "text": "Coronavirus: two Australians evacuated from Diamond Princess test positive in Darwin\nAll cruise ship passengers tested negative before flight home, but two found to have Covid-19 upon arrival\nTwo Australians evacuated from the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan have tested positive to the disease in Darwin.\nThe two, one young person and one elderly, remain well and are being housed in a separate isolation unit inside the Manigurr-ma village outside Darwin, Australia’s chief medical officer said Friday morning.\nPublic health authorities from their home states were organising medical transfers for the patients and their partners.\nAustralia’s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said all of the 164 Australian citizens and permanent residents evacuated from the Diamond Princess on Thursday, and flown to Darwin, were health screened before boarding the Qantas flight out of Japan. None of those allowed to board returned positive tests or displayed any symptoms of the disease.\nThe passengers were screened again when they landed in Darwin and six showed minor respiratory symptoms and fevers. They were isolated from others in the group. Four of those patients have returned negative tests.\n“Given there was continued evidence of spread of infection on board the Diamond Princess in recent days, the development of some positive cases after return to Australia is not unexpected, despite all of the health screening before departure.” Murphy said.\n“Fellow passengers and crew on the Qantas flight which returned people trapped on the Diamond Princess can be assured all measures were taken to ensure their protection.”\nMurphy said there was no public health risk from the new infections. “This development poses no risk to the broader community.”\nTen Australians who sought to board the evacuation flight from Japan were told they could not leave because they had tested positive to Covid-19. They are being treated in Japan. It’s not known when they will be able to return to Australia.\nThe acting NT chief health officer, Dianne Stephens, said the medical teams working inside the Manigurr-ma village, a former worker’s village in Howard Springs on Darwin’s outskirts, were maintaining strict quarantine protocols.\n“Every day we will screen, we will isolate people who have symptoms and we will test them and we will follow this process. The Ausmat team know how to ... manage quarantine and infection control. So the community remains safe from the Covid-19 infection as do all the staff within the facility as do all the staff that were on the plane that brought those people home.”\nThe 290-metre Diamond Princes cruise liner has become the largest outbreak of coronavirus outside of mainland China, with 634 cases, far ahead of the next largest centres, South Korea (104), and Japan (94).\nTwo people who contracted the illness on board the ship, an 87-year-old man and an 84-year-old woman, have died.\nThe quarantine procedures on board have been criticised, in particular the failure to isolate known cases from uninfected people.\nIn a YouTube video since pulled offline, Kentaro Iwata, professor at the infectious diseases division of Japan’s Kobe University, described the situation on board as “chaotic” and “completely inadequate in terms of infection control”.\nGlobally, Covid-19 has infected 76,000 people and killed 2,267.\nThere have been 17 cases of coronavirus in Australia: five in Queensland; four in New South Wales; four in Victoria; two in South Australia, and now, two in the Northern Territory. Ten of the earlier cases have fully recovered.\nOn Thursday, the government extended a ban on travellers from China entering Australia. Foreign nationals – excluding permanent residents – who have been in mainland China will not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they left mainland China.\nAustralian citizens and permanent residents will still be able to enter, as will their immediate family members, defined as spouses, legal guardians and dependants only.\nPeople who have been in contact with someone confirmed to have coronavirus must self-isolate for 14 days from the time they were in contact with that person."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/opinion/coronavirus-china-numbers.html", "title": "Opinion | Were Reading the Coronavirus Numbers Wrong", "text": "Numbers have a certain mystique: They seem precise, exact, sometimes even beyond doubt. But outside the field of pure mathematics, this reputation rarely is deserved. And when it comes to the coronavirus epidemic, buying into that can be downright dangerous.\nNaturally, everyone wants to know how deadly COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, is. The technical term for that is the case fatality rate — which is, put simply, the number of people who have died from the disease (D) divided by the total number of people who were infected with it (I), or D/I. As of Tuesday morning, at least 1,873 people were thought to have died from the disease worldwide and 72,869 people to have been infected.\nBut those figures may not mean what you think.\nThe number of deaths (D) seems like it should be easy enough to determine: After all, dead is dead. And yet ascribing a cause of death can be tricky.\nThe coronavirus might be blamed for the deaths of vulnerable people, especially seniors, already suffering from other illnesses, such as diabetes and other chronic conditions. On the other hand, some deaths will be attributed to other illnesses that might more accurately be ascribed to COVID-19.\nEven more problematic is figuring out the total number of infected people (I) — call that the mystery of the denominator. Patients who have tested positive and are hospitalized are included in that tally, of course. But what about those who are being treated without formally having been tested? Or those who might be infected and yet display no symptoms?\nAnother complicating factor is the remaining number of unresolved or indeterminate cases: Medical experts still aren’t sure, for example, how long the infection’s incubation period may be.\nAnd then, in addition to the uncertainty inherent in the basic numbers, there are the distortions unintentionally created by the way those numbers are reported by medical officials and presented by the media.\nLast week, the authorities of Hubei, the province in China at the center of the epidemic, revised their definition of what it means to be infected by the new coronavirus: On Thursday, they started including people who displayed symptoms associated with COVID-19 — coughing, a fever, difficulty breathing — even if those people hadn’t been tested or had tested negative for the virus. As a result, the number of new daily cases increased by a factor of nine overnight.\nBut what did that spike reveal, in fact?\nIf the daily tally of newly infected people increases, does that mean the disease actually is spreading at that moment? That it is more contagious than we had known?\nAnd if the number of deaths — or the ratio of deaths to infections — jumps from one day to the next, does that mean the disease has just gotten more lethal? Or that it actually is more lethal than we thought it was the day before?\nNot necessarily, though it may seem or feel that way. The shifts might be short-term adjustments or simply the effects, or artifacts, of delayed disclosures — a kind of numerical optical illusion.\nYet when news outlets reported last week, after the revision in what counts as an infection, the largest jump in reported cases “in a single day and more than twice the previous record high,” readers could be forgiven for assuming that the situation had just taken a turn for the worse. Even articles that stated the broader circumstances of the increase could be misleading: Some, by announcing in their headlines a “dramatic spike” or a “surge” in the number of cases; others, by discussing the swell while stating that local officials had been sacked for it.\nThe fact that China suddenly broadened its criteria also raised fears that its earlier numbers might have been incorrect: too low, and perhaps deliberately so. National pride and the fear of economic costs or a popular backlash might have motivated underreporting, the suspicion went.\nBut the reasons for the shift could also be more mundane. Maybe the medical authorities in China didn’t report more infections previously because they couldn’t — because, say, they were short of reliable test kits (which they were). It’s possible that the numbers were fudged. But maybe they weren’t, or not as much as some people seem to fear. The change in criteria for what counts as an infection may indicate, not so much nefarious evidence of a cover-up now exposed, but the struggles of a local health care system overwhelmed by a sudden and colossal medical crisis.\nLast Thursday, the Hubei authorities also reported a leap in the new daily tally of deaths: 242, compared with 94 for Wednesday. That’s a big jump, but not nearly as big as the increase in the number of newly infected people over the same period. Which could be a cause for some measure of relief: The disease’s lethality would seem to have decreased or be lower than was previously thought. Yet that’s not the takeaway likely to have prevailed.\nSome of the reporting has amounted to a set of contradictory pronouncements, confusing at best. Journalists could display more critical distance and a modicum of skepticism toward the data they relay, instead of turning the media coverage into a hall of mirrors.\nOne major problem is the doing of no one in particular. The story about the coronavirus’s spread is evolving quickly, with medical authorities in China and elsewhere disclosing figures daily (or more often), and the media reporting the information immediately to satisfy the fast-paced, staccato rhythms of publishing cycles. But up-to-the-minute, blow-by-blow accounts of hard data can create mistaken impressions about the underlying facts, even if both the data and the accounts are accurate.\nLast Thursday, a surge in the number of infections was reported, because of that change in official criteria. On Monday, China announced a drop in the number of new cases for the third consecutive day. Now what should we make of that?\nConstant on-the-nose reporting, however much it seems to serve transparency, has limitations, too.\nIt’s a short-term, and shortsighted, approach that’s difficult to resist, especially when people are afraid and the authorities are taking draconian actions. It’s only natural to compare and contrast whatever hard facts are available. And yet it’s especially dangerous to do that precisely because people are so anxious, and fear can trick the mind.\nA view from a loftier perch — a month’s, or even just a week’s, perspective — would, and will, produce far more reliable information.\nAs of Tuesday, the case fatality rate of COVID-19 appeared to be about 2.5 percent. That’s in keeping with what it was, for example, from the beginning of the outbreak up to Jan. 28. By comparison, the case fatality rate for the seasonal flu in the United States ranges between 0.10 percent and 0.18 percent. For SARS, it’s about 10 percent and for MERS, about 35 percent. For Ebola, it has varied between 25 percent and 90 percent, depending on outbreaks, averaging approximately 50 percent.\nAnd so based on what we know so far, COVID-19 seems to be much less fatal than other coronavirus infections and diseases that turned into major epidemics in recent decades. The operative words here are “based on what we know so far” — meaning, both no more and no less than that, and also that our take on the situation might need to change as more data come in.\nRemember, too, that even if only a small percentage of the people infected with COVID-19 die in the end, the death toll in absolute numbers could still be dreadful if the total population of infected turns out to be very large.\nHowever much we would like to know all the relevant facts about the coronavirus, we don’t know them right now, and we should accept the discomfort of that uncertainty. Which is all the more reason to abide by one of the things we do know at this point: You should wash your hands regularly.\nJohn Allen Paulos is a professor of mathematics at Temple University and the author of “A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper” and, most recently, “A Numerate Life.”\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Amid a meandering answer, Trump remarked, “You can call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus. You know, you can call it many different names. I’m not sure anybody even knows what it is.”\nThat was neither the most consequential statement from the White House, nor the most egregious. But it was perhaps the most ironic. In a pandemic characterized by extreme uncertainty, one of the few things experts know for sure is the identity of the pathogen responsible: a virus called SARS-CoV-2 that is closely related to the original SARS virus. Both are members of the coronavirus family, which is entirely distinct from the family that includes influenza viruses. Scientists know the shape of proteins on the new coronavirus’s surface down to the position of individual atoms. Give me two hours, and I can do a dramatic reading of its entire genome.\nBut much else about the pandemic is still maddeningly unclear. Why do some people get really sick, but others do not? Are the models too optimistic or too pessimistic? Exactly how transmissible and deadly is the virus? How many people have actually been infected? How long must social restrictions go on for? Why are so many questions still unanswered?\nThe confusion partly arises from the pandemic’s scale and pace. Worldwide, at least 3.1 million people have been infected in less than four months. Economies have nose-dived. Societies have paused. In most people’s living memory, no crisis has caused so much upheaval so broadly and so quickly. “We’ve never faced a pandemic like this before, so we don’t know what is likely to happen or what would have happened,” says Zoë McLaren, a health-policy professor at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County. “That makes it even more difficult in terms of the uncertainty.”\nBut beyond its vast scope and sui generis nature, there are other reasons the pandemic continues to be so befuddling—a slew of forces scientific and societal, epidemiological and epistemological. What follows is an analysis of those forces, and a guide to making sense of a problem that is now too big for any one person to fully comprehend.\nI. The Virus\nBecause coronavirus wasn’t part of the popular lexicon until SARS-CoV-2 ran amok this year, earlier instances of the term are readily misconstrued. When people learned about a meeting in which global leaders role-played through a fictional coronavirus pandemic, some wrongly argued that the actual pandemic had been planned. When people noticed mentions of “human coronavirus” on old cleaning products, some wrongly assumed that manufacturers had somehow received advance warning.\nRead: Why the coronavirus has been so successful\nThere isn’t just one coronavirus. Besides SARS-CoV-2, six others are known to infect humans—four are mild and common, causing a third of colds, while two are rare but severe, causing MERS and the original SARS. But scientists have also identified about 500 other coronaviruses among China’s many bat species. “There will be many more—I think it’s safe to say tens of thousands,” says Peter Daszak of the EcoHealth Alliance, who has led that work. Laboratory experiments show that some of these new viruses could potentially infect humans. SARS-CoV-2 likely came from a bat, too.\nIt seems unlikely that a random bat virus should somehow jump into a susceptible human. But when you consider millions of people, in regular contact with millions of bats, which carry tens of thousands of new viruses, vanishingly improbable events become probable ones. In 2015, Daszak’s team found that 3 percent of people from four Chinese villages that are close to bat caves had antibodies that indicated a previous encounter with SARS-like coronaviruses. “Bats fly out every night over their houses. Some of them shelter from rain in caves, or collect guano for fertilizer,” Daszak says. “If you extrapolate up to the rural population, across the region where the bats that carry these viruses live, you’re talking 1 [million] to 7 million people a year exposed.” Most of these infections likely go nowhere. It takes just one to trigger an epidemic.\nOnce that happens, uncertainties abound as scientists race to characterize the new pathogen. That task is always hard, but especially so when the pathogen is a coronavirus. “They’re very hard to work with; they don’t grow very well in cell cultures; and it’s been hard to get funding,” says Vineet Menachery of the University of Texas Medical Branch. He is one of just a few dozen virologists in the world who specialize in coronaviruses, which have attracted comparatively little attention compared with more prominent threats like flu. The field swelled slightly after the SARS epidemic of 2003, but then shrunk as interest and funding dwindled. “It wasn’t ’til MERS came along [in 2012] that I even thought I could have an academic career on coronaviruses,” Menachery says.\nThe tight group of coronavirologists is now racing to make up for years of absent research—a tall order in the middle of a pandemic. “We’re working as hard as possible,” says Lisa Gralinski, a virologist at the University of North Carolina. “Our space is so intermingled that we can’t socially distance among ourselves much.”\nOne small mercy, she notes, is that SARS-CoV-2 isn’t changing dramatically. Scientists are tracking its evolution in real time, and despite some hype about the existence of different strains, the virologists I’ve spoken with largely feel that the virus is changing at a steady and predictable pace. There are no signs of “an alarming mutation we need to be worried about,” Gralinski says. For now, the world is facing just one threat. But that threat can manifest in many ways.\nII. The Disease\nSARS-CoV-2 is the virus. COVID-19 is the disease that it causes. The two aren’t the same. The disease arises from a combination of the virus and the person it infects, and the society that person belongs to. Some people who become infected never show any symptoms; others become so ill that they need ventilators. Early Chinese data suggested that severe and fatal illness occurs mostly in the elderly, but in the U.S. (and especially in the South), many middle-aged adults have been hospitalized, perhaps because they are more likely to have other chronic illnesses. The virus might vary little around the world, but the disease varies a lot.\nRead: The coronavirus’s unique threat to the South\nThis explains why some of the most important stats about the coronavirus have been hard to pin down. Estimates of its case-fatality rate (CFR)—the proportion of diagnosed people who die—have ranged from 0.1 to 15 percent. It’s frustrating to not have a firm number, but also unrealistic to expect one. “Folks are talking about CFR as this unchangeable quantity, and that is not how it works,” says Maia Majumder, an epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital.\nThe CFR’s denominator—total cases—depends on how thoroughly a country tests its population. Its numerator—total deaths—depends on the spread of ages within that population, the prevalence of preexisting illnesses, how far people live from hospitals, and how well staffed or well equipped those hospitals are. These factors vary among countries, states, and cities, and the CFR will, too. (Majumder and her colleagues are now building tools for predicting regional CFRs, so local leaders can determine which regions are most vulnerable.)\nThe variability of COVID-19 is also perplexing doctors. The disease seems to wreak havoc not only on lungs and airways, but also on hearts, blood vessels, kidneys, guts, and nervous systems. It’s not clear if the virus is directly attacking these organs, if the damage stems from a bodywide overreaction of the immune system, if other organs are suffering from the side effects of treatments, or if they are failing due to prolonged stays on ventilators.\nRead: Why some people get sicker than others\nPast coronavirus epidemics offer limited clues because they were so contained: Worldwide, only 10,600 or so people were ever diagnosed with SARS or MERS combined, which is less than the number of COVID-19 cases from Staten Island. “For new diseases, we don’t see 100 to 200 patients a week; it usually takes a whole career,” says Megan Coffee, an infectious-disease doctor at NYU Langone Health. And “if you see enough cases of other diseases, you’ll see unusual things.” During the flu pandemic of 2009, for example, doctors also documented heart, kidney, and neurological problems. “Is COVID-19 fundamentally different to other diseases, or is it just that you have a lot of cases at once?” asks Vinay Prasad, a hematologist and an oncologist at Oregon Health and Science University.\nPrasad’s concern is that COVID-19 has developed a clinical mystique—a perception that it is so unusual, it demands radically new approaches. “Human beings are notorious for our desire to see patterns,” he says. “Put that in a situation of fear, uncertainty, and hype, and it’s not surprising that there’s almost a folk medicine emerging.” Already, there are intense debates about giving patients blood thinners because so many seem to experience blood clots, or whether ventilators might do more harm than good. These issues may be important, and when facing new diseases, doctors must be responsive and creative. But they must also be rigorous. “Clinicians are under tremendous stress, which affects our ability to process information,” McLaren says. “‘Is this actually working, or does it seem to be working because I want it to work and I feel powerless?’”\nConsider hydroxychloroquine—the antimalarial drug that’s been repeatedly touted by the White House and conservative pundits as a COVID-19 “game changer.” The French studies that first suggested that the drug could treat COVID-19 were severely flawed, abandoning standard elements of solid science like randomly assigning patients to receive treatments or placebos, or including a control group to confirm if the drug offers benefits above normal medical care. The lead scientist behind those studies has railed against the “dictatorship of the methodologists,” as if randomization or controls were inconveniences that one should rebel against, rather than the backbone of effective medicine.\nRead: Why does the president keep pushing a malaria drug?\nLarger (but still preliminary) studies from the U.S., France, and China have cast doubt on hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness, and because it can cause heart problems, the National Institutes of Health has recommended against using it outside clinical trials. Those trials will offer clearer answers by the summer, and the drug may yet prove beneficial. For now, doctors are routinely prescribing it without knowing if it works or, crucially, if it does more harm than good. Meanwhile, people with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, who actually need hydroxychloroquine, can’t get it. It is not the case that every new study contributes to our understanding of COVID-19. Sloppy ones are a net negative, adding to the already considerable uncertainty by offering the illusion of confidence where none exists.\nIII. The Research\nSince the pandemic began, scientists have published more than 7,500 papers on COVID-19. But despite this deluge, “we haven’t seen a lot of huge plot twists,” says Carl Bergstrom, an epidemiologist and a sociologist of science at the University of Washington. The most important, he says, was the realization that people can spread the virus before showing symptoms. But even that insight was slow to dawn. A flawed German study hinted at it in early February, but scientific opinion shifted only after many lines of evidence emerged, including case reports, models showing that most infections are undocumented, and studies indicating that viral levels peak as symptoms appear.\nThis is how science actually works. It’s less the parade of decisive blockbuster discoveries that the press often portrays, and more a slow, erratic stumble toward ever less uncertainty. “Our understanding oscillates at first, but converges on an answer,” says Natalie Dean, a statistician at the University of Florida. “That’s the normal scientific process, but it looks jarring to people who aren’t used to it.”\nFor example, Stanford University researchers recently made headlines after testing 3,330 volunteers from Santa Clara County for antibodies against the new coronavirus. The team concluded that 2.5 to 4.2 percent of people have already been infected—a proportion much higher than the official count suggests. This, the authors claimed, means that the virus is less deadly than suspected, and that severe lockdowns may be overreactions—views they had previously espoused in opinion pieces. But other scientists, including statisticians, virologists, and disease ecologists, have criticized the study’s methods and the team’s conclusions.\nOne could write a long article assessing the Santa Clara study alone, but that would defeat the point: that individual pieces of research are extremely unlikely to single-handedly upend what we know about COVID-19. About 30 similar “serosurveys” have now been released. These and others to come could collectively reveal how many Americans have been infected. Even then, they would have to be weighed against other evidence, including accounts from doctors and nurses in New York or Lombardy, Italy, which clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 can crush health-care systems. The precise magnitude of the virus’s fatality rate is a matter of academic debate. The reality of what it can do to hospitals is not.\nThe scientific discussion of the Santa Clara study might seem ferocious to an outsider, but it is fairly typical for academia. Yet such debates might once have played out over months. Now they are occurring over days—and in full public view. Epidemiologists who are used to interacting with only their peers are racking up followers on Twitter. They have suddenly been thrust into political disputes. “People from partisan media outlets find this stuff and use a single study as a cudgel to beat the other side,” Bergstrom says. “The climate-change people are used to it, but we epidemiologists are not.”\nIn an earlier era, issues with the Santa Clara study would have been addressed during peer review—the process in which scientific work is assessed by other researchers before being published in a journal. But like many COVID-19 studies, this one was uploaded as a preprint—a paper that hasn’t yet run the peer-review gauntlet. Preprints allow scientists to share data quickly, and speed is vital in a pandemic: Several important studies were uploaded and discussed a full month before being published.\nPreprints also allow questionable work to directly enter public discourse, but that problem is not unique to them. The first flawed paper on hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19 was published in a peer-reviewed journal, whose editor in chief is one of the study’s co-authors. Another journal published a paper claiming that the new coronavirus probably originated in pangolins, after most virologists had considered and dismissed that idea.\nRead: Don’t believe the COVID-19 models\nMeanwhile, scientists are poring over preprints in open online spaces: The Santa Clara study may not have been formally peer-reviewed, but it has very much been reviewed by peers. It is easier than ever for journalists to assess how new research is being received, but only some are presenting these debates to their audience. Others are not. Some are even reporting on press-released research that hasn’t been uploaded as a preprint. “The rules for reporting on preprints shouldn’t be any different from reporting on journal articles,” the journalist Ivan Oransky told the media watchdog Health News Review. “Everything needs to be scrutinized beyond belief.”\nSuch scrutiny will become ever more necessary as the pandemic wears on. Julie Pfeiffer of UT Southwestern, who is an editor at the Journal of Virology, says that she and her colleagues have been flooded with submitted papers, most of which are so obviously poor that they haven’t even been sent out for review. “They shouldn’t be published anywhere,” she says, “and then they end up [on a preprint site].” Some come from nonscientists who have cobbled together a poor mathematical model; others come from actual virologists who have suddenly pivoted to studying coronaviruses and “are submitting work they never normally would in a rush to be first,” Pfeiffer says. “Some people are genuinely trying to help, but there’s also a huge amount of opportunism.”\nIV. The Experts\nLast month, the legal scholar Richard Epstein claimed that “the current organized panic in the United States does not seem justified” and that as the pandemic continued, “good news is more likely than bad.” His piece was widely circulated in conservative circles and the Trump administration. When asked about his lack of epidemiological training in an interview with The New Yorker’s Isaac Chotiner, Epstein responded, “One of the things you get as a lawyer is a skill of cross-examination. I spent an enormous amount of time over my career teaching medical people about some of this stuff.” His essay initially speculated that 500 Americans would die from COVID-19. He later updated that estimate to 5,000. So far, the death toll stands at 58,000, and is still rising.\nMany other non-epidemiologists seem to have similarly accrued expertise in the field. The military historian Victor Davis Hanson proffered the widely shared idea that the coronavirus has been spreading in California since last fall—a claim disproved by genetic studies showing that the earliest U.S. case likely arrived in January. During a White House meeting, the economist Peter Navarro reportedly pointed to a pile of hydroxychloroquine studies and said, “That’s science, not anecdote” to Anthony Fauci, who has worked in public health for five decades and directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The Silicon Valley technologist Aaron Ginn self-published an article on Medium called “Evidence Over Hysteria—COVID-19” that was viewed millions of times before being debunked by Bergstrom and taken down.\nRead: We are living in a failed state\nExpertise is not just about knowledge, but also about the capacity to spot errors. Ginn couldn’t see them in his own work; Bergstrom could. The rest of us are more likely to fall in the former group than the latter. We hunger for information, but lack the know-how to evaluate it or the sources that provide it. “This is the epistemological crisis of the moment: There’s a lot of expertise around, but fewer tools than ever to distinguish it from everything else,” says Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina and an Atlantic contributing writer. “Pure credentialism doesn’t always work. People have self-published a lot of terrible pieces on Medium, but some of the best early ones that explained stuff to laypeople were from tech guys.”\nBergstrom agrees that experts shouldn’t be dismissive gatekeepers. “There’s a lot of talent out there, and we need all hands on deck,” he says. For example, David Yu, a hockey analyst, created a tool that shows how predictions from the most influential COVID-19 model in the U.S. have changed over time. “Looking at that thing for, like, an hour helped me see things I hadn’t seen for three weeks,” Bergstrom says.\nA lack of expertise becomes problematic when it’s combined with extreme overconfidence, and with society’s tendency to reward projected confidence over humility. “When scientists offer caveats instead of absolutes,” Gralinski says, “that uncertainty we’re trained to acknowledge makes it sound like no one knows what’s going on, and creates opportunities for people who present as skeptics.” Science itself isn’t free from that dynamic, either. Through flawed mechanisms like the Nobel Prize, the scientific world elevates individuals for work that is usually done by teams, and perpetuates the myth of the lone genius. Through attention, the media reward voices that are outspoken but not necessarily correct. Those voices are disproportionately male.\nThe idea that there are no experts is overly glib. The issue is that modern expertise tends to be deep, but narrow. Even within epidemiology, someone who studies infectious diseases knows more about epidemics than, say, someone who studies nutrition. But pandemics demand both depth and breadth of expertise. To work out if widespread testing is crucial for controlling the pandemic, listen to public-health experts; to work out if widespread testing is possible, listen to supply-chain experts. To determine if antibody tests can tell people if they’re immune to the coronavirus, listen to immunologists; to determine if such testing is actually a good idea, listen to ethicists, anthropologists, and historians of science. No one knows it all, and those who claim to should not be trusted.\nIn a pandemic, the strongest attractor of trust shouldn’t be confidence, but the recognition of one’s limits, the tendency to point at expertise beyond one’s own, and the willingness to work as part of a whole. “One signature a lot of these armchair epidemiologists have is a grand solution to everything,” Bergstrom says. “Usually we only see that coming from enormous research teams from the best schools, or someone’s basement.”\nV. The Messaging\nIn the early months of the pandemic, while the coronavirus blazed through China, even veteran disease experts seemed to misjudge the odds that the epidemic would become a full-blown pandemic. On January 26, Fauci himself said the virus posed a “very, very low risk to the United States” and was a concern for public-health officials, but not the public. Many journalists offered similar reassurances, and frequently compared the coronavirus threat with the allegedly greater danger of flu.\nSome officials may have been motivated to avoid disproportionate panic, of the kind that gripped the U.S. during the Ebola outbreak of 2014. The instinct to be calm and measured is laudable—until it isn’t. “Alarmism is equated with misinformation, and a lot of it is misinformation. But when you do have something coming, no one feels empowered to say: ‘This one isn’t alarmism,’” Tufekci, the sociologist, says. “There’s a cultural script that we play, and when the script changes, it takes time to shift to a new one.”\nThe narrative that experts underplayed the risks isn’t fully correct, though. On January 26, Thomas Inglesby of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health tweeted, “We should be planning for the possibility that [the coronavirus] cannot be contained.” He followed with a list of recommendations, several of which—more diagnostics, more protective equipment, transparent communication—the U.S. is still struggling to meet. Four days later, Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA commissioner, and Luciana Borio, who was part of the National Security Council’s now-dissolved pandemic-preparedness office, similarly urged the government to “act now” to prevent an American epidemic. “I hope the lesson people take from this is not ‘Experts were wrong,’” Tufekci says. “If you followed the right people, they were overwhelmingly right. We just didn’t put them in the right place so we could hear them.”\nThe World Health Organization has also come under fire for hewing too closely to China’s position in January, and being too slow to confirm that the coronavirus was spreading among people, or to finally describe the situation as a pandemic. These issues should not detract from all that the WHO has done to contain the crisis. Nor should they provide cover for leaders who still failed to prepare their countries after the risks became clearer, and after being exhorted to act “aggressively” and “swiftly” by, well, the WHO. But the agency’s missteps do offer lessons for communicating in an emergency. In mid-January, it sent a now-infamous tweet describing “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus” without clearly discussing other important details, such as a new case in Thailand and warnings from Taiwan and Hong Kong. “They didn’t give the world the tells,” Tufekci says.\nRead: The WHO shouldn’t be a plaything for great powers\nThe same could be said of the White House and other U.S. officials who repeatedly assured Americans in January, February, and even March that their risk was low. That might have initially been true, Inglesby says, but officials should have noted that the true extent of the disease was unknown; that there wasn’t a way of measuring it, because tests weren’t in place; that the virus had already spread globally; and that control measures such as airport screening and travel bans have historically been unsuccessful. “The fuller statements take longer to explain, but that’s how it is in outbreaks.” Inglesby says. “There’s a lot of uncertainty, and we shouldn’t try to tidy it up.”\nIn late February, Nancy Messonnier, the respiratory-disease chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, broke ranks and told Americans that community spread of the virus within the U.S. was a question of when, not if. Messonnier urged the nation to prepare for possible school closures, loss of work, “disruption to everyday life that may be severe,” and “the expectation that this could be bad.” The next day, Trump asserted that cases were “going to be down to close to zero.” The day after, CDC Director Robert Redfield reiterated that “the risk is low,” and said that Messonnier could have been more articulate. Shortly after, Redfield said, “The American public needs to go on with their normal lives.” Of late, CDC officials, who were constant authoritative voices during past epidemics, have been mostly silent.\nThe impulse to be reassuring is understandable, but “the most important thing is to be as accurate as possible,” Inglesby says. “We should give people information so they can do what they think is right. We should tell people what we don’t know and when we’ll know more.” (The WHO is learning: On April 25, after wrongly tweeting that “there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from infection,” they offered a longer and more accurate explanation.)\nIf officials—and journalists—are clear about uncertainties from the start, the public can better hang new information onto an existing framework, and understand when shifting evidence leads to new policy. Otherwise, updates feel confusing. When the CDC suddenly reverses its position on wearing masks, without having previously clarified why the issue was so divisive, it seems like an arbitrary flip-flop. “That’s a dangerous way to communicate,” says Kate Starbird at the University of Washington, who studies how information flows during a crisis. “It contributes to diminishing trust in organizations. And when people don’t have a place they can go for trusted information, it makes them vulnerable to disinformation.”\nVI. The Information\nDuring news events like Trump’s impeachment trial, people mostly share information to signal their beliefs, says Renée DiResta of Stanford, who studies how narratives spread online. But in a disaster, people tend to share information “to be useful to their community,” she says. Sharing offers agency. It allows people to collectively make sense of a situation riddled by anxiety and uncertainty. “But when an earthquake happens, you talk to your neighbors and in a few days, you’ve figured out what’s going on,” Starbird says. “For COVID-19, the uncertainty is persistent.”\nThe pandemic’s length traps people in a liminal space. To clarify their uprooted life and indefinite future, they try to gather as much information as possible—and cannot stop. “We go seeking fresher and fresher information, and end up consuming unvetted misinformation that’s spreading rapidly,” Bergstrom says. Pandemics actually “unfold in slow motion,” he says, and “there’s no event that changes the whole landscape on a dime.” But it feels that way, because of how relentlessly we quest for updates. Historically, people would have struggled to find enough information. Now people struggle because they’re finding too much.\nRead: Trump’s dangerously effective coronavirus propaganda\nIt does not help that online information channels are heavily personalized and politicized, governed by algorithms that reward certain and extreme claims over correct but nuanced ones. On Twitter, false information spreads further than true information, and at six times the speed. But “this is not just a problem of the internet,” DiResta says. “For a lot of people, what is true is what the people I’ve chosen to trust in my community say is true.” Those dynamics meant that, at least initially, liberal and conservative Americans had very different understandings of the pandemic.\nAs the reality of the pandemic becomes clearer, the partisan gap is rapidly closing. But as time passes, misinformation, which refers to misleading stories that are circulated in good faith, will give way to disinformation—falsehoods deliberately seeded “to leverage the disaster for political power,” Starbird says. Amid the psychological loam of fear and uncertainty, conspiracy theories are germinating like weeds.\nThe daily briefings from the White House have only exacerbated the confusion. Trump has repeatedly tried to downplay the pandemic and rewrite his role in mishandling it. His playbook is his usual one: Deny responsibility, find a scapegoat, incite a culture war, and bend reality to his will by baldly stating his version of it (even when that version contradicts itself). The list of Trump’s lies about the coronavirus is long and growing, as are their consequences. His promotion of hydroxychloroquine led to shortages of the drug. His false claim that anyone who wants a test can get one sent droves of worried well to already-stretched hospitals.\nRead: The Trump presidency is over\nSeveral journalists and media critics have urged news networks to stop airing the White House briefings live. That seems extreme, but it’s an extreme time when a presidential briefing forces doctors to clarify that people should not consume bleach. “No matter how many tough questions you ask, it really is not possible to prevent him from spreading bad info that could have very serious health effects,” says Jay Rosen, a journalism professor at NYU. “People think that more determined journalists can solve the problem—and they can’t.”\nRosen also argues that the media’s default rhythm of constant piecemeal updates is ill-suited to covering an event as large as the pandemic. “Journalists still think of their job as producing new content, but if your goal is public understanding of COVID-19, one piece of new content after another doesn’t get you there,” he says. “It requires a lot of background knowledge to understand the updates, and the news system is terrible at [providing that knowledge].” Instead, the staccato pulse of reports merely amplifies the wobbliness of the scientific process, turns incremental bits of evidence into game changers, and intensifies the already-palpable sense of uncertainty that drives people toward misinformation.\nIf the media won’t change, its consumers might have to. Starbird recommends slowing down and taking a moment to vet new information before sharing it. She herself is spending less time devouring every scrap of pandemic news, and more time with local sources. It’s the equivalent, she says, of “hand-washing for the infodemic.” And it might dispel the illusion that the pandemic can be tracked in real time.\nVII. The Numbers\nThe rapid pace of new information creates the sense that we can accurately monitor the pandemic as it happens. But daily numbers tell a distorted story. As April wears on, case counts suggest that the pandemic is plateauing in parts of the U.S. But it’s hard to know for sure. As my colleagues Robinson Meyer and Alexis Madrigal have reported, 20 percent of Americans who are tested for the coronavirus are still getting positive results. This figure is higher than almost every other developed country and has held steady over time. It suggests that the U.S. is still mostly testing people who are very likely to be infected and is still missing the majority of cases. If so, cases could have leveled off because the U.S. has maxed out its ability to find infected people.\nThis concern complicates the government’s plan to start reopening the country after a “downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period.” If the case number is illusory, this criterion is meaningless. “I’d want to know that we’re doing enough testing to be confident that those numbers really are stabilizing,” says Dean, the University of Florida statistician. “I’m still not convinced we’re in a good place.”\nWhen looking at case counts, remember this: Those numbers do not show how many people have been infected on any given day. They reflect the number of tests that were done (which is still insufficient), the lag in reporting results from those tests (which can be long), and the proportion of tests that are incorrectly negative (which seems high). Likewise, daily death counts do not offer a real-time glimpse at the virus’s toll. Because of delays in reporting, they tend to be lower on weekends.\nDeaths are hard to tally in general, and the process differs among diseases. The CDC estimates that flu kills 24,000 to 62,000 Americans every year, a number that seems superficially similar to the 58,000 COVID-19 deaths thus far. That comparison is misleading. COVID-19 deaths are counted based either on a positive diagnostic test for the coronavirus or on clinical judgment. Flu deaths are estimated through a model that looks at hospitalizations and death certificates, and accounts for the possibility that many deaths are due to flu but aren’t coded as such. If flu deaths were counted like COVID-19 deaths, the number would be substantially lower. This doesn’t mean we’re overestimating the flu. It does mean we are probably underestimating COVID-19.\nThe means of gathering data always complicate the interpretation of those data. Consider the reports that the coronavirus can “reactivate” in recovered patients, or that people can become “reinfected.” This really means that patients are testing positive for the virus after having tested negative. But that might have nothing to do with the virus, and everything to do with the test. Diagnostic tests for COVID-19 produce a lot of false negatives, incorrectly telling 15 to 30 percent of infected people that they’re in the clear. And even if these tests were better, the viral levels of a recovering patient would eventually fall below their threshold of accuracy. When such patients are sequentially tested, some will toggle between negative and positive results, creating the appearance of reinfection.\nFalse positives are a problem, too. Many companies and countries have pinned their hopes on antibody tests, which purportedly show whether someone has been infected by the coronavirus. One such test claims to correctly identify people with those antibodies 93.8 percent of the time. By contrast, it identifies phantom antibodies in 4.4 percent of people who don’t have them. That false-positive rate sounds acceptably low. It’s not. Let’s assume 5 percent of the U.S. has been infected so far. Among 1,000 people, the test would correctly identify antibodies in 47 of the 50 people who had them. But it would also wrongly spot antibodies in 42 of the 950 people without them. The number of true positives and false positives would be almost equal. In this scenario, if you were told you had coronavirus antibodies, your odds of actually having them would be little better than a coin toss.\nRead: No testing, no treatment, no herd immunity, no easy way out\nNone of this means that all bets are off and the pandemic is unquantifiable. The case count might be wrong, but it’s almost certainly too low rather than too high, and it’s more likely off by a factor of 10 than 100. The numbers still matter; they’re just messy and hard to interpret, especially in the moment. On my phone, I can see weather patterns, the position of every plane in the sky, and the number of people currently reading this article, all in real time. But I cannot get the same immediate information about the pandemic. The numbers I see say as much about the tools researchers are using as the quantities they are measuring. “I think people underestimate how difficult it is to measure things,” Dean says. “For us who work in public health, measuring things is, like, 80 percent of the problem.”\nIf measuring the present is hard, predicting the future is even harder. The mathematical models that have guided the world’s pandemic responses have been often portrayed as crystal balls. That is not their purpose. They instead describe a range of possibilities, and help scientists and policy makers to simulate what might happen pending different courses of action. Models reveal many possible fates, and allow us to choose one. And while distant projections are necessarily blurry, the path ahead is not unknowable. “The long-term is like modeling the trajectory of a falling leaf, but the short-term is like modeling a falling bowling ball,” says Dylan Morris, an infectious-disease modeler at Princeton. Uncertainties about the year ahead shouldn’t cloud “how devastatingly and terrifyingly certain we can be” about the immediate consequences if the pandemic isn’t controlled, he adds.\nVIII. The Narrative\nIn the final second of December 31, 1999, clocks ticked into a new millennium, and … not much happened. The infamous Y2K bug, a quirk of computer code that was predicted to cause global chaos, did very little. Twenty years later, Y2K is almost synonymous with overreaction—a funny moment when humanity freaked out over nothing. But it wasn’t nothing. It actually was a serious problem, which never fully materialized because a lot of people worked very hard to prevent it. “There are two lessons one can learn from an averted disaster,” Tufekci says. “One is: That was exaggerated. The other is: That was close.”\nLast month, a team at Imperial College London released a model that said the coronavirus pandemic could kill 2.2 million Americans if left unchecked. So it was checked. Governors and mayors closed businesses and schools, banned large gatherings, and issued stay-at-home orders. These social-distancing measures were rolled out erratically and unevenly, but they seem to be working. The death toll is still climbing, but seems unlikely to hit the worst-case 2.2 million ceiling. That was close. Or, as some pundits are already claiming, that was exaggerated.\nThe coronavirus is not unlike the Y2K bug—a real but invisible risk. When a hurricane or an earthquake hits, the danger is evident, the risk self-explanatory, and the aftermath visible. It is obvious when to take shelter, and when it’s safe to come out. But viruses lie below the threshold of the senses. Neither peril nor safety is clear. Whenever I go outside for a brief (masked) walk, I reel from cognitive dissonance as I wander a world that has been irrevocably altered but that looks much the same. I can still read accounts of people less lucky—those who have lost, and those who have been lost. But I cannot read about the losses that never occurred, because they were averted. Prevention may be better than cure, but it is also less visceral.\nThe coronavirus not only co-opts our cells, but exploits our cognitive biases. Humans construct stories to wrangle meaning from uncertainty and purpose from chaos. We crave simple narratives, but the pandemic offers none. The facile dichotomy between saving either lives or the economy belies the broad agreement between epidemiologists and economists that the U.S. shouldn’t reopen prematurely. The lionization of health-care workers and grocery-store employees ignores the risks they are being asked to shoulder and the protective equipment they aren’t being given. The rise of small anti-lockdown protests overlooks the fact that most Republicans and Democrats agree that social distancing should continue “for as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus.”\nRead: How the pandemic will end\nAnd the desire to name an antagonist, be it the Chinese Communist Party or Donald Trump, disregards the many aspects of 21st-century life that made the pandemic possible: humanity’s relentless expansion into wild spaces; soaring levels of air travel; chronic underfunding of public health; a just-in-time economy that runs on fragile supply chains; health-care systems that yoke medical care to employment; social networks that rapidly spread misinformation; the devaluation of expertise; the marginalization of the elderly; and centuries of structural racism that impoverished the health of minorities and indigenous groups. It may be easier to believe that the coronavirus was deliberately unleashed than to accept the harsher truth that we built a world that was prone to it, but not ready for it.\nIn the classic hero’s journey—the archetypal plot structure of myths and movies—the protagonist reluctantly departs from normal life, enters the unknown, endures successive trials, and eventually returns home, having been transformed. If such a character exists in the coronavirus story, it is not an individual, but the entire modern world. The end of its journey and the nature of its final transformation will arise from our collective imagination and action. And they, like so much else about this moment, are still uncertain."}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/finnair_passengers_with_covid-19_symptoms_will_be_barred_from_flights/11270236", "title": "Finnair : Passengers with Covid - 19 symptoms will be barred from flights", "text": "Finnair: Passengers with Covid-19 symptoms will be barred from flights\nThe announcement came as the airline laid on extra flights to bring home Finnish citizens and residents still abroad.\nNational air carrier Finnair said on Sunday that it will not board passengers with symptoms that suggest they have Covid-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus.\nIt said that passengers boarding flights to return to Finland will also be checked to ensure that they can withstand the physical stress of air travel.\nPassengers who begin to display symptoms during the flight will be isolated and the flight crew will alert local authorities, the carrier said.\nAt the same time, Finnair called on returning passengers to retreat to conditions similar to self-quarantine for two weeks once they arrive in Finland.\nThe announcement came as the airline revealed plans to lay on extra flights to bring Finnish citizens and residents home from holiday locations in Spain and Turkey.\n\"It is very important that people understand their own responsibilities and do not board flights while they are sick,\" Finnair communications director Päivyt Tallqvist."}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/02/workers-disinfect-south-korea-department-store-as-covid-19-spreads", "title": "Workers disinfect South Korea department store as COVID - 19 spreads", "text": "With the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases spiking over 4,000, a South Korean department store continued its disinfection efforts on Monday.\nEmployees cleaned the shop, in the western part of Seoul, as customers lined up outside to be first in the queue to buy masks which are sold out in many parts of the country.\nLike other Asian nations, South Koreans have long worn face masks to prevent spreading colds or alleviate allergies.\nThat practice has grown more widespread since the recent outbreak of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19."}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/business/china-slowdown-biggest-in-30-years-mm08x00d2", "title": "China slowdown  biggest in 30 year | Business", "text": "China slowdown ‘biggest in 30 years’\nThe Chinese economy is on course to suffer its worst quarterly performance since the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 because of the coronavirus outbreak, economists have said.\nChinese officials cut a key medium-term interest rate yesterday, pumping more liquidity into the system and raising hopes of further stimulus to curb the economic impact of Covid-19, the official name for the latest coronavirus.

", "text": "Climate change: Could the coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery?\n-\n- Science & Environment\nThe Covid-19 lockdown has cut climate change emissions - for now. But some governments want to go further by harnessing their economic recovery plans to boost low-carbon industries. Their slogan is \"Build Back Better\", but can they succeed?\nI've just had a light bulb moment. The feisty little wren chirping loudly in the matted ivy outside my back door is telling us something important about global climate change.\nThat's because, intertwined with the melodious notes of a robin, I can actually hear its song clearly.\nNormally, both birds are muffled by the insistent rumble of traffic, but the din has been all but extinguished in the peace of lockdown.\nThe drop in traffic is a major contributor to the fall in planet-warming CO2 emissions we've witnessed globally.\n- Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB) (PDF, 10.4MB)\n- Covid recovery plan 'must tackle climate change'\n- Don't forget 'deeper emergency', says UN chief\n- Blue skies pushed Greenland 'into the red'\nBefore the Covid-19 crisis, we accepted the dominance of traffic noise as an inevitable consequence of city living.\nNow, we have sampled an alternative urban ambience.\nGovernments currently face a stark choice: bail out polluting businesses, using that as leverage to impose environmentally-minded reforms, or let them return to their carbon-intensive activities as an economic quick fix.\nBut many members of the public have little desire to return to the state of affairs before lockdown.\nIn a poll, a fifth of members of the motoring group the AA, said they would work more from home in future.\nThis has implications for the UK government's £28bn road-building programme which assumes that traffic will rise by 1% per year - a conjecture that now looks unlikely.\nThe stay-at-home trend will be offset somewhat by nervous public transport users shunning trains for fear of infection, and by long-distance commuters who might decide that if they only need to visit the office three days a week, they'll buy a home even further away.\nThe AA, which for years was seen as the voice of motorists, has asked the government to think again about its £28bn road expansion. Its president, Edmund King, has suggested the money would be better spent on improving broadband\nAnother likely winner from the crisis is the movement fighting to turn city streets over to pedestrians and cyclists.\nThis has already happened in places like Paris, which is rolling out 650km of \"corona cycle-ways\", and Milan, which has a programme to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists.\nThe determination to seize the moment for environmental change stretches further than the transport sector.\nThe UK is one of several nations looking to reboot its environmental strategy by calling in favours from private industry. After all, it was government which bailed out employers when the crunch came in March. The catchphrase is \"Build Back Better\".\nBut it would seem to face a direct challenge in the shape of China and the US. The economies of both these superpowers have been savaged by the effects of coronavirus.\nThey are desperate to get back to pre-virus levels of output, so their leaders may think the surest means of doing so is through tried and trusted climate warming fossil fuels.\nFor those seeking a greener way out of the Covid-19 slump, renewable energy will help, along with electric vehicle charging points and broadband.\nFrans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission, is on the same track. He is leading work on a Green Deal to make the EU's economy sustainable and says that not a single Euro should be spent propping up old, dirty industries.\nAll Covid-19 recovery investment should go towards commerce that either helps reduce carbon emissions or promotes digital business, he insists.\nBut some MEPs from parties on the right warn that the pandemic will have \"far-reaching\" economic and social consequences.\nThey insist the EU must scale back its pre-crisis climate ambitions.\nThat's led some governments, like Germany and the UK, to offer hand-outs to polluting industries without imposing green conditions.\nIn the UK, the issue is causing contortions among politicians torn between saving existing jobs and conserving the planet.\nMPs from the Liberal Democrats - thought of as one of the \"greenest\" UK parties - have joined other parliamentarians in demanding a conditional rescue for the airline industry.\nThey say that if ministers don't step in, tens of thousands of jobs will be lost.\nBut the firms should promise to off-set their emissions by, for example, planting trees.\nOff-setting is hugely contentious. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, argues: \"Any government bailout should focus on workers, not the industry itself.\n\"It should be conditional on the industry agreeing to shrink until - if ever - low-carbon technology is available - which isn't now.\"\nOne direction?\nThat begs a question: which industries should qualify for support? Should cash go exclusively to self-evidently green sectors like solar power - or to dirty firms trying to clean up?\nTake the fossil fuel firms that pay our pension dividends by drilling for the stuff that's over-heating the world.\nThe UK's oil and gas industry warns that 30,000 jobs could be lost because of the pandemic and the current low oil price.\nBut why would governments support a commodity that's fuelling the climate crisis, which is judged by the UN to be deeper than the Covid-19 crisis?\nPerhaps it's not that simple. Lord Stern, the former Treasury chief who's now a climate expert, told me each firm should be judged on its trajectory, not on its current state.\n\"The oil and gas industries are producing stuff you want to run down very quickly,\" he said. \"But you do see some companies - like BP and Shell - which are declaring they are moving in a direction where they want to be going zero carbon.\n\"So, you can't be indiscriminate or dogmatic. You have to look where the industry is going.\"\nAt least UK environmentalists are dealing with firms that agree on the need to tackle climate change.\nIn the US, some fossil fuel firms have been determined to pursue government bail-outs without strings binding them to a less polluting future.\nThe Democratic Party has a long-standing proposal for a \"Green New Deal\" to promote clean technology. But President Donald Trump has minimised the importance of climate change. He has promised to help struggling fossil fuel firms, although his efforts have not taken root in a major way.\nHe tweeted:\nThen there's China. In 2015, its leaders were persuaded by President Barack Obama to make major climate change commitments as part of the Paris climate agreement.\nSince then, China has suffered job losses and fuel shortages. Beijing has resorted to a quick fix for the economy by building coal-fired power plants.\nThe green think tank Global Energy Monitor says the number of plants China approved in the first three weeks of March 2020 - equivalent to 7,960 megawatts (MW) - was more than the number agreed in the whole of 2019 (6,310 MW).\n- A SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?\n- AVOIDING CONTACT: The rules on self-isolation and exercise\n- HOPE AND LOSS: Your coronavirus stories\n- LOOK-UP TOOL: Check cases in your area\n- TESTING: Can I get tested for coronavirus?\nThat doesn't take into account China's estimated $1 trillion investment in its \"Belt and Road\" initiative to build huge, carbon-intensive infrastructure projects across developing countries.\nUnless China and President Trump change their spots (or the Democratic candidate wins the US election), Europe's Build Back Better campaign won't be enough to protect the increasingly fragile climate, even if it does engineer a green recovery.\nAnd we have a lesson from history. Nick Robins from the London School of Economics (LSE) estimates that in the global financial crisis of 2008 just 16% of global stimulus plans were green - mainly because China invested massively in fossil fuel projects.\nHe tells me: \"If we have any hope of combating climate change, we must make absolutely sure we do it better this time.\"\nFollow Roger on Twitter.\n- What is climate change?\n- Climate-related words and phrases explained\n- How much warmer is your city?\n- What is your diet's carbon footprint?\n- Where we are in seven charts\nWhat questions do you have about the environment and Covid-19?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

The companies aim to offer the maximum public health benefit without sacrificing individual privacy.\nWhat's next: Apple and Google are implementing the necessary software in two phases.\n- In mid-May, the companies will update their operating system to support the contact-sharing technique and allow for contact-tracing apps.\n- In the coming months, a further operating system update will allow the system to work with out needing a specific app.\nHow it works:\n- Google and Apple are both making changes to their mobile operating systems to let devices exchange a private key with nearby smartphones via Bluetooth, logging any time users come in close proximity.\n- If someone tests positive for COVID-19 and enters that information into an app, 14 days worth of their contacts with other users are sent to a server.\n- Phones periodically check if any recently encountered user has reported being infected. If so, a notification pops up letting the user know that someone they have been in contact with has tested positive and more information is provided.\n- The new technology will work on iPhones running iOS 13 or later and on Android devices running any version of the operating system from 2015's Marshmallow on.\nThe companies say they have taken a number of steps to protect user privacy, including:\n- Allowing individual choice whether to use the technology.\n- Not collecting location or other personally identifiable information.\n- Not allowing the actual list of people a user has been in contact with to leave the phone unless desired.\n- Pledging the tool will only be used for contact tracing by public health authorities for COVID-19 pandemic management.\n- Not identifying people who test positive to other users, Google or Apple.\n- Retaining the ability to disable the broadcast system on a region-by-region basis when it is no longer needed.\nThe bottom line: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Robert Redfield, echoing other public health officials from around the globe, told NPR Thursday that contact tracing is vital to curbing the spread of the coronavirus and preventing recurring localized outbreaks.\n- \"It is going to be critical,\" he said. \"We can't afford to have multiple community outbreaks that can spiral up into sustained community transmission — so it is going to be very aggressive, what I call 'block and tackle,' 'block and tackle.'\""}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-france-announces-first-covid-19-death-in-europe/a-52386140", "title": "Coronavirus : France announces first COVID - 19 death in Europe | News | DW", "text": "The French health minister has reported the first death from COVID-19 in Europe.

Earlier the country had identified 16 new cases, with authorities in the north ordering the closure of schools, bars and other public spaces in 10 towns. More than 50,000 people have been asked to stay at home, while all public activities such as church masses and sporting events have been banned for up to a week.\nIranian health authorities reported two fatalities on Friday, according to Mehr news agency, adding to the two elderly patients who died on Wednesday. A further 14 people tested positive for the virus.\nThe outbreak in Iran began in the city of Qom, an often-visited religious destination. The health ministry official Minou Mohrez warned it had since spread to several cities, including the capital, Tehran, according to the official IRNA news agency.\n“It’s possible that it exists in all cities in Iran,” she said, adding the source of the virus was likely a Chinese worker in Qom.\nAs the country held a parliamentary election on Friday, state television showed voters in Qom wearing surgical masks. Earlier this week, authorities closed all schools in the city as a precaution and called for the suspension of religious gatherings.\nThe threat posed is especially concerning in Iran after several years of tightening US sanctions by the Trump administration that have dangerously undermined the domestic health care system. In addition, the sharp devaluation of the Iranian rial makes it extremely unlikely its government would be able to throw the resources at an epidemic as witnessed in China.\nTo prevent infections, neighbouring Iraq shut its land crossings with Iran. However, the virus already appears to have leaked out of the country and across international borders.\nIn Lebanon, the health minister, Hamad Hassan, reported the country’s first case of the virus on Friday, stating the patient was a 45-year-old woman who arrived on Thursday on a flight from Qom.\nAt a news conference in Beirut, he said the ministry was also following up on the cases of two other suspected cases.\nThe new coronavirus, which causes the illness recently named by the WHO as Covid-19, has infected more than 76,000 people in 27 countries and led to more than 2,200 deaths since December.\nThere have been only a few cases in the Middle East so far. Nine have been confirmed in the United Arab Emirates, seven of whom are Chinese nationals, and one in Egypt.\nIn Israel, the health ministry announced the country’s first case, saying the patient was an Israeli woman who had been quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.\nThe ship was carrying more than 3,700 people in early February, when 10 passengers were diagnosed with Covid-19. Since it was docked and quarantined in the port of Yokohama, a total of 634 passengers and crew have been infected, with two people dying.\nEleven Israelis who initially tested negative were flown home by chartered plane overnight on Thursday. However, on arrival, a woman failed a breath sample check, the ministry said, and was immediately moved to a special isolation unit at a hospital near Tel Aviv.\nThe repatriation of people from the Diamond Princess, as well as parts of China and other countries affected by the coronavirus, has caused fears of outbreaks on their return.\nIn Ukraine, protesters on Thursday attacked buses carrying 45 Ukrainians and 27 other evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the virus’ centre, to the small town of Novi Sanzhary, fearing they would be a health hazard.\nVideos showed dozens of protesters lighting tires ablaze and hurling rocks at the buses carrying the evacuees. Riot police broke up the crowds and detained 24 people.\nThe Ukrainian government has planned to quarantine the people at a sanatorium there for two weeks. In an attempt to calm the demonstrators, the health minister, Zoryana Skaletska, pledged to spend the next two weeks in the same sanatorium.\nA selfie she posted from her room in quarantine was followed by the hashtags calling on Ukrainians “not to fear our own” and “I am not afraid of the virus, I am with you”.\nIn Italy, as well as the death of the 78-year-old man, 15 other coronavirus cases have been confirmed. Several towns in the northern Lombardy region, where 14 of the cases were detected, are under lockdown after officials warned residents to stay home and avoid social contact.\nThe fatality and the other case are in the Veneto region.\nThe first locally transmitted case in Italy was that of a 38-year-old Italian man, who contracted the disease after meeting a colleague who had recently returned from China. He is in intensive care. His pregnant wife is also infected, as is a person who played sport with the man. Italian media reported that three other cases were in elderly people who frequented a bar in the Lombardy town of Codogno, near Lodi, that is owned by the father of the man who played sport with the 38-year-old.\nGiulio Gallera, Lombardy’s welfare councillor, said the other eight cases included five health workers and three patients at Codogno hospital.\n“There have already been clusters of the virus in Germany and France,” said Roberto Speranza, the health minister.\n“Italy is ready. We had already prepared a plan because it was evident that what has happened could happen. Now it’s a question of applying the plan. Clearly this plan features immediate decisions for the areas of the outbreak in order to limit it.\n• This article was amended on 24 February 2020.

", "text": "One hundred years ago, a world recovering from a global war that had killed some 20 million people suddenly had to contend with something even more deadly: a flu outbreak.\nThe pandemic, which became known as Spanish flu, is thought to have begun in cramped and crowded army training camps on the Western Front. The unsanitary conditions – especially in the trenches along the French border – helped it incubate and then spread. The war ended in November 1918, but as the soldiers returned home, bringing the virus with them, an even greater loss of life was just around the corner; between 50 million and 100 million people are thought to have died.\nThe world has suffered many pandemics in the years since – at least three serious flu outbreaks among them – but no pandemic has been as deadly, nor as far-reaching.\nAs the world reacts to a headline-grabbing – yet far, far less deadly – outbreak of Covid-19, caused by a new coronavirus, BBC Future looks back to our 2018 special marking the 100th anniversary of Spanish Flu to see what we learned from one of the most devastating diseases in recent history.\nPneumonia is often the killer\nMany of the people dying from Covid-19 are succumbing to a form of pneumonia, which takes hold as the immune system is weakened from fighting the virus.\nThis is something that it shares with Spanish flu – though it must be said that the death rate from Covid-19 is many times lower than that of Spanish flu. Older people and those with compromised immune systems – who make up the majority of those who have been killed by the disease so far – are more susceptible to infections that cause pneumonia.\nRead more: The flu that changed the world\nFew places escaped\nAir travel was in its infancy when Spanish flu struck. But there are few places on Earth that escaped its horrific effects. Its passage across the world was slower, carried by railway and passenger steamer rather by airliners. Some places held out for months, or even years, before the flu arrived and wreaked its terrible toll.\nThe coronavirus, though capturing public attention, is significantly less lethal than Spanish Flu (Credit: Getty Images)\nBut some places did manage to keep the flu at bay, often by using basic techniques that are still being used 100 years later. In Alaska, one community on Bristol Bay escaped the flu almost unscathed. They closed schools, banned public gatherings, and shut off access to the village from the main road. It was a low-tech version of the travel restrictions that have been used in some areas today, such as China’s Hubei province and northern Italy, in an effort to stop the coronavirus spreading.\nRead more: The places that escaped the Spanish Flu\nDifferent viruses target different populations\nDoctors have described the Spanish flu as the “greatest medical holocaust in history”. It was not just the fact it killed so many, it was that so many of its victims were young and healthy. Normally, a healthy immune system can deal reasonably well with flu, but this version struck so quickly that it overwhelmed the immune system, causing a massive over-reaction known as a cytokine storm, flooding the lungs with fluid which became the perfect reservoir for secondary infections. Older people, interestingly, were not as susceptible, perhaps because they had survived a very similar strain of flu which had started to spread through human populations in the 1830s.\nThe flu spurred the development of public health systems across the developed world, as scientists and governments realised pandemics would spread more quickly\nWith the new coronavirus, the elderly and people with pre-existing illnesses are considered to be most at risk. Although still low, deaths have been highest in those aged above 80 years old.\nRead more: Why was Spanish Flu so deadly?\nPublic health is the best defence\nThe Spanish flu broke out in a world which had just come out of a global war, with vital public resources diverted to military efforts. The idea of a public health system was its infancy – in many places, only the middle class or the rich could afford to visit a doctor. The flu killed many in slums and other poor urban areas, among populations with poor nutrition and sanitation, and often those with underlying health conditions.\nThe flu spurred the development of public health systems across the developed world, as scientists and governments realised pandemics would spread more quickly than they had in the past.\nMasks were in high demand during the Spanish Flu outbreak as well (Credit: Getty Images)\nTreating people on a case-by-case basis would not be enough – to deal with pandemics in urban settings, governments would have to mobilise resources as if they were at war, quarantining those showing signs of the disease, keeping minor cases separate to those suffering more serious illness, and limiting people’s movements so the disease would burn itself out.\nThe public health measures we see being enacted today across the world as efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus are one of the Spanish flu’s most enduring effects.\nRead more: What if pandemic influenza broke out today?\n--\nAs an award-winning science site, BBC Future is committed to bringing you evidence-based analysis and myth-busting stories around the new coronavirus.

Together, just three “major countries” alone — Russia, Germany and Italy — have tested more people than the U.S. And on another measure, more than 30 countries have tested a larger share of the population than the U.S. has done.\nHis statements came after a week in which his unproven ideas for fighting COVID-19 such as injecting disinfectants into people triggered an outcry from health officials everywhere. Trump also gave weight through his bully pulpit to an unproved theory that heat and humidity might hasten the destruction of the coronavirus,\nFollowing his clashes with scientific experts, the White House is now taking steps to shift the president’s public focus to efforts aimed at easing the economic devastation caused by the pandemic.\nA look at the past week’s rhetoric, including those from his veterans affairs secretary:\nTESTING\nTRUMP: “We have now Tested more than 5 Million People. That is more than any other country in the World, and even more than all major countries combined!” — tweet Saturday.\nTHE FACTS: Actually, the U.S. has tested far fewer people than “major countries combined” and lags dozens of countries in testing its population proportionally. Governors around the nation have stressed their decisions about lifting stay-at-home orders rest in part on the availability of testing and understanding the scope of how much the respiratory disease has spread.\nTogether, just three major countries -- Russia, Germany and Italy -- have tested about 6.5 million people, compared with over 5 million in the U.S. And the United States is easily outdistanced when testing in other Group of Seven countries is added to the mix, as well as powers such as India. Moreover, the count does not include China, which has more than four times the population of the U.S. but has not published national testing numbers.\nMore than 30 other countries have tested a larger share of the population than has been done in the U.S., which was slow to make COVID-19 diagnoses available and still can’t offer it to everyone who might be infected.\n___\nDISINFECTANT\nTRUMP, on the virus: “I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that ... you’re going to have to use medical doctors ... but it sounds — it sounds interesting to me.” — briefing Thursday.\nTHE FACTS: No.\nThe fact Trump would even flirt with the idea prompted a statement from Reckitt Benckiser, parent company of the maker of Lysol and Dettol, that “under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).”\nClorox echoed that bleach and other disinfectants “are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.”\nThe U.S. surgeon general’s office moved to discourage people from thinking they can self-medicate from something in the house: “PLEASE always talk to your health provider first before administering any treatment/medication to yourself or a loved one.”\nAs the blowback unfolded, Trump said Friday he was being sarcastic the day before.\n___\nSUNLIGHT & HEAT\nTRUMP, on an unproved theory that sunlight, heat and humidity can destroy the virus faster than inside the house: “I hope people enjoy the sun.

And if heat is good, and if sunlight is good, that’s a great thing as far as I’m concerned.” — briefing Thursday.\nTHE FACTS: Sunlight may be a disinfectant for the spirit and outdoor exercise is recommended in today’s social isolation, but there’s no proof it will make the pandemic go away. Without declaring that it would, Trump is again giving traction to a theory that could prompt people to let down their guard around others outside.\nWlliam Bryan, who leads the Homeland Security Department’s science and technology directorate, told the briefing about incomplete, “emerging results” from research that suggest solar light, heat and humidity might be effective at neutralizing the virus. Past studies have not found good evidence of that.\nDr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s emergencies chief, said in March that “it’s a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza.” Trump said early in the outbreak he expected it to end with the warmer weather of April.\n___\nROUND 2\nTRUMP, on the chances of the virus returning in the fall: “If it does come back — it’s not going to come back — and I’ve spoken to 10 different people, it’s not going to be like it was. ... If we have embers of corona coupled with the flu, that’s not going to be pleasant, but it’s not going to be what we’ve gone through in any way, shape or form. ... You may not even have corona coming back, just so you understand.” — briefing Wednesday.\nTHE FACTS: His public health officials refuted his statement on the spot that the coronavirus won’t be coming back. As for his statement that it won’t be as bad in a second round, that’s more complicated.\n“There will be coronavirus in the fall,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said at the briefing. “I am convinced of that because of the degree of transmissibility that it has, the global nature.”\n“Next fall and winter, we’re going to have two viruses circulating, and we’re going to have to distinguish between which is flu and which is the coronavirus,” said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHow bad that will be will be determined by a range of factors that can’t be predicted with precision. Redfield said the situation may be more difficult than now because the coronavirus and the flu will be circulating at the same time, unlike during the bulk of the current pandemic. Or it may be less difficult if preparations and containment are better than now.\n___\nMALARIA DRUG\nVA SECRETARY ROBERT WILKIE, asked whether it’s safe to encourage people to take hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment: “Oh, I think so.” — interview Wednesday on MSNBC.\nTHE FACTS: That’s not what the government’s top health experts have said for weeks, nor what his own agency has suggested. A new alert Friday from the Food and Drug Administration further underscored why the drug cannot be considered generally safe in this pandemic and why it has not been approved by the FDA for treatment of COVID-19.\nLast month, the FDA authorized the narrow emergency use of the malaria drugs for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who aren’t enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. But regulators said they are investigating life-threatening side effects reported to poison control centers and other health authorities.\nIn one such report, doctors at a New York hospital said that heart rhythm abnormalities developed in most of the 84 coronavirus patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin, a combination Trump has promoted as part of his persistent and inaccurate portrayal of the malaria drug as a game-changer.\nThe drug has long been used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. A few, very small preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent the coronavirus from entering cells and possibly help patients clear the virus sooner.\nWilkie, as VA secretary, leads the nation’s largest health system. His agency’s own health care arm has criticized premature assessments on the effectiveness of the drug for the coronavirus. In an unsigned response to an audit report last month examining whether the VA had adequate stocks of the drug, top VA health officials called it “inaccurate and irresponsible” to assume hydroxychloroquine would benefit veterans for COVID-19.\n“There are active investigations into these drugs and many others, as discussed by Dr. Anthony Fauci,” according to the unsigned VA response to the agency’s inspector general. “Yet no conclusions have been made on their effectiveness. To insist that a 14 days’ supply of these drugs is appropriate or not appropriate displays this dangerous lack of expertise on COVID-19 and Pandemic response.”\n___\nWILKIE, on a nationwide study finding that a malaria drug had no benefit for treating COVID-19 among veterans: “That’s an observational study. It’s not a clinical study. It was done on a small number of veterans. Sadly, those of whom were in the last stages of life. And the drug was given to them. And I have to also say that the drug — we know the drug has been working on middle-age and younger veterans ... working in stopping the progression of the disease.” — MSNBC interview.\nTHE FACTS: He mischaracterized the study’s finding.\nWilkie rejected a study that relies on his department’s own hospital data and finds no benefit from hydroxychloroquine. His claim that it helps younger or middle-aged veterans with COVID-19 is also unsubstantiated.\nIt’s true that the study, done by independent researchers at two universities with VA approval, was not a rigorous experiment. Yet with 368 patients, it’s the largest look so far at hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, based on VA hospital data.\nResearchers analyzed medical records of male veterans hospitalized with confirmed coronavirus infection at Veterans Health Administration medical centers who died or were discharged by April 11.\nAbout 28% who were given hydroxychloroquine plus usual care died, versus 11% of those getting routine care alone.\nEven though people given the drug tended to be sicker than the comparison group, researchers statistically adjusted for that and still saw no benefit from the drug.\nThere is no other published evidence that the drug is safe or effective for younger veterans with COVID-19.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Marilynn Marchione in Milwaukee and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report.\n___\nEDITOR’S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.\n___\nFind AP Fact Checks at https://apnews.com/APFactCheck\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck"}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coming-to-a-screen-two-metres-from-you-coronavirus-the-movie-p6njss8xq", "title": "Coming to a screen two metres from you , Coronavirus the movie", "text": "Coming to a screen two metres from you, Coronavirus — the movie\nFilm and television writers are rushing out stories of microbial disaster to exploit a captive audience\nYou have washed your hands, kept your distance, travelled only essentially and done your best to help the NHS.

National infection rates were also down.\nZhong Nanshan, an epidemiologist who is leading a government-appointed group working to control the outbreak, said on Tuesday that the numbers of new cases were falling in some provinces. He forecast that the epidemic could peak this month.\n“I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April,” he told Reuters. Zhong previously forecast an earlier peak that turned out to be incorrect.\nAs of midnight on Tuesday, China’s health commission said there were 2,015 new cases across the country, compared with 2,478 on Monday – a fall of 18.6%. The number of cases in China is now 44,653.\nThe death rate also fell across the country for the second time since the outbreak began. The number of new deaths reported as of midnight on Tuesday in China was 97. That compares with 108 reported for Monday – a fall of 10.2%. Of the new deaths, 94 were in Hubei province.\nExperts remain alarmed by the spread of the virus, which has now killed more than 1,100 people, all but two in mainland China.\nAsked about Zhong’s prediction, Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said: “I think it’s far too premature to say that. I think we’ve just got to watch the data very closely over the coming weeks before we make any predictions.”\nThe World Health Organization has described the virus as a global threat potentially worse than terrorism. The world must “wake up and consider this enemy virus as public enemy number one,” the WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Tuesday, adding that the first vaccine was 18 months away.\nAuthorities have named the pathogen Covid-19 – CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for the year it emerged. Ghebreyesus said the goal of the name was to avoid stigma. For weeks some have called the outbreak the “China virus” or “Wu flu”, for Wuhan where the virus was first detected.\nPublic health experts caution that there are still many unknowns, including its lethality, mode of transmission, what groups are most vulnerable to the virus and the success of prevention and quarantine measures so far.\n“Have these massive public health interventions, social distancing and mobility restrictions worked in China?” asked Gabriel Leung, chair of public health medicine at Hong Kong University and a leading coronavirus expert. “If so, how can we roll them out, or is it not possible?” He added: “We don’t know why it’s so contagious, so that’s a big problem.”\nThe incubation period, estimated to be between five and six days or up to 14 days, still requires more research. According to findings published on Sunday by Zhong and his team, the median incubation period is three days. One patient reported a 24-day incubation period.\nPublic health officials say it is still too early to predict when or if the outbreak will reach its peak in China. Next week, when more than 100 million citizens travel to return to work after the lunar new year holiday, will be critical for assessing whether the worst of the outbreak is over.\nExperts fear the virus will continue to spread outside of China. Hundreds of cases have been reported around the world, including one fatality in Hong Kong and another one in the Philippines.\nThe biggest cluster of cases outside of China is onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off the Japanese port of Yokohama. Japanese officials on Wednesday said another 39 people had tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the total to 174. A quarantine officer who boarded the ship to collect forms also tested positive.\nNon-essential staff of the US consulate in Hong Kong have been authorised to leave the city on a voluntary basis, according to the US state department, which has announced similar measures for staff in mainland Chinese cities.\nIn Singapore, where 47 people tested positive to the virus, the bank DBS cleared a downtown office after one of its staff was confirmed to have contracted the virus. The bank said it had asked about 300 employees to work from home and it was trying to trace all possible contacts the infected employee may have had.\n“It has spread to other places where it’s the beginning of the outbreak,”said Dale Fisher, head of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the WHO. “In Singapore we are at the beginning of the outbreak.”\nChinese authorities, nervous about the outbreak’s impact on the economy, have been pushing businesses and factories to reopen. The country’s education ministry cautioned university students graduating this year to be prepared for a “more complex and grim employment situation”.\nPeople in Hubei province are meant to return to work on 14 February as the extended lunar new year holiday comes to an end.\n“Wuhan has just passed the first 14 days [of quarantine]. Restarting work now would be the equivalent of repeating earlier disastrous mistakes. From the perspective of preventing and controlling the epidemic, this is not possible,” said Wang, 26, a teacher in the city.\nTuan Tuan, 31, who works in a bank in Wuhan, said: “We are all waiting to see if they extend the date. Nobody wants to [go back to work]. If we don’t hear in these two days of a postponement then we all have to go back.”\nBy mid-January at least 500 medical workers in Wuhan had contracted the virus, according to the South China Morning Post, citing medical sources.\nChina’s state news agency Xinhua said in an article on Tuesday that the epidemic was a “battle that has no gunpowder smoke but must be won”. It said the epidemic was a “big test of China’s governance system and capabilities” and some officials were still “dropping the ball” in places where it was most severe. “This is a wake-up call for us,” it said.\nMeanwhile a Japanese official who visited the cruise ship held in quarantine off Yokohama, Japan, has tested positive for the virus, according to the New York Times."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/b4a25018be9466693d04980c1bb3f2ce", "title": "China forfeits Davis Cup tie in Romania due to virus", "text": "China forfeits Davis Cup tie in Romania due to virus\nLONDON (AP) — China forfeited a Davis Cup tie on Tuesday because its men’s tennis team cannot travel to Romania next month.\nThe International Tennis Federation cited “increased restrictions in response to the current coronavirus outbreak” for the decision.\nChina was to play in Piatra Neamt, Romania, on March 6-7 in a World Group I playoff.\nThe ITF said Romania will advance to a World Group I tie in September.

But it is the ratio of working-age people to dependents that is important, and that ratio is not increasing. At low levels of development the ratio boosts economic growth, given the contribution that a growing labour pool makes to national productivity. The ratio reduces in importance once countries become middle- and high-income economies.\nBecause of its extraordinarily young population, Africa will get to its demographic dividend—1.7 working-age people to every dependent—only at mid-century. Until then Africa’s very large number of children actually serves as a drag on development. The large demand for education means that governments have to focus on building more schools and associated infrastructure. As a result, there is little ability to improve the quality or quantity of teaching provided to those already in the system. In fact, the gap in schooling between Africa and the rest of the world has not narrowed but is as concerning now as it was 30 or 50 years ago.\nAdvancing Africa’s demographic dividend is key.

What is the point of could have, would have, should have? It doesn’t matter. We are doing it now. More than 90% of those who are infected fully recover and they are the source of a cure or vaccine.

A few years before his death, Sir Edmund Hillary urged the Nepalese government to close Everest to climbing for a number of years, but he was ignored. Any death on the mountain that is caused by overcrowding rather than by the natural hazards of this formidable challenge is unacceptable. The waste being deposited, including dangerous drugs, is deplorable. Some splendid clean-up work is being carried out by joint teams of Nepalese and overseas climbers. Most encouraging is the Mount Everest Biogas Project, spearheaded by Dan Mazur and Garry Porter.

In the 16th century, after the Calvinist revolt and the separation of the Netherlands, our histories diverged and the south experienced a vigorous counter-reform under the Spanish monarchy.\nAs a result, swearing in Dutch-speaking Belgium relates to the Catholic religion: loop naar de duivel (go to the devil), Godverdomme (Goddamn), and so on. But of late, youngsters in both countries use the same American street English they pick up from television, cinema, festivals, etc. So that after so many centuries they are once again united, at least in swearing.\nANDRÉ MONTEYNE\nFormer liberal MP\nBrussels\nIronically, that English four-letter word starting with an f may well have originated from the Dutch fok, meaning to breed.

It has become clear in the past week that the new viral disease, covid-19, which struck China at the start of December will spread around the world. Many governments have been signalling that they will stop the disease. Instead, they need to start preparing people for the onslaught (see article).\nOfficials will have to act when they do not have all the facts, because much about the virus is unknown. A broad guess is that 25-70% of the population of any infected country may catch the disease. China’s experience suggests that, of the cases that are detected, roughly 80% will be mild, 15% will need treatment in hospital and 5% will require intensive care. Experts say that the virus may be five to ten times as lethal as seasonal flu, which, with a fatality rate of 0.1%, kills 60,000 Americans in a bad year. Across the world, the death toll could be in the millions.\nIf the pandemic is like a very severe flu, models point to global economic growth being two percentage points lower over 12 months, at around 1%; if it is worse still, the world economy could shrink. As that prospect sank in during the week, the S&P 500 fell by 8% (see article).\nYet all those outcomes depend greatly on what governments choose to do, as China shows. Hubei province, the origin of the epidemic, has a population of 59m. It has seen more than 65,000 cases and a fatality rate of 2.9%. By contrast, the rest of China, which contains 1.3bn people, has suffered fewer than 13,000 cases with a fatality rate of just 0.4%. Chinese officials at first suppressed news of the disease, a grave error that allowed the virus to take hold. But even before it had spread much outside Hubei, they imposed the largest and most draconian quarantine in history. Factories shut, public transport stopped and people were ordered indoors. This raised awareness and changed behaviour. Without it, China would by now have registered many millions of cases and tens of thousands of deaths.\nThe World Health Organisation was this week full of praise for China’s approach. That does not, however, mean it is a model for the rest of the world. All quarantines carry a cost—not just in lost output, but also in the suffering of those locked away, some of whom forgo medical treatment for other conditions. It is still too soon to tell whether this price was worth the gains. As China seeks to revive its economy by relaxing the quarantine, it could well be hit by a second wave of infections. Given that uncertainty, few democracies would be willing to trample over individuals to the extent China has. And, as the chaotic epidemic in Iran shows, not all authoritarian governments are capable of it.\nYet even if many countries could not, or should not, exactly copy China, its experience holds three important lessons—to talk to the public, to slow the transmission of the disease and to prepare health systems for a spike in demand.\nA good example of communication is America’s Centres for Disease Control, which issued a clear, unambiguous warning on February 25th. A bad one is Iran’s deputy health minister, who succumbed to the virus during a press conference designed to show that the government is on top of the epidemic.\nEven well-meaning attempts to sugarcoat the truth are self-defeating, because they spread mistrust, rumours and, ultimately, fear. The signal that the disease must be stopped at any cost, or that it is too terrifying to talk about, frustrates efforts to prepare for the virus’s inevitable arrival. As governments dither, conspiracy theories coming out of Russia are already sowing doubt, perhaps to hinder and discredit the response of democracies.\nThe best time to inform people about the disease is before the epidemic. One message is that fatality is correlated with age. If you are over 80 or you have an underlying condition you are at high risk; if you are under 50 you are not. Now is the moment to persuade the future 80% of mild cases to stay at home and not rush to a hospital. People need to learn to wash their hands often and to avoid touching their face. Businesses need continuity plans, to let staff work from home and to ensure a stand-in can replace a vital employee who is ill or caring for a child or parent. The model is Singapore, which learned from SARS, another coronavirus, that clear, early communication limits panic.\nChina’s second lesson is that governments can slow the spread of the disease. Flattening the spike of the epidemic means that health systems are less overwhelmed, which saves lives. If, like flu, the virus turns out to be seasonal, some cases could be delayed until next winter, by which time doctors will understand better how to cope with it. By then, new vaccines and antiviral drugs may be available.\nWhen countries have few cases, they can follow each one, tracing contacts and isolating them. But when the disease is spreading in the community, that becomes futile. Governments need to prepare for the moment when they will switch to social distancing, which may include cancelling public events, closing schools, staggering work hours and so on. Given the uncertainties, governments will have to choose how draconian they want to be. They should be guided by science. International travel bans look decisive, but they offer little protection because people find ways to move. They also signal that the problem is “them” infecting “us”, rather than limiting infections among “us”. Likewise, if the disease has spread widely, as in Italy and South Korea, “Wuhan-lite” quarantines of whole towns offer scant protection at a high cost.\nScrub up\nThe third lesson is to prepare health systems for what is to come. That entails painstaking logistical planning. Hospitals need supplies of gowns, masks, gloves, oxygen and drugs. They should already be conserving them. They will run short of equipment, including ventilators. They need a scheme for how to set aside wards and floors for covid-19 patients, for how to cope if staff fall ill, and for how to choose between patients if they are overwhelmed. By now, this work should have been done.\nThis virus has already exposed the strengths and weaknesses of China’s authoritarianism. It will test all the political systems with which it comes into contact, in both rich and developing countries. China has bought governments time to prepare for a pandemic. They should use it. ■\nRead more:\nCovid-19 is now in 50 countries, and things will get worse (February 27th)\nTo curb covid-19, China is using its high-tech surveillance tools (February 27th)\nCovid-19 presents economic policymakers with a new sort of threat (February 20th)\nHow China’s coronavirus epidemic could hurt the world economy (February 13th)\nThis article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline \"Going global\""}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/uss-port-18-sailors-test-positive-coronavirus-c8f66d0e-066c-4432-95c0-4df1de05e52f.html", "title": "USS Kidd reports jump in coronavirus cases", "text": "USS Kidd reports jump in coronavirus cases\nThe guided missile destroyer USS Kidd.

Some respondents said that in cases where supplies of protective gear were insufficient, employers called on nurses to improvise by using raincoats instead of protective gowns.\n\"A message came from the head doctor: We are trying to ensure we have sufficient PPE in service housing units. However [you should] prepare to improvise. You can quickly make masks to protect the mouth and nose from paper towels, staples and rubber bands,\" one nurse recounted in the survey.\n\"Today we received new guidelines according to which caregivers working in the facility could 'briefly' go into rooms with patients who have tested positive and those suspected of having coronavirus without any protective gear. That doesn't really make any sense,\" another wrote.\n\"We are already running low on protective clothing and hand sanitiser at this stage of the epidemic.

There seems to be a particular absence of guidance there and a shortage of PPE,\" association chair Nina Hahtela said.\nNurses have also spoken out about conflicting guidelines and while many fear for their own health, they are also concerned about patient safety.\n\"We have been told that we should not begin to revive coronavirus patients without proper protection, the kind that in practice, is not available in hospitals. This simply means that if there is no protection, there is no resuscitation.

HUS also said that it had not advised nursing staff to use paper towels to make masks.\nAccording to Sand, the Pirkanmaa district is already seeing a shortage of surgical masks.\n\"Perhaps in relation to the ideal situation where disposable surgical masks would be used in all healthcare contacts - without Covid-19 - there is a shortage of protective equipment. And we have not been able to recommend the use of protective masks these situations, at least not so far,\" he noted.\nThe medical chief of staff said however that over the past two weeks the situation has improved with regard to protective gear. He added that it seems that it will continue to improve with the arrival of imported products as well as due to locally-produced items.\nHospital doctors best-equipped\nThe doctors' survey found that 30 percent of more than 8,500 respondents said that there were occasional shortages of safety gear in their units, while six percent reported equipment shortages as ongoing.\nThe FMA survey suggested that physicians working at hospitals were the best-equipped when it came to protective outfits, with 60 percent working in such institutions saying that they had enough PPE at the time of the survey. One in four professionals said however that they had not been given sufficient guidance on how to avoid the risk of personal infection with the virus in the workplace.\nThe FMA also asked doctors experiencing respiratory symptoms whether or not they had been able to get tested for Covid-19. The survey revealed that 83 percent of physicians with symptoms who had been working with coronavirus patients had been tested. However just over 65 percent of doctors working with other patients and who experienced the same symptoms said they had been tested."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/us/coronavirus-texas-austin-spring-break-cabo.html", "title": "28 Texas Students Have Coronavirus After Spring Break Trip", "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — Two weeks ago, amid the coronavirus pandemic, about 70 students from the University of Texas at Austin partied in Mexico on spring break. The students, all in their 20s, flew on a chartered plane to Cabo San Lucas, and some returned on separate commercial flights to Texas.\nNow, 44 of them have tested positive for the virus and are self-isolating. More students were monitored and tested on Wednesday, university officials said, after 28 initial positive tests.\nThe Austin outbreak is the latest to result from a group of college students who ignored social-distancing guidelines, went on traditional spring break trips and have now tested positive for the coronavirus. Many of them appeared to be under the mistaken impression that young people are not as likely to get the coronavirus as older people are. Students at the University of Tampa, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and other colleges have tested positive after returning from spring break trips to Florida, Alabama, Tennessee and elsewhere.\nThe defiant attitude, at a time when millions of Americans were hunkered down at home and staying away from school, work and relatives, was embodied by Brady Sluder, a young man on spring break in Miami who declared from a packed beach: “If I get corona, I get corona. At the end of the day, I’m not going to let it stop me from partying.” Mr. Sluder, whose television interview was shared widely, later apologized on Instagram.\nIn Austin, health officials with the city government and the university have contacted every young person who was on the chartered plane, using flight manifests shared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the authorities said. City health officials used the case to urge residents of all ages to stay home and to avoid nonessential travel. At least four of the 44 students who tested positive had not shown any symptoms of the coronavirus.\n“The virus often hides in the healthy and is given to those who are at grave risk of being hospitalized or dying,” Dr. Mark E. Escott, the interim medical director and health authority for the city of Austin and Travis County, said in a statement. “While younger people have less risk for complications, they are not immune from severe illness and death from Covid-19,” the disease caused by the coronavirus.\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S.\n- A deep recession and ballooning unemployment in Europe darken the global economic picture.\n- President Trump pushes to reopen the economy as new reports illustrate fragmented federal response.\n- Comparing recent deaths to historical figures hints at the real toll in each U.S. state.\nU.T. Austin canceled classes on March 13 and resumed instruction online on Monday.\n“The incident is a very strong reminder of the importance of taking seriously the warnings of public health authorities on the risks of Covid-19,” said J.B. Bird, director of media relations at the university.\nThe state’s flagship university has been hit hard by the virus. Its president, Gregory L. Fenves, announced last month that his wife had tested positive, and that his family was self-isolating. Mr. Fenves’s wife, Carmel, began exhibiting flulike symptoms after the couple traveled to New York City for events with alumni and students. Mr. Fenves’s tests later came back negative.\nThe group of roughly 70 students departed from the Austin airport on March 14 and many of them returned on March 19. The trip was organized by a company called JusCollege, which bills itself as a “one-stop shop” for spring break and college-oriented trips.\n“I’m not going to judge those students’ decision,” said Camron I. Goodman, 24, the university’s student government president. “A lot of students had to make some tough decisions about their spring break plans.”\nOn Wednesday, JusCollege’s website still included an event listing for “Cabo Spring Break 2020” from Feb. 23 to April 10. “Join us as we take over Cabo San Lucas for Spring Break 2020!” the listing reads. “Place your deposit to lock in best pricing.”\nThe Austin television station KVUE posted emails that the company sent to students in the days before the trip, assuring them that spring break was still on and was still safe.\nOne of the emails, sent by the company on March 3, read, “We believe that our travel destinations remain among the safest and most enjoyable places in the world to visit right now.” In another, sent on March 12, the company wrote that “we’re currently in our 2nd week of Cabo and have had almost 5,000 travelers, all with no issues.”\nA statement later posted on JusCollege’s website told travelers that the remaining spring break trips were being postponed until a later date in 2020. “We are committed to building solutions that connect people and provide safety and security for our community while sustaining our love of adventure,” the company’s statement read.\nDavid Montgomery reported from Austin, and Manny Fernandez from Houston."}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/03/12/how-deadly-is-the-new-coronavirus", "title": "Daily chart - How deadly is the new coronavirus ? | Graphic detail", "text": "AS THE NUMBER of deaths among people infected by the new coronavirus mounts, it is tempting to divide that figure by the number of reported cases and conclude that the result is the fatality rate. Apply such maths to the world’s total of confirmed cases and deaths on March 11th and you get a fatality rate of 3.6%. But this figure, which epidemiologists call the “naive” case fatality rate, may be wrong in two different ways. First, many of the infections detected at this early stage of the epidemic are recent, so some will eventually result in deaths. That will push the fatality rate up. Second, many infections have not been spotted because testing for the virus has been patchy. Lots of mild cases of the disease have gone unnoticed. If all infections were actually counted, the result would be a bigger denominator. That would push the fatality rate down. As China began to trace infections more carefully, its fatality rate fell (see left-hand chart).\nA conclusive measure of the denominator requires testing for antibodies against the virus in a large sample of people in a place which an outbreak has already swept through. Such studies are under way in China. In the meantime, researchers have estimated the fatality rate for covid-19 using a cohort of people for whom there is a full count of infections and deaths: passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. A bungled quarantine on board led to nearly 700 cases of covid-19. Eight people have died so far. A working paper published on March 5th by Timothy Russell of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and an international team of researchers estimates that the fatality rate among infected passengers will end up being 1.2%.\nThe researchers applied the results from the ship to data on covid-19 cases and deaths in China. They conclude that the fatality rate for covid-19 in the country’s outbreak was 0.5%. For comparison, that is five times the fatality rate for the seasonal flu in America.\nThe covid-19 fatality rate among those on the Diamond Princess was higher partly because their average age was 58, older than the general population in any country. At the same time, they are probably in fairly good shape. They must be healthy enough to embark on an extended holiday. People who go on cruises tend to be richer. So the fatality rate among these passengers may be lower than it would be among people of a similar age in their home countries.\nA recent study by researchers at the University of Bern, in Switzerland, sheds more light. It provides estimates of covid-19 fatality by age group in Hubei, the province in China with the worst outbreak of the disease. Fatality is dramatically higher among people older than 60, rising to 18% among those in their 80s or older (see right-hand chart).\nBut covid-19 may prove no less devastating for poor countries, which tend to have younger populations. The disease is more severe in people whose immune systems are weakened by chronic diseases, so those who are malnourished or have HIV/AIDS will probably be hit hard.\nThe fatality rate in any country will depend primarily on the quality of care it can provide—and how many people have access to it. About 5% of people diagnosed with covid-19 in China have needed intensive care, which is in short supply or non-existent in most hospitals in developing countries. A surge in cases even in rich countries can soon overwhelm hospitals and result in higher fatality rates."}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/12/covid-19-is-spreading-rapidly-in-america-the-country-does-not-look-ready", "title": "Uncle Sam v the coronavirus - Covid - 19 is spreading rapidly in America . The country does not look ready | United States", "text": "WHEN A NEW disease first took hold in Wuhan, the Chinese authorities did not have the luxury of advanced notice. Their initial strategy, in the crucial early weeks of what would become the global pandemic covid-19, was obfuscation and censorship, which did nothing to halt the spread of the virus that causes the disease. Only now, months after the first cases were reported, have new transmissions slowed to close to zero—and only after an unprecedented, draconian lockdown for hundreds of millions of citizens.\nAmerica, by contrast, had the luxury of several weeks’ notice. Yet the crucial early weeks when it could have prepared for the spread of the disease were squandered, in a country with some of the world’s best epidemiologists and physicians. As of March 11th, almost 1,300 Americans had been diagnosed with covid-19. Several times more probably have the disease undetected and are transmitting it within communities. And still the country looks behind in its preparations for what now threatens to be a bruising pandemic. (For more coverage of covid-19 see our coronavirus hub.)\nAmerica’s decentralised authority, expensive health care and skimpy safety-net will all make the pandemic response harder to deal with. The uncertainty is high, but a plausible scenario—one-fifth of the population falling ill, and a 0.5% fatality rate—would lead to 327,000 deaths, or nine times that of a typical flu season.\nHow America got here was the result of two significant failures—one technical, the other of messaging. A country of America’s size could probably not have avoided a serious outbreak of covid-19. But with enough information, the early spread of the disease could have been slowed. That lowers the peak of the outbreak, lightening the load on hospitals when they are most overstretched, thereby saving lives. It also gives the health service and the government time to prepare, and the population a chance to learn how to respond.\nHowever, in America the testing regime has worked badly, because of faulty test-kits manufactured by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and tangles in administrative red tape between the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), another government agency. “The debacle with the tests probably reflects underlying budget cuts. You can’t have surge capacity if you’ve already been cut to the bone,” says Scott Burris, director of the Centre of Public Health Law Research at Temple University. In 2010 the CDC budget was $12.7bn in current dollars; today it is $8bn. Whether skimpy budgeting, bureaucratic blockages or both were to blame is as yet unclear and sure to be the subject of a future investigation.\nWhen there are just a few infections, the health system has enough epidemiologists to track down and quarantine patients and their recent contacts. Without surveillance, however, small clusters rapidly become full-blown epidemics. This is where America finds itself today. The estimated doubling time of the virus is six days. If that remains constant, as is likely, the close-to-1,300 current cases are the bottom of a sickening ride up an exponential curve of infections. “In literal terms, we have no idea about the number of cases because nobody has tested to any meaningful extent,” says Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard. “Tens of thousands of cases in the US seems plausible,” he adds.\nA successful testing regime also buys time for the right messaging. But from the start, President Donald Trump has downplayed the chance of big disruption to ordinary lives and the economy. His insistence that virus hysteria was being amped up by his political enemies has distracted from the crucial message, which is to get ready. His announcement on March 11th of a ban on most travel from Europe was confused (he initially appeared to suggest it would apply to cargo), arbitrary (it excludes Britain) and accomplishes little now that the virus is spreading from within.\nThese mistakes cannot be undone. But what matters now is giving people the right information and reinforcing hospitals ahead of the inevitable deluge of cases. Unfortunately, the difficulties in testing and honest messaging look set to persist.\nEven after the error in the test kits was detected, the increase in testing has been slow. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, and Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, have been begging the FDA to speed up approval for automated testing, to boost capacity from around 100 tests a day to the several thousand that are needed. A doctor at a Chicago clinic says that she has received no kits, nor guidance on when they will come. When she sees patients with covid-19-like symptoms she has to send them to be tested at a nearby hospital.\nNow that kits are being delivered, researchers are reporting another problem—a shortage of the components needed to extract genetic material from samples. The White House promised capacity of 1m tests by March 6th. The CDC has stopped publishing data on the number of tests performed. But the latest cobbled-together estimates, as of March 11th, are of 7,000 tests in total, well behind almost every developed country with an outbreak.\nMr Trump has minimised the threat all the same. On March 9th he blamed the “Fake News Media” and Democrats for conspiring “to inflame the Coronavirus situation” and wrongly suggested that the common flu was more dangerous. The same day, Nancy Messonnier, an official at the CDC, was warning, correctly, that “as the trajectory of the outbreak continues, many people in the United States will at some point in time this year or next be exposed to this virus.”\nCorrecting the course of the outbreak is vital because America’s health infrastructure, like that of most countries, is not equipped to deal with an enormous surge in serious cases. A recent study of covid-19 in China found that 5% of patients needed to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), with many needing intensive ventilation or use of a more sophisticated machine that oxygenates blood externally. America has 95,000 ICU beds and 62,000 mechanical ventilators, while only 290 hospitals out of 6,000 offer the most intensive treatment. Much of this equipment is already being used for current patients, including those with seasonal flu. Human capacity, such as the number of pulmonologists and specially trained nurses, is also a limiting factor—although in Italy, where the epidemic is raging, specialisms have begun to matter less. Mortality in overwhelmed hospitals will certainly be higher.\nTo reduce the chances of this happening, rates of transmission must be slowed by encouraging social distancing and telework, and cancelling large gatherings. (Sports events are already being called off: the National Basketball Association season was suspended on March 11th.) But in America authority over public health is largely delegated to the states and some cities. It is for each locality to declare a state of emergency; 13 had done so as of March 11th. The decentralised system means that containment regimes will differ.\nMr Cuomo has ordered a series of measures: a one-mile containment area in New Rochelle, site of a cluster, serviced by the National Guard; and a state-produced line of hand-sanitiser made by prisoners to ameliorate a shortage. At the same time, New York City and Chicago have so far resisted closing their public schools, noting that many poor households rely on them for meals and child care. Many private universities are cancelling classes and switching to tele-instruction (causing much difficulty for some septuagenarian professors). Harvard gave its undergraduates five days’ notice to pack their things and leave.\nMaintaining a healthy population requires people not to spread the disease, but also to seek treatment without worrying about crippling debt. America is one of the few countries in the developed world that does not mandate paid sick leave. A mere 20% of low-paid, service-sector workers can count on it. Those without cannot stay at home, because a retail worker cannot just fire up Slack and Zoom as a white-collar office worker might.\nHealth care is also extraordinarily costly. People who are uninsured, underinsured (ie, liable for a high share of their treatment costs) or fearful of surcharges for using out-of-network hospitals and physicians may keep away—particularly if their pay has recently fallen or stopped altogether. “The idea that people should have skin in the game kind of doesn’t work when you’re also playing with your neighbour’s skin,” says Wendy Parmet, a professor of public-health law at Northeastern University. Some insurers, as in Illinois or in California, insist that patients will not be made to pay for testing. But as yet there is no such policy at national level.\nLast week Congress passed an emergency appropriation of $8.3bn to fight the virus, which Mr Trump signed into law. Almost all that money will be devoted to front-line measures—such as test-kits, laboratory equipment and additional staff. A bigger fiscal stimulus will probably be needed. Mr Trump and Democratic leaders have sketched competing visions for what to do. The president would like to provide tax credits directly to stricken industries such as airlines, frackers and cruise-ship operators, cut payroll taxes (usually paid every two weeks) and offer paid sick leave to hourly workers. Democrats have proposed more generous paid-sick-leave rules, expanded payments for programmes like unemployment insurance and nutrition assistance, and guaranteed payment of all testing and out-of-pocket treatment costs. The need is urgent, but the haggling could drag on for some time.\nThus far in his presidency, Mr Trump has faced a few crises. Most he generated himself, including various trade wars and bouts of chest-thumping, which could generally be defused. The virus, however, will circulate no matter how much the president may wish it gone. Talking down the risks is not a winning strategy. To fight the outbreak, America needs clear, unvarnished public information and policies based on the best science. Is the president capable of endorsing that? ■\nDig deeper:\n- For more coverage of covid-19 see our coronavirus hub\n- The science of the virus\n- Fatality rates for covid-19 could vary enormously\n- How to deal with a new sort of financial shock\n- Should other countries copy Italy’s nationwide lockdown?\nThis article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline \"Dropping the ball\""}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/ireland/two-irish-tourists-test-positive-for-coronavirus-on-cruise-ship-k5cr3x0fw", "title": "Two Irish tourists test positive for coronavirus on cruise ship", "text": "Two Irish tourists test positive for coronavirus on cruise ship\nHealth officials have told people to ring their doctor if they think they have coronavirus.

Easily programmable industrial robots could make it simpler to produce what we use here in the U.S., reducing that vulnerability.\nEven before the novel coronavirus reached the U.S., the supply chain disruptions caused by the virus' spread in China were damaging the American economy.\n- On Feb. 17, when there were just 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., Apple issued an earnings warning because of the impact of the virus on its Chinese suppliers.\n- China made half the world's respiratory masks before COVID-19 hit and restricted exports once the pandemic was in full force, leaving other countries, including the U.S., with dwindling supplies.\nContext: Obviously, the U.S. needs stronger domestic manufacturing capability, especially right now. But it's not just that American companies have grown dependent on international supply chains.\n- As of last fall, U.S. manufacturers reported more than 500,000 unfilled jobs, due in large part to a gap between the skills companies needed and the skills workers had.\nIf workers aren't available, one option might be robots.\n- Ready Robotics, a startup spun out of Johns Hopkins University, provides simple software to power industrial robots. The software allows workers with little to no experience in robotics to program industrial robots for manufacturing work.\n- With robots that are more easily customizable, manufacturers can employ them for short and custom runs, mixing up what they can produce. \"If you do it today, it takes 4 to 8 weeks of setup time,\" says Ben Gibbs, Ready Robotics CEO. \"With our software, it's 4 to 8 hours for a run.\"\nThese changes were already underway before the pandemic, but COVID-19 may accelerate them.\n- \"The future of supply chain infrastructure will be focused on improving resiliency through onshoring and automation,\" says Rayfe Gaspar-Asaoka, a venture capitalist at Canaan. \"It's the Zoom + Slack of manufacturing.\"\nThe bottom line: The first response in a pandemic is to stick close to home.

", "text": "Coronavirus: the movie is somehow already here – but are we ready for it?\nCorona, the first full-length feature about the pandemic, is a one-shot thriller set in an elevator, an impressively speedy, if dubious, feat\nIn these times of self-isolation, it’s easy to sit back and plot the type of coronavirus movie you’d like to make. Maybe it’s one about an embattled team of scientists and their desperate search for a vaccine. Maybe it’s one about an estranged father who has to fight his way through police lines in order to give his son a birthday present. Maybe – because not everything can be a gritty drama – it’s a hilarious comedy about a man whose trousers fall down whenever he coughs.\nEither way, the ideas you have right now are just that: ideas. If you had any real gumption, you’d have followed the footsteps of the Canadian director Mostafa Keshvari and already written and shot an entire coronavirus feature film.\nBecause, incredibly, Keshvari appears to have done just that. Entitled Corona, the film takes place entirely within the confines of an elevator. Neighbours of different backgrounds enter – a Chinese lady, a pregnant woman, a wheelchair-bound Nazi with a swastika tattoo on his forehead – and panic begins to spread just as quickly as the disease. Or, as the movie’s tagline puts it, “Fear is a Virus”.\nA trailer for the film has already been released. Not to give too much away but – if I’m reading this right – the Chinese woman starts coughing, which causes the elevator to stall. The lights go out. The emergency lights kick in, and for some reason they’re red flashing submarine-style lights. Someone screams: “We’re all going to die in here!” The Nazi pulls out a gun. The Chinese woman starts crying. And then a man says: “I think we’re all being tested,” which leads me to believe that Corona will posit that the spread of Covid-19 is down to an evil Saw-style puppet who created the virus in a lab as an unnecessarily complicated no-win morality test for humanity.\nI could be wrong, and I won’t know until Corona hits the streaming services soon. But still, you can’t knock the director’s ambition. Keshvari had written the film, shot it and cut the trailer by 8 March, days before overt public jumpiness and weeks before the lockdown. You may have seen the spectre of the virus as a threat to your friends and family, but not Keshvari. He saw it as an opportunity to make a name for himself.\nHe’s by no means a beginner – his short film I Ran was selected in the 2015 Cannes Short Corner Film Festival – but by almost definitely making the world’s first coronavirus feature film, Keshvari’s stock is bound to rise. Not an awful lot is known about him but, judging by his IMDb page, he used to be a banker, he gained a scholarship at Vancouver Film School, he’s making a thriller about women’s rights, he’s a published poet and his personal quotes include: “Your life is a movie, direct it before someone else will” and “Point the camera where the light is and pull focus on your dreams.” Hopefully he has a long movie career ahead of him. But, if he doesn’t, you get the feeling that he’d do quite well in the inspirational vinyl wall decal business.\nWhat’s even more impressive about Corona is that Keshvari was able to add a level of en vogue artistry to the film, by recording the whole thing in a single shot. It should be seen as a distant cousin to 1917, perhaps.\nWhen all this blows over and we’re hit with a deluge of Contagion-style films about the virus – some by established auteurs, some by plucky up-and-comers – we should make sure that we don’t forget about Corona. We shouldn’t have to watch it, because God knows time is precious, but we shouldn’t forget about it."}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-study-air-surfaces-cb5029b8-6ba8-42da-8d07-c96178403ef7.html", "title": "Coronavirus can last hours in air and days on some surfaces , study finds", "text": "Study: Coronavirus can last hours in air and days on some surfaces\nSpecialists in protective suits disinfect Beylerbeyi Palace in Istanbul, Turkey.

Calculations by the Health Board and the Ministry of Social Affairs indicate that expenses in the field will total some €3 million, exclusive of labor costs.\nSpeaking on Vikerraadio morning broadcast \"Vikerhommik\" on Monday, Kiik said that in terms of spread of the virus, the situation in Estonia is currently stable. The one case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed last week has thus far remained the only confirmed case.\nAs of Monday, some 60 additional people have been tested for the virus who had either themselves recently been in at-risk regions or whose loved ones had and who had exhibited symptoms of the disease, however all of these tests have turned up negative.\nBased on Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agency data, the Ministry of Social Affairs has also attempted to map out how many Estonian residents are currently or have recently been located in at-risk regions, and according to Kiik, this figure may reach into the thousands.\nThe social affairs minister is requesting people remember when asked by the Health Board to remain home for two weeks after returning from an at-risk region that their health and that of those around them are the most important thing. He noted that one doesn't necessarily have to be sick in order to receive a sick leave certificate from their doctor, but doctors must make an informed decision in each case regarding whether or not to issue one.\nThe Estonian government is convening on Monday to discuss proposals worked out by the working group formed by Kiik for the prevention of the spread of the novel coronavirus. Kiik's primary request of the government is that it in principle endorses these proposals, and that if it considers any additional measures necessary, that it provides proposals of its own accordingly.\n\"The matter of sources of funding will certainly come up — i.e. what will the actual additional cost be, as we know that preventing the virus will require additional human resources, thermal imaging cameras cost money, as will all kinds of protective gear, which is frequently purchased as backup and just in case, but you can't start ordering them once the virus has already spread too far, you have to buy them now already,\" the minister described.\n\"The Health Board and Ministry of Social Affairs have calculated that our field's expenses, which largely involve generating reserves in order to be prepared for a situation that may last weeks or months, is in the magnitude of €3 million,\" Kiik said. \"Regarding labor costs, however, this may increase significantly depending on how many people in Estonia end up infected.\"\nIf you suspect coronavirus disease\nAccording to the risk assessment of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), current regions considered at risk of novel coronavirus include China, Iran, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and the Northern Italian regions of Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont.\nCoronavirus testing can be conducted on individuals who are already exhibiting symptoms of the disease; prior to the development of symptoms such as cough, fever and difficulty breathing, testing will likely provide a false negative result.\nIf you suspect you have fallen ill with coronavirus disease, call your family doctor or the family doctor hotline at 1220. If you are experiencing more serious symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, call emergency services at 112.\nDo not independently seek treatment at a hospital emergency room (ER), which could lead to the potential spread of the virus.\nOn Saturday, February 29, regular, three-member paramedic brigades were joined in Tallinn by a new, dedicated two-member brigade consisting of a healthcare professional and a tech tasked with responding to potential coronavirus cases.\nAccording to the latest info, COVID-19's symptoms are similar to those of the flu.

Both have - by their own will - contacted the health service in their region.\nMarta says that when they called her they informed her the system was saturated and they did not answer her question until the next day.\nShe said: \"When they treated me, they gave me no indication, all they told me was that if I had no symptoms, I didn't have to do anything.\"\nIn the case of her roommate, a Spaniard living with her in Milan who is presenting symptoms, the authorities did collect samples for testing.\nThey have not yet sent him the results.\nRaul, on the other hand, had doubts about contacting the health service.\nHe said: \"I wanted to call, but at the same time I thought: what a job if they now put me in quarantine.\n\"I thought there was a possibility that they would automatically put me in isolation, and not knowing what it was, I was afraid of being with people infected with coronavirus and becoming infected.\"\nThe student said health authorities should give more information so that people who return from an area declared \"at risk\" are not afraid to inform the health services about their situation.\nBut Spain's ministry of health has said that each region is responsible for its own protocol against the coronavirus.\nHealth competencies are assigned to the autonomous community, which is why the ministry is only responsible for giving guidelines and preventive measures.\nIn addition, the ministry does not have centralised information.\n\"We do not even know the number of possible infected cases that may exist in each community,\" it said."}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-spain-wants-eu-to-unite-behind-1-5-trillion-covid-19-recovery-fund", "title": "Coronavirus : Spain wants EU to unite behind €1 . 5 trillion COVID - 19 recovery fund", "text": "Spain is calling on its neighbours to unite behind its proposal for a joint EU fund that would help the bloc’s hardest-hit economies recover from the coronavirus crisis.\n\"In this crisis, either we all sink or we all float. Spain wants everybody to float, for sure,\" Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya told Euronews ahead of a key EU summit this week.\nSpain is suggesting creating an economic recovery fund with up to €1.5 trillion, according to an internal Spanish government document.\nThe document, seen by The Associated Press, says the fund should draw from members states' grants in order not to raise public debt levels.\nEarlier this month, Eurozone finance ministers agreed on a roughly €500 billion package to help member states tackle the immediate economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis. But they left the more tricky issue of funding the bloc’s recovery up to EU heads of state and government, who will meet by videoconference on Thursday.\nFrance is siding with southern states including Italy and Spain in calling for joint debt, or so-called \"corona bonds\", an idea so far rejected by several northern nations like the Netherlands and Germany.\n\"What we now need is the medium-to-long term response to this crisis, comprised of two pieces: a budget and a recovery fund,\" Gonzalez Laya said in an interview on Euronews Tonight.\nShe insisted that Spain is trying to build consensus with a \"responsible\", \"ambitious\", and \"pragmatic\" proposal.\n“We all know that all our economies will suffer as a result of COVID. We all know the response requires a collective investment on the side of the EU,\" she said.\n\"Let’s do this in an ambitious manner, in a responsible manner but also in a pragmatic manner. If we follow these three ingredients, we will get a solution sooner rather than later, because we need to restart the engines of our economy soon.\"\nLearning from the past\nA strong response by the EU would ensure the bloc is a strong player not only on the global economic stage but also in foreign and political affairs, Gonzalez Laya added.\nThe International Monetary Fund has warned that the coronavirus crisis would cause the biggest economic shock to the global economy since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nSpain, just like France, is now expecting its GDP to shrink like never before since World War II. The Spanish central bank has warned that, depending on the length of the nation's lockdown, the economy could contract by up to 12.4 per cent this year.\nIt's not just Spain or Europe, but the whole world that will need to pull together and make a huge effort to recover from this crisis, Gonzalez Laya said.\n\"It will require making sure that this time we do not leave anybody behind. And that we concentrate also on the human element, the workers' element, much more than we did back in 2008,\" she said, referring to the financial crisis that led to a decade of austerity for many Europeans.\n'We did our best'\nAfter the United States and Italy, Spain is one of the countries with the worst death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 21,000 fatalities and more than 200,000 confirmed infections.\nThe country has been since March 14 under a very strict lockdown that is set to be extended until May 9, though some of the restrictions are being eased.\nChildren under the age of 14, who were not permitted to leave their homes, will be allowed to go out starting next week, but only to accompany their parents on essential outings such as shopping for food or medicines.\nAsked how her government had fared in its response to the crisis, Gonzalez Laya said: \"We’ve handled it with the best knowledge that we could and with the best intentions that we had, and with a lot of humility.\"\nShe said it would be easier to judge what the government had done right or wrong with the benefit of hindsight, especially as knowledge about the disease evolves so fast.\n\"We now know much more about COVID-19 than what we knew when we started handling it. We’ve always followed scrupulously the recommendations we got from our health authorities in Europe, internationally and in Spain,\" she said.\nYou can watch excerpts of the interview by clicking on the player above."}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/socialdistance/", "title": "Social Distance", "text": "Daily phone calls about science, health, and how to keep things in perspective.\nSubscribe On:\n- Episode 40\n‘Things Can Change In an Instant’\nIn many ways, this crisis is unprecedented.

It is not clear when people will now be able to view the shrine due to tough restrictions on gatherings imposed to help combat the spread of the virus.\nBut experts are painstakingly cleaning the gold, bronze and ivory shrine, which has been hidden from public view for the last 25 years, in preparation for when it can go on display.\n“We have brought the shrine out a bit earlier than planned and now we expect more interest due to the virus,” said Aachen Cathedral spokeswoman Daniela Loevenich.\nCorona is believed to have been only about 16 years old when the Romans killed her, probably in Syria, for professing the Christian faith.\nThe girl suffered a particularly excruciating death, according to legend. She was tied to two bent palm trees and then torn apart as the trunks were released.\n“That is a very gruesome story and led to her becoming the patron of lumberjacks,” said Brigitte Falk, head of Aachen Cathedral Treasure Chamber, adding that it was pure chance that she also became a patron saint for resisting epidemics.\nCorona’s relics, brought to Aachen by King Otto III in 997, were kept in a tomb underneath a slab in the cathedral - which can still be seen - until 1911-12 when they were placed in the shrine, which is 93 centimetres tall and weighs 98 kilograms.\nThe Roman Catholic cathedral at Aachen, built by Emperor Charlemagne in the ninth century, is one of Europe’s oldest. Charlemagne was buried there in 814 and it was used for the coronation of German kings and queens.\nWhile the cathedral stresses that Corona is patron saint of resisting all epidemics, not just this specific virus, the virus is so called because under a microscope, it looks like a globe with little globules, resembling a crown, said Falk. In Latin corona means crown or garland.\n“Like many other saints, Saint Corona may be a source of hope in these difficult times,” said Falk.\nReporting by Reuters Television and Madeline Chambers; Editing by Gareth Jones"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/235a3cd9ca1e972c499dcfe77b198830", "title": "Poorer NYC neighborhoods hit hardest by virus", "text": "NYC residents should cover face when in public, mayor says\nALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — As coronavirus cases soared, New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio asked New Yorkers on Thursday to wear a face covering when they go outside to prevent the spread of the virus. Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned that the state’s supply of breathing machines could be exhausted in six days. And the COVID-19 death toll climbed to at least 2,400. While New York City remained a hotspot, there were troublesome trends around the state as the outbreak spread to every county. Unemployment filings skyrocketed too, as the pandemic wreaked economic havoc.\nThe latest developments in New York:\n___\nFACE COVERING\nNew York City Mayor Bill De Blasio asked New Yorkers to wear a face covering when they go outside and will be near other people.\nHe cited research showing asymptomatic people could be spreading the virus without realizing it.\n“When you put on that face covering, you’re protecting everyone else,” he said.\nThe mayor said it could be a scarf or a bandanna or anything homemade, but it should not be a surgical mask needed by medical workers.\nA recent study by researchers in Singapore became the latest to estimate that somewhere around 10% of new infections may be sparked by people who carry the virus but have not yet suffered symptoms.\nA bandanna might not prevent someone from coming into contact with the virus, but it could help a person who has it not give it to others when the sneeze, cough or breathe.\nThe mayor of Los Angeles also told everyone in the city to start wearing masks on Wednesday.\n____\nVENTILATORS RUNNING LOW\nCuomo warned New York could be six days away from exhausting its supply of ventilators as the state reported 432 deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to nearly 2,400.\nMore than 13,300 people were hospitalized statewide with about 3,400 in intensive care.\nVentilators have become the crucial piece of equipment sought by state and city officials as hundreds of patients a day are admitted to intensive care units.\nThe state sent 400 ventilators to New York City and another 200 to its suburbs. But the governor saw problems ahead.\n“At the current burn rate, we have about six days of ventilators in our stockpile,” the governor said at a briefing at the Capitol.\nIf supplies run short, the state is ready to use anesthesia and converted BiPAP machines, usually used to treat sleep apnea, or put more than one patient on a single ventilator.\nMore than 92,000 state residents have tested positive for the coronavirus. The true number is likely much higher because officials have rationed tests and encouraged all but the most seriously ill people not to seek treatment and instead ride it out at home.\nMost people who get the virus experience mild or moderate symptoms, including fever and cough. Others, though, develop pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization. The risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems.\n___\nUNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS\nMore than 464,000 people have filed for unemployment in New York state in the three weeks since the pandemic shattered the economy, an increase of over 1,000% from the same period last year, according to the state Department of Labor.\nLast week alone, more than 369,000 unemployment claims were filed, an increase of more than 2,600% from the same time last year.\nThe Department of Labor’s unemployment filing system has seen a 16,000% increase in phone calls and a nearly 900% increase in web traffic in recent weeks.\n___\nOUTBREAK SPREADS\nCases have now been confirmed in every county, with worrisome trends in some regions.\nCuomo said Thursday that there’s a “troubling rise” in suburban Long Island and Westchester County.\nAt the other end of the state, Buffalo and surrounding Erie County reporting 19 deaths and about 730 cases as of Thursday.\nAmong those infected in Buffalo is Common Council President Darius Pridgen, along with three of his adult children. His daughter was taken off a ventilator late Wednesday and began breathing on her own just before Pridgen went live on Facebook to offer an update from his own quarantine, frequently coughing and his voice hoarse.\n“It was pretty rough for a couple of days,” he said of his daughter.\nErie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said the Buffalo Niagara Convention Center could be used as an intensive-care hospital if needed during the projected peak in late April or early May.\n___\nTEACHER DIES\nSandra Santos-Vizcaino, who taught third grade at an elementary school in Brooklyn, is the first New York City school teacher reported to have died of COVID-19.\n“This is a devastating tragedy,” schools Chancellor Richard Carranza said Thursday. “Sandra was a beloved teacher at P.S. 9.”\nSantos-Vizcaino, 54, was a more than 20-year veteran of the city’s school system. She was recognized for her contributions to education in the Dominican Republic and won a grant to study bird sanctuaries there in 2009.\n“The notion that we’ve lost a teacher is very painful,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said. “We lost a principal last week, a young woman full of extraordinary promise.”\nBrooklyn principal Dez-Ann Romain was the first city education employee reported to have died of the virus.\nStudents in New York City haven’t been to school since March 13.\n___\nPRISON MASKS\nAdministrators of the state prison system said they will allow guards to wear masks on duty. Staff had been prohibited from wearing masks unless medically necessary.\nAlso, inmates subject to quarantine will be issued a surgical-type mask to further reduce the risk of any secondary transmission, officials said.\nThe state corrections department said Thursday that 176 employees and 24 inmates have had confirmed cases of COVID-19.\nThat includes Harvey Weinstein, the film producer serving 23 years for rape and sexual assault.\n___\nOTHER DEVELOPMENTS\nThe virus hasn’t spared any part of New York City, but new data shows that a few poorer neighborhoods in Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn are getting hit especially hard.\nCuomo’s press briefing included a live video appearance by his younger brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who has tested positive for coronavirus.\nNew York state is racing to roughly triple its hospital capacity as coronavirus cases surge.

Many people infected with or exposed to COVID-19 in these same areas were forcibly removed from the population and put into isolation centers for weeks. Public transportation was shut down.

", "text": "40,000 jobs in jeopardy: Will Estonian aviation disappear? ({{contentCtrl.commentsTotal}})\nThe Estonian aviation sector has never done so well as before the coronavirus outbreak. Back in February, one could still choose between 28 direct destinations flying out of Tallinn. Today, there are only three destinations left. The tourism sector has been hit first and hard. Next to suffer will be international trade. Estonia depends on foreign direct investments to a great degree and investors prefer direct connections. A state aid package is essential for survival. However, helping one or two companies is not enough. Support will be needed across the whole sector in order to -preserve the value chain, head of the Estonian Aviation Cluster Kristo Reinsalu writes.\nThe collapse of Virgin Australia after the briefest of struggles indicates the world's weakest airlines have little time to secure funds before they succumb to the coronavirus. \"In most countries, federal governments have stepped up, in what is an unprecedented crisis for aviation, to help their airlines. Sadly, that has not happened in Australia,\" wrote billionaire founder Richard Branson after he made a last-ditch appeal for government support for the country's second largest airline.\nThe International Air Transport Association that represents nearly 300 airlines has said that half face bankruptcy in two to three months without government help. Many carriers have furloughed staff and grounded entire fleets. IATA has warned that 25 million jobs in aviation and related sectors are at risk. According to IATA updated analysis, the COVID-19 crisis will see airline passenger revenues drop by $314 billion in 2020, a 55 percent decline compared to 2019.\nMany European airlines spent much of the past two decades asking governments to leave the airline industry. Now, many are begging for help. The Latvian state has pledged €150 million for AirBaltic to ensure air connectivity between Europe and Riga. Italy is close to taking full control of Alitalia, Norway and Portugal plan to do the same for Norwegian Air and TAP Portugal respectively. AirFrance/KLM is requesting aid from the Dutch and French governments. Even Europe´s largest airline, Lufthansa, was assured by the German government that it would not be left to its own devices. \"Financial relief for airlines today should be a critical policy measure for governments. Every airline job saved will keep 24 more people employed,\" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's director general and CEO.\nEstonian aviation was a rapidly growing sector of the economy\nThe Estonian aviation sector was seeing record-breaking growth in recent years. In 2019 alone, the number of passengers at Tallinn airport reached 3.27 million. In 2020, a growth of 5 percent was expected. The average value of one added employee in the aviation sector was estimated at €60 000, which is twice as high as the Estonian average. If we assume that every €1 in GDP contributes about 35 cents of tax revenue to the state budget, in 2019 alone, the Estonian aviation sector provided the state budget with more than €300 million in tax revenue.\nThe situation has changed dramatically today. Air traffic in Estonia has decreased by some 82 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. Overall, global air traffic is expected to decline by 48 percent this year. In April 2019, air traffic controllers from the Estonian Air Navigation Services (EANS) operated on average 668 flights every day, today the number is a mere 120.\nMembers of the Estonian Aviation Cluster provide around 2,000 high-paying jobs. Based on IATA's 1:24 ratio, the aviation sector has contributed to the creation of 40 000 jobs in the Estonian economy. According to some estimates, 150 different companies are providing services to Tallinn Airport alone. We should also be aware that there are jobs in many sectors of the national economy that will be lost without a functioning aviation industry, including tourism, trade, export-oriented manufacturing and services etc.\nIf the negative scenario is allowed to manifest and the state refuses to aid the Estonian aviation sector, a total of 500 jobs will be lost in 2020 alone. If this happens, Estonia will face the Lithuanian scenario – national carrier Fly LAL became insolvent and filed for bankruptcy in early 2009. Losing its national airline, Lithuania suffered serious damage to links between the capital city Vilnius and the rest of the world.\nAviation is a special sector\nWe have every right to support the aviation sector by all possible means, including through European Commission (EC) and national state aid today. The rules are different in aviation and it would not be illegal to provide larger amounts of state aid in the current situation for aviation companies. Thus, creation of a state aid package is critical for the development of the aviation sector and ensuring the country´s competitiveness:\n- Aid in the form of direct grants or equity. State-owned airline Nordica has asked an injection from the state to be prepared to operate flights out of Tallinn once the coronavirus crisis that has completely cut Estonia off from Europe ends.\n- Aid to restart air traffic at Tallinn airport. We have proposed offering airlines a discount of 75 percent on aviation and 30 percent on handling and infrastructure fees between June 2020 and March 2021.\n- Short-term export credit insurance to free the capital of distressed companies with a state guarantee. Even the world's largest airlines have extended the deadlines for paying bills.\n- Aid in the form of wage subsidies for employees to avoid layoffs during the COVID-19 outbreak. Laying off and then rehiring high-paid specialists involved in the Estonian aviation sector could prove to be time-consuming and very costly.\n- Aid in the form of deferrals of tax and/or of social security contributions to reduce the liquidity constraints of aviation companies and preserve employment.\nConclusion\nBefore the outbreak of the Corona-19 virus, the Estonian aviation sector was one of the fastest growing economic sectors in Estonia: high-paid jobs, considerable tax revenues for the State Treasury, twice the Estonian average value added per employee, export-intensive services. Today, however, we are in a new situation where the sector's future stakes no longer depend on our own actions. We strongly believe that it is not enough to support one or two companies because a lot of companies are intertwined and interdependent in the aviation value chain. Therefore, it is necessary to draw a more detailed and comprehensive plan for state aid measures as other countries are doing.\nDID YOU KNOW?\nThe average income of a graduate student at the Estonian Aviation Academy is the highest among all Estonian higher education institutions' graduates.\nThe largest-ever national airline Nordica is ready to re-establish airline connections shortly after the current coronavirus restrictions will be relaxed.\nMagnetic MRO has been Estonia's company of the year on several occasions and is a strong export-oriented service provider servicing almost 100 aircraft a year in its hangars.\nThe Estonian Aviation Cluster, established in 2019, unites 15 ambitious member-companies across the aviation value chain from airport to multiple airlines, maintenance, IT, logistics and transport.\n--\nDownload the ERR News app for Android and iOS now and never miss an update!\nEditor: Marcus Turovski"}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/triage-the-ethics-of-corona/av-52972140", "title": "Triage - the ethics of Corona | DW News - latest news and breaking stories | DW", "text": "Imagine you're a doctor.

", "text": "On Tuesday, Feb. 18, no Covid-19 cases had been reported in Iran. On Sunday, the government announced 43 cases and eight deaths. Some 152 cases (and at least three deaths) were confirmed in Italy on Sunday, up from three cases on Thursday. The number of infected people in South Korea jumped to 763 (and six deaths) in just days.\nAs of Monday, Covid-19 was detected in at least 29 countries. In nations with few or no reported cases so far, particularly in South America and Africa, the absence of evidence shouldn’t be interpreted as evidence of absence. More likely, it reflects lack of testing.\nIs the Covid-19 outbreak now a pandemic, whether or not the World Health Organization calls it that yet?\nIf so, what’s next?\nFirst, let’s get the facts straight about what can and cannot be done.\nIt’s now clear that the epidemic was never going to be contained. At most, its spread was slowed by the lockdown imposed in China and other countries’ efforts to identify infected people and anyone they might have been in contact with.\nThe coronavirus that causes Covid-19 seems to spread like influenza, through the air, person to person. Unlike Ebola, SARS and MERS, it can be transmitted by individuals before the onset of symptoms or even if they don’t become ill. An infected person appears to spread the disease to an average of 2.6 people. After 10 generations of transmission, with each taking about five or six days, that one initial case has spawned more than 3,500, most with no or mild symptoms, yet probably infectious. The fact that mild cases are difficult to differentiate from colds or the flu only complicates the diagnosis.\nIn light of the disease’s features, the quarantine of the passengers and crew members on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama Bay in Japan looks like a cruel experiment: While confined, these people were forced to breathe recycled air for two weeks. The measure achieved little except to prove just how effective the virus is at spreading. Trying to stop influenza-like transmission is a bit like trying to stop the wind.\nVaccines are many months away, at the earliest. And based on previous experiences with SARS, MERS and pandemic influenza, there is no reason to believe — as President Trump claimed — that Covid-19 will go away this spring as warmer weather arrives in the Northern Hemisphere. Transmission around the world could continue for months.\nThe lockdown imposed by the Chinese government in Hubei, the province worst hit by the disease, substantially reduced the number of new cases for a time. But even that has limited benefits. As China tries to return to work, public transportation resumes and citizens start moving about, there will likely be a major rebound in cases. Unless an entire population shelters in place for many months, infectious agents like influenza or this coronavirus will find people to infect.\nIn other words, a lockdown is mostly a delaying tactic. By distributing cases over time, it can help manage an outbreak — but only if it takes place against the backdrop of a robust health care system. Yet even the best system is too fragile, and a moderate increase in infectious cases, whether of seasonal flu or Covid-19, can quickly overwhelm resources, in China or the United States.\nAs chilling as it is to imagine this scenario, what happened in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicenter of the outbreak, will likely play out elsewhere, too. Hospitals might have to turn away all but the people most seriously ill; their ability to handle their usual load of patients with heart attacks, critical injuries or cancers may be severely compromised.\nIn a world ill-prepared for a potentially life-threatening, easily transmitted disease like Covid-19, the most effective way to mitigate the pandemic’s impact is to focus on supporting health care systems that already are overburdened.\nThis is the main reason every country’s top priority should be to protect its health care workers.\nThe United States and other countries in the Northern Hemisphere already are in the throes of a moderately serious flu season. Their inventories of protective equipment used by doctors, nurses and emergency medical workers — N-95 respirator masks, gloves, eye protection, disposable suits — are running low. These limited supplies must go to health care workers first, rather than the public. This is partly to ensure that hospitals themselves do not become sites where the coronavirus is spread more than it is contained: If infected health care workers die in large numbers, entire societies may be shaken to the point of panic.\nGovernments should also conduct Covid-19 preparedness drills in local hospitals and expand hospitals’ temporary capacity, for example, by setting up emergency tents in parking lots, as is already happening in some places in the United States. To minimize the strain on overstressed acute-care hospitals, supportive nursing care might have to be provided, in makeshift facilities and patients’ homes, as was done during severe pandemics in the past, such as the Great Influenza of 1918-19.\nThe manufacturing and distribution chains for drugs and other vital products like needles and syringes must remain open, and that, given the global nature of the industry, requires international cooperation. In keeping with World Health Organization guidelines, coronavirus-stricken countries shouldn’t be walled off the way that the United States and others are trying to do with China at the moment. Otherwise, as the virus spreads, we will be isolating ourselves, too, and will jeopardize our ability to obtain critical resources. Many of the active ingredients in lifesaving generic drugs — the ones that stock hospital crash carts and maintain our daily well-being — come from China and India. If that production is brought to a standstill, many people could die, not directly from Covid-19, but indirectly from a lack of access to those drugs.\nEnsuring all of this means facing the hard facts of this unfolding pandemic — and that requires thorough, transparent disclosures to the public. Past experiences, with the anthrax-laced letters in 2001 and the 2014 Ebola outbreak, suggest that people react more rationally and show greater resilience to a full-blown crisis if they are prepared intellectually and emotionally for it.\nAnd yet even those officials and experts who have candidly predicted a pandemic are not saying enough about what to expect and how to prepare. Basic information is still lacking, or isn’t getting through: According to a recent survey, 65 percent of people in Hong Kong had enough surgical masks for a month or more — this, even though such masks will do little to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\nSingapore, which is experiencing an outbreak despite a world-class medical and public health system — 89 cases as of Sunday — is the model to emulate. It is preparing its citizenry for a greater crisis still by providing it with explicit instructions and specific advisories about, for instance, attending large gatherings or sharing residential areas with people under home quarantine.\nAnd what should each of us do, beyond staying informed and washing our hands frequently? Keep calm and rational. It might be worth stocking some reserve of critical medications, for example — but not too much, because hoarding could create shortages.\nWe, as individuals, can also try to plan for basic contingencies. Companies can cross-train key staff members so that one person’s absence won’t derail the business. Family members and friends should be watchful of one another’s health and welfare, and stand prepared to care for the moderately ill if hospitals become overtaxed.\n“Pandemic” isn’t just a technical public health term. It also is — or should be — a rallying cry.\nMichael T. Osterholm is director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

Since then more than 235,000 lives have been lost to the disease, making it more deadly than the SARS, H1N1, MERS, and Ebola epidemics combined. But it is also killing more people than other, more familiar, causes of death.\nA back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that more people are dying from covid-19 globally than from almost anything else. According to the Global Burden of Disease, an annual study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) that tallies the lives lost to 282 illnesses and injuries across 195 countries and territories, diabetes was responsible for 20,000 deaths a week, on average, in 2017 (the latest year for which data are available). Road accidents killed 25,000 a week. Lung and tracheal cancers, 36,000. Lower respiratory infections, such as pneumonia and bronchitis, another 49,000. During one particularly deadly seven-day period in April, the coronavirus killed more than 50,000 (see chart).\nEven if it were to end tomorrow, covid-19 would still be among the leading causes of death in 2020 so far. At more than 235,000 lives lost according to official records, the disease currently ranks above breast cancer, malaria and Parkinson’s disease. And this figure is also almost certainly too low. In many countries, official covid-19 death tolls include only those who die in hospital or who have tested positive for the virus. Those who die elsewhere, or undiagnosed—as well as those killed by conditions that might normally be treated in intensive-care units now overwhelmed by covid-19 patients—are left out of the statistics.\nLockdowns imposed to halt the spread of the virus could have other long-term health effects. Routine screenings for some health conditions have been suspended in many countries (in parts of Britain, cancer referrals are down by nearly three-quarters). Meanwhile, social isolation is also taking a psychological toll. In Russia, vodka sales in the last week of March jumped by 31%. In America, gun sales in March were up by 85%. More alcohol and firearm use could contribute to more suicides.\nAmid the gloom, there are some bright spots. As people stay indoors under lockdown, there will be fewer road accidents, the eighth-leading cause of death worldwide. A reduction in air pollution will reduce the number of premature births; fewer people will suffer from asthma.\nWeekly covid-19 deaths are now falling. For the week ending April 29th, they were down to under 40,000. The worst may be over in the rich world, for now, and there is great uncertainty about how hard the virus will strike poor countries. But even if the virus is on the wane, for the past few weeks the human cost of the disease has been all too apparent."}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/06/russian-report-on-boris-johnsons-coronavirus-ventilation-disinformation-britain-says-a69876", "title": "Russian Report on Boris Johnson Coronavirus Ventilation  Disinformation , Britain Says", "text": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman dismissed as disinformation a Russian media report Monday that he was to undergo artificial lung ventilation after being hospitalized with persistent coronavirus symptoms.\nJohnson said he tested positive for coronavirus on March 27 and was due to re-emerge from seven days of self-isolation Friday.

Today, as covid-19 spreads around the world, authorities are encouraging similar measures to fight infection. In China, to avoid hand-shaking, people are being told to greet one another with a gong shou gesture, where a palm is folded over the opposite fist. In the Gulf, citizens are saying hello with a wave rather than the traditional “nose to nose” greeting. And in Italy and France, friends and acquaintances are eschewing the customary peck on both cheeks.\nSuch efforts are more effective than they might seem. A paper published in 2014 explored how greeting rituals spread infectious diseases. David Whitworth and Sara Mela, two biologists at Aberystwyth University in Wales, dipped a glove in bacteria, before using it to greet another person wearing a sterile glove. Bacteria can be transmitted in a similar way to the new coronavirus. They found that a handshake transfers almost twice as much bacteria as a high five, which in turn transmits twice that of a fist bump. The duration of greetings matters, too. Stronger and longer handshakes transfer more bacteria than weaker, shorter ones. The same goes for high fives.\nMany therefore seek to avoid any contact at all. Mike Pence, the American vice-president, has taken to greeting people with the “elbow-bump”, which was adopted in some places during past epidemics, eg, of avian flu and Ebola. The “Wuhan shuffle” involves bumping feet. And in Iran, which has the worst outbreak of covid-19 outside China, some have taken to bumping hips.\nSubstituting handshakes for fist, elbow and foot bumps may help slow the spread of covid-19. But epidemiologists say the most reliable way to stop the fast-spreading illness, which by March 6th infected more than 100,000 people and killed 3,400, is frequent and thorough hand-washing (the WHO recommends doing so five times a day). Like the common cold, covid-19 is thought to spread via droplets of moisture ejected when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or just speaks. Even without shaking hands, people can contract the disease by touching something an infected person has come into contact with, and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes. Handwashing helps prevent this.\nFor many, especially in poor countries, following this advice is easier said than done. According to the World Bank, only a quarter of people in sub-Saharan Africa have access to basic handwashing facilities including soap and water. In Ethiopia, the figure is just 8%; in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 4%. Still, changing habits can help. The disease has already reached the region.

The information can be vital for the people in the refugee camp and the surrounding area,\" said Mainul Khan, DW Akademie's trainer in Cox's Bazar.\nDW Akademie and Radio Naf have been working with young Rohingya and locals from villages near the refugee camp since 2018. Volunteers receive training and create stories from the camp for the weekly radio show \"Palonger Hota\" (\"Voice of Palong\").\nCamps still officially corona-free\nCurrently, Bangladesh reports only 164 officially confirmed corona-infections and 17 corona-induced deaths in the country (as of 07.04.2020, Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research). However, the World Health Organization (WHO) warns that refugees in camps are particularly at risk. If the coronavirus spreads in what is now the world's largest refugee camp with around one million inhabitants, a humanitarian catastrophe would be imminent.\n\"The people there live in appalling conditions, in tiny huts, and often the supply of clean water is a problem. When the virus gets there, I don't even want to imagine the consequences,\" said Khan.\nThe people in the refugee camp near the city of Cox's Bazar live crowded together in huts. \"Social distancing\" is almost impossible here\nThe camp has been overcrowded for a long time, and \"social distancing\" is extremely difficult. Officials are now scrambling to expand medical care in the camp but whether this will be enough is questionable. Beds are not the only supplies missing in treatment facilities. There is a general lack of equipment and personnel. Aid organizations are distributing soap and trying to ensure the water supply for everyone in the camp. If the virus does arrive, there is no escape for the Rohingya as the inhabitants are officially not allowed to leave the camp.\nFighting fear and insecurity\nThe loudspeaker broadcasts are intended to inform. About 70 percent of the Rohingya are considered illiterate so radio formats are therefore popular not only in times of crisis.\n\"We radio specialists now have a special responsibility. Access to information via other communication channels is difficult for the people in the refugee camp and the surrounding villages,\" said Khan.\nInforming the people in the camp without causing panic is now the top priority for the makers of \"Palonger Hota.\" The radio show will continue to be produced and broadcast, currently with a focus on topics concerning the coronavirus or Covid-19. \"We are now producing our third special broadcast,\" said Khan.\nIn addition to providing information on hygiene, \"coughing etiquette\" and social distancing to prevent the virus from spreading, there are also plans to address sensitive topics such as mental health and stigmatization. They are also preparing reports on how to deal with the dead and what a dignified funeral can look like.\nBefore the outbreak of the pandemic, the volunteers in the camps conducted interviews for their radio reports. This is no longer possible\nInforming under difficult conditions\nBangladesh is now under a strict curfew. The reports from the volunteers and their family members are recorded over the telephone and sent via the internet to the producer in the city.\n\"Even in Cox's Bazar City, we are not allowed to leave our accommodation,\" said Khan. \"The roads to the camp are closed, we cannot drive to our training room and meet our volunteers in person. They are also stuck in their huts in the camp or in the houses in the village, they cannot conduct interviews outside. All this is a real nightmare.\"\nThis is because internet access in and around the Rohingya camp has been extremely limited for about eight months now. Information is not only difficult to get out of the camp, but also difficult to get in.\n\"We want to educate everyone in the camp and in the immediate vicinity about the dangers of the coronavirus,\" said Khan. \"Saving lives is now the most important task for us and our partners.\""}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/13/russian-mother-escapes-quarantine-through-window-of-insanitary-hospital", "title": "Russian mother escapes quarantine through window of  insanitary  hospital", "text": "A Russian woman who escaped her coronavirus quarantine by climbing out of a hospital window has defended her decision, saying conditions in the facility were unsanitary and she was only detained because of a bureaucratic error.\nThe mother-of-two, from the central city of Samara, posted to Instagram to explain her actions after receiving public criticism.\nIt comes as the WHO warned that it is “far too early” to predict an end to the worldwide COVID-19 outbreak despite a “stabilisation” in the numbers of newly-confirmed cases in China.\nAmid global concern, many countries have quarantined recent arrivals from China, in some cases regardless of whether they have any symptoms.\nIn Russia, only two cases of COVID-19 have been reported. Nevertheless, the authorities have hospitalized hundreds of people who returned from China as a precaution.\nTwo Russian women who arrived from the beach vacation island of Hainan — 1,500km from Wuhan — were kept in isolation but later fled, citing uncooperative doctors, poor conditions and fear they would become infected. Russian health authorities haven't commented on their complaints.\nOne of the women, with a username Guzel Neder, posted a lengthy explanation on Instagram following a public backlash.\nShe said her son, Leo, came down with a cough and a fever of 37.3 C (99.2 F) four days after the family's return. She called emergency services, who diagnosed the boy as having a viral respiratory infection and who said the mother and the son must go to a hospital for coronavirus tests.\nThe hospital promised test results within three days, then extended it to five, she said, and meanwhile the boy responded to treatment with medication and an inhaler, she wrote.

Hoarding\nPanic buying for beginners\nSign-language interpreters rarely get noticed, let alone upstage the person they're signing for. But during the early stages of the coronavirus epidemic in Europe, a Dutch signer went viral when she translated a government minister’s warning not to hoard food with a pinched nose and rodent-like clawing with her hands. She was signing the word “hamsteren”, which means stuffing food into your cheeks like a hamster, or, as it’s more commonly used, to hoard.\nThe Netherlands prides itself on frugality and household thrift. So until recently the verb mostly had jolly connotations: annual supermarket promotional events (“de hamsterweken”) rewarded star hamsters who were stocking up on supplies. Germans use a similar word, “Hamsterkauf”. Whereas the English word “hoarding” refers to something secretive, which happens when nobody is watching, “hamsteren” is clearly visible and speaks to the much-celebrated Dutch openness.\nOpenness has turned to shame as the outbreak advanced. In the Netherlands, as elsewhere, people have “hamstered” in supermarkets as they worried about disruptions to supply chains and being isolated indoors. “Hamsteren is not nice,” Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said in a press conference; later he called it “retarded”. Shops are calling on people to stop the practice too, and social-media memes ridicule the hoarders. Albert Heijn, a supermarket chain that organises annual hamster weeks, called off the yearly promotion that was supposed to start in April. The Dutch had already filled their cheeks.\nSacha Nauta\nGeisterspiel\n1. ghost game (noun)\nA football match needs more than 22 players\nMarch 11th was an odd milestone for German football: it was the first ever Geisterspiel, or ghost game in the Bundesliga, German football's top-flight division. As coronavirus was spreading across the country, the city of Mönchengladbach in west Germany decreed that the match against FC Cologne, a Rhineland derby, would now take place without fans. Inside the deserted 54,000-seater stadium the announcer rattled through his usual script: team line-ups, league standings, and then, finally, spectator numbers: “Today, there are none.” The hosts won 2-1, but the victory felt hollow. \"It is sport without a heart,\" wrote Die Zeit, a weekly.\nGeisterspiele have a long history in football. The word once referred to games so obscured by winter fog that players were reduced to spectres and the ball had to be imagined. The modern usage arose in the 1980s, when footballing authorities banned supporters of lower-league teams from attending specific matches as a punishment for hooliganism. This year, fans barely had time to get used to the coronavirus-induced Geisterspiele before the German football season, like most in Europe, was suddenly suspended.\nWith no end in sight to Germany's restrictions on mass gatherings Christian Seifert, head of the German Football League, says that Geisterspiele might be the only way to conclude the season. Much is at stake: Germany’s is the world's third most valuable league, and some teams fear that they will go bankrupt if the season is voided. Yet Geisterspiele bring their own problems; during their team’s game against Cologne, hundreds of Mönchengladbach fans defied the club’s appeals and assembled outside, hoping that their cheers would penetrate the empty stadium. In a novel turn of events, the ghost game was haunted by humans.\nTom Nuttall\nCovidiot\n1. Someone who ignores public health advice (noun)\nWhere there are rules, there are those who break them\nEven in a pandemic, many of us are prone to judge others and find them wanting: the term “covidiot” describes any and every person behaving stupidly or irresponsibly as the epidemic spreads. Sometime in early March the word was born, and, almost as fast as the virus spread, so did instances of covidiotic behaviour.\nThe panic-buyers who left supermarket shelves bare of toilet paper and pasta were among the first to earn the title covidiot in Britain, America and elsewhere. Soon, as government lockdowns were put in place, they were followed by those who ignored public health warnings to stay home. These new covidiots held barbecues on beaches, sunbathed in parks and, in one particularly extreme instance, a covidiot wiped his own saliva on goods at a British supermarket. In Florida bull-headed youths on spring break flooded bars and beaches; one shirtless partygoer told news reporters, “If I get corona, I get corona. At the end of the day, I’m not going to let it stop me from partying.” The label has also been used to describe those expounding conspiracy theories about the origins of covid-19, and others warning not to get any eventual coronavirus vaccine as being “from the pit of hell”.\nAt least the term is a democratic one. The label has been applied from the highest office to the lowest. Like the virus itself, no one is immune.\nAlia Shoaib\n你别来我无恙 (nǐbiélái wǒwúyàng)\n1. If you don’t come, I won’t come to any harm\nCatching an old Chinese expression\nPeople in China often use an old pleasantry, 别来无恙 (biéláiwúyàng), to greet each other after a long time apart. The literal translation is “I hope nothing bad has happened since we last said farewell”. In common parlance the phrase essentially means, “I hope you’ve been well”. It’s respectful, but conveys warmth and care too.\nBut the term’s ancient origins have new bearing in the time of covid-19. According to “I Ching”, the “Book of Changes”, a book on divination and wisdom from the ninth century BC, the final character of the expression, 恙 (yàng), originally referred to a highly contagious bug that caused acute fever and a rash. In its early usage, then, people used this phrase to ask someone if they have become infected since they’d last met – the expression was uttered partly to wish someone well, partly as a warning to stay away if they were contagious.\nThis meaning had long passed out of the popular consciousness, but as the outbreak of coronavirus spread, the original use made an unexpected comeback. A new phrase, 你别来我无恙 (nǐbiélái wǒwúyàng) means “if you don’t come, I won’t come to any harm”. This reconfiguring of the old idiom was bandied around as the epidemic moved across China, a means to promote social distancing between friends and family. It was a playful nod to history, with a serious message: if you wish me well, stay away.\nFrankie Huang\nQuatorzaine\n1. 14-day isolation period (noun)\nThe French almost make isolation sound romantic\nThe French language helped to give the English-speaking world the term “quarantine”, which derives from quarantaine, meaning a period of 40 days. There are references to its use in French, presumed to be of biblical origin, as early as the 12th century. It was during the plague in the 14th century that Italy used the word quarantena to refer specifically to isolation for reasons of disease. Venetians employed the term to describe the period of time a ship had to wait in port as a sanitary precaution before its crew could disembark. In short, the English language borrowed the word from French and the definition from Italian.\nNow the French have dug up another word, quatorzaine, to refer to the 14-day self-isolation period recommended during the covid-19 crisis. “How many pupils are en quatorzaine?” a French radio host asked the education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, shortly before he closed down schools in March. “Two doctors en quatorzaine” runs a typical newspaper headline.\nThe French language lends itself to such linguistic formations: a dizaine, derived from the number dix, means ten of something; a douzaine, derived from douze, means 12. So talking about somebody being en quatorzaine rolls easily off the French tongue. Its anglicised version, on the other hand, would involve referring to somebody being “in quatorzine”. That may appeal for reasons of brevity, but, with time less at a premium these days, it seems unlikely to replace the more long-winded English phrase “in 14-day isolation”.\nSophie Pedder\nUntore\n1. Plague spreader (noun)\nWhat Italians have learned from plague-themed literary classics\nAs the world adjusts to life under quarantine, many have sought refuge in the pages of plague-themed literature. Sales of Albert Camus’ “The Plague”, about a disease-infested Algerian town in the 1940s, have soared; one publisher has struggled to keep up with orders.\nItalians have also re-embraced two national literary classics. Alessandro Manzoni’s “The Betrothed”, a classroom staple published in 1827, is set partly in Milan during the plague of 1630. In it, outsiders suspected of deliberately spreading the disease are labelled untori. The allegation was previously directed at Jews accused of propagating the plague in 1348. With the current coronavirus onslaught the word has crept back into use.\nThe noun untore comes from the verb ungere, meaning “to grease”; unto means “oily”. In “The Betrothed” the untori supposedly sought to infect as many people as possible with their unguento, “ointment”. The word has now resurfaced in reference to Chinese people accused of bringing covid-19 to Italy, and to lambast the way that many Italians were treated by countries with fewer cases. When China sent medical equipment one headline ran “From untore to samaritan”. The usage develops as the outbreak spread. The latest untori are the runners who pound the pavement despite the lockdown , and three Red Cross medics who returned from Lombardy, Italy’s worst-hit region, to Puglia in the south only to be harassed by neighbours.\nIf Manzoni offers insight into the human instinct to find scapegoats, an earlier classic has some practical advice. In Giovanni Boccaccio’s “Decameron”, ten people isolate themselves in a villa outside Florence during the plague of 1348 and recount stories, some sexually explicit, to pass the time. Fiction continues to offer both inspiration and solace\nAlexandra Fattal\nCoronaspeck\n1. Coronavirus fat (noun)\nSome Germans are feeding their fear\nGerman workers ordered to stay at home to help the government flatten one sort of curve have found themselves battling the emergence of another, just above the belt. Home workouts sound great, but the days are long and dull and your latest bout of Hamsterkäufe (panic-buying; lit. \"hamster-purchase\") has left the fridge gloriously well-stocked. There's always another variety of Ritter Sport to try, oder? Anyway, what's a few kilos between socially distanced friends?\nCoronaspeck is the helpful German word for the fat deposited by weeks of stay-at-home grazing. Shoppers in Germany may know Speck as a bacon-like foodstuff, perhaps found on a crisp Flammkuchen or inside hearty Swabian Maultaschen. But its broader meaning corresponds to something like the English \"flab\". Babyspeck, for example, is the puppy fat that lingers into adolescence; Winterspeck a memento of excessive indulgence in cold months. Best known is Kummerspeck, or \"sorrow-fat\": think a tear-streaked Bridget Jones devouring tubs of ice-cream in the throes of a break-up.\nHow can Coronaspeck be combatted? Happily, Germany’s lockdown is a notch more tolerant than those of some neighbours. There is no limit on the number of excursions for exercise or other essential purposes. And if the neologism identifies one of the downsides of the corona-crisis, an older noun may inspire some to meet the challenge. Sitzfleisch (lit. \"sitting-meat\") can mean one’s bottom, but it is also the ability, much-prized in Germany, to endure or stick something out. The country’s restrictions will not expire until April 19th at the earliest. What better test of a nation’s ability to resist the temptations of the pantry?\nTom Nuttall\nMiss Rona\n1. A new way to refer to covid-19 online (noun)\nQueer and black slang creates a coronavirus colloquialism\nThe prickly sphere of the novel coronavirus has become a familiar sight. Now imagine the same sphere, but badly photoshopped with hoop earrings, Mrs Potatohead lips and fake nails. This is one artistic rendering of “Miss Rona”, a reference to covid-19 online that started, like many American speech fads, among queer and black users on Twitter.\n“Gay men always add ‘miss’ to popular things,” says Aaron Leigh, a black, gay podcaster based in Atlanta. “‘Miss Rona’ basically means it has a nasty attitude or it’s a sassy virus.” In black culture, too, adding “Miss” usually means you’re thought of as messy or problematic, says Jonathan Higgins, a queer, black writer. The personification captures the mundane ways in which the virus has disrupted our lives: cancelling our plans, testing our relationships, watching over us as we wash our hands until they’re scaly.\nMany American colloquialisms originate in queer or black slang, such as “slay,” “yasss,” and “work” or “fleek” and “bae”, though their origins are rarely acknowledged. This one is spreading even further: teens as far as South-East Asia now have “Miss Rona” as their display names on Twitter. As the pandemic rages, it’s not just the virus that’s spreading.\nKrithika Varagur\nGriķi\n1. buckwheat (noun)\n2. panic food\nA Latvian staple becomes a symbol of mockery\nFew foods emulate what it means to be Latvian as well as buckwheat, a canteen staple from the Soviet era that has been grown in the Baltics for centuries. Often served with kotletes (pork cutlets) or karbonāde (pork schnitzel), the versatile grain featured in hundreds of national folk songs. But, amid the coronavirus crisis, buckwheat has become the subject of ridicule among many Latvians.\nWhen Australia went under lockdown, locals hoarded so much toilet paper that the worst offenders were dubbed “magpies”. In Britain supermarket shelves were stripped of pasta. In Latvia it was buckwheat that the hoarders went for. A Latvian TV channel reported that shops in Riga were “cleaned out” of buckwheat; some supermarkets saw a 99% increase in sales of the grain in the last week of February, compared with the last week of January this year.\nBuckwheat quickly became a symbol of mockery in national news headlines and on social media, as an embodiment of panic and fear over covid-19. Comparisons were made between buckwheat and garlic, which is widely used as a natural remedy to treat colds and coughs in Latvia. The phrase “griķi is the new ķiploki (garlic)” was soon coined by Latvian Twitter users, and one Latvian public official suggested that if Latvians lined the perimeter of their country with buckwheat they might even be able to ward off “the new virus”. Some Latvians seem to have enough of the stuff to do so.\nRičards Umbraško\n抄作业 (chāo zuò yè)\n1. To copy homework (verb)\n2. To steal China’s ingenuity without giving credit\nChinese social-media users think other countries are copying their homework\nIt used to be that, if you searched 抄作业 “chao zuoye” on Chinese social media, you’d see tales of students plagiarising or cheating on tests: the term means to copy someone’s homework. Chao means to copy, and zuoye means school assignments. But zuoye can also refer to work in a more general sense, which has allowed the phrase to take on a new meaning amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nAs the virus has spread around the world, the lockdown is slowly being lifted in China and life in some parts of the country appears to be slowly returning to a (new) normal. Many are now watching to see how other countries fight covid-19. “Streets in Malaysia are really copying homework,” says a user on Weibo, a Twitter-like service, alongside a slideshow of public-service posters across Malaysia. The pictures show red banners with public-health slogans printed in white – a stylistic format that Chinese propagandists have used since long before the current pandemic. One Chinese blogger wrote that the National Basketball Association in America was copying the Chinese Basketball Association’s homework, after ESPN reported that the NBA was studying the CBA’s tactics for hosting games during China’s lockdown.\nTo say another country is copying homework is to be patriotic, but with snark. When another country copies China’s homework, users mean that it’s deploying tactics pioneered by China, without giving credit. This sentiment was particularly prevalent among Chinese Weibo users when Donald Trump labelled covid-19 the “Chinese virus,” drawing attention – and blame – to the global pandemic’s source. As the virus spreads in the West, many commenters on Weibo have called the health crisis facing America an “open-book exam”. As ever, China is keen to be top of the class.\nNoelle Mateer\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus tracker and story hub"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/international/2020/04/23/would-be-autocrats-are-using-covid-19-as-an-excuse-to-grab-more-power", "title": "Protection racket - Would - be autocrats are using covid - 19 as an excuse to grab more power | International", "text": "ON APRIL 13TH, during a discussion about when and how America should ease covid-19 lockdowns, Donald Trump claimed to have “absolute power” to decide, overriding state governors. Within a day, he was forced to retreat. No serious legal scholar agreed with him—America’s constitution is admirably clear on the limits to presidential authority.\nContrast that with Viktor Orban’s efforts. On March 30th Hungary’s parliament issued a “coronavirus law”, giving the prime minister almost unlimited powers to rule by decree, with no expiry date. Parliament can repeal Mr Orban’s new powers, but since his party has an impregnable majority, it probably won’t. Mr Orban has in effect become a dictator—in the heart of Europe. He may relinquish some of his new powers after the pandemic, just to prove his critics wrong, but perhaps not all.\nCovid-19 is creating opportunities for autocrats and would-be autocrats to tighten their grip. They must assume extraordinary powers, they insist, to protect public health. No fewer than 84 countries have declared a state of emergency since the pandemic began, says the Centre for Civil and Political Rights, a watchdog in Geneva. Some will surrender these powers when the emergency is over. Others plan to hang on to them. The danger is greatest not in mature democracies with strong checks and balances, such as America, but in places where such safeguards are weak, such as Hungary.\nMr Orban has spent the past decade eroding checks on his power, nobbling the courts, tilting the electoral system and urging his cronies to gobble up independent radio and television stations. Mr Trump’s claim of absolute power was laughed at; Hungarian media welcomed Mr Orban’s corona coronation, and Hungarian institutions did nothing to block it.\nUnscrupulous politicians have seen opportunity in disaster before. Vladimir Putin grabbed extra powers after a school siege involving terrorists in Beslan, a town near Russia’s border with Georgia. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan imposed a state of emergency after a failed coup in 2016, and has since ruled like a sultan. This pandemic presents an even greater opportunity for mischief, because it is raging everywhere at once. The world’s attention is on the virus. No repressive act in a far-off land is likely to make headlines elsewhere.\nChina chose now to arrest Hong Kong’s leading pro-democracy activists and puncture its Basic Law (see article). “Dictators and others may think there’s no better time to take repressive measures,” says Rob Malley of the International Crisis Group, an NGO in Brussels.\nSerbia’s president is in effect in sole charge. Togo’s has the power to rule by decree, though in theory it runs out in a few months. Cambodia’s emergency law gives the government the power to take any “measures that are deemed appropriate” to fight the disease. It can restrict people’s movement, ban public gatherings, censor social media, seize property and declare martial law. Anyone who fails to “respect” the law faces up to ten years in prison. The prime minister, Hun Sen, can act without any real oversight. Though his ministers say the measures will last for only three months, they can be extended indefinitely.\nSuch powers far exceed any that democratic governments have assumed to fight covid-19, but the regimes in question try to portray them as normal. “The purpose of making this law for Cambodia is not unique, as there is this law already in many other democratic countries,” says a spokesman for the ministry of justice.\nSome curbs on freedom are reasonable given the scale of the emergency. Large gatherings can spread infection, so limiting them for a while makes sense. But it also helps regimes keen to snuff out protests. Algeria banned street marches that have lasted, off and on, for a year, threatening the elderly ruling elite. India’s lockdown has squashed nationwide rallies against the government’s mistreatment of Muslims. In Russia even lone protesters against Mr Putin have been arrested.\nSocial-distancing rules can be applied selectively. Azerbaijan’s president says the “isolation” of members of the opposition may “become a historical necessity”. Several have been locked up for supposedly violating a lockdown. Unpopular minorities are also at risk. In Uganda police raided a shelter housing 20 gay and transgender people and later charged them with “congesting in a school-like-dormitory setting within a small house”.\nDefeating the virus will require tracking who has been infected, tracing their contacts and quarantining them. This may involve intrusive surveillance. Most people will surrender some privacy temporarily to save lives. Good governments will take only the data they need from their citizens and do so only when they need it. Others will not.\nCambodia’s emergency law allows for unlimited surveillance of private citizens. Moscow is mulling a scheme whereby everyone would have to register their personal details on an official website. Every time they want to go out, they would have to provide a reason and the address of their destination. They will then be sent an electronic message to show to the police if they are stopped. The authorities would monitor everyone’s geolocation and even financial records to make sure they comply. The potential for abuse is obvious.\nSpreading rumours during a pandemic can be dangerous. Many regimes have used this as an excuse to crack down on critics. Reporters without Borders, a watchdog, cites 38 countries that have used covid-19 as a pretext to harass the media. It stresses that the list is not exhaustive.\nIn Turkey at least eight journalists have been arrested on charges of “spreading misinformation”. Hundreds of others have been investigated for critical posts on social media. In Bolivia the interim president, Jeanine Áñez, decreed that those who “misinform or cause uncertainty to the population” can be jailed for one to ten years. Since she has a record of forcing opposition radio stations off the air, critics fear this will become a tool to lock them up.\nSome governments have criminalised almost any disparagement of their response to the pandemic. A Thai artist called Danai Ussama faces up to five years in prison after griping that no one took his temperature at Bangkok airport.\n“Censorship kills,” says Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch. “When governments suppress the free flow of information, it is terrible for public health, as we saw in Wuhan. The Chinese government’s muzzling of the doctors who sounded the warning gave the virus a three-week head-start to go global.” A study by the University of Southampton found that if interventions in China had started three weeks earlier, the number of coronavirus cases would have been 95% lower at the end of February, “significantly limiting the geographical spread of the disease.”\nSome governments are enforcing lockdowns harshly. Several Indian states now allow the police to arrest people without charge. In Fiji there have been more coronavirus-related arrests than diagnostic tests. Kenyan cops have beaten health workers on their way to work.\nIn El Salvador more than 2,000 people have been locked up for violating strict social-distancing rules, often defeating their purpose. Its Supreme Court has told the government to stop arbitrarily detaining people in inhumane conditions that are likely to spread the disease. But its fiery president, Nayib Bukele, has refused (via Twitter) to obey it. Thus, covid-19 has precipitated a constitutional crisis in one of Latin America’s most violent countries.\nGetting la grippe\nIndonesia and the Philippines have given the army prime responsibility for fighting the novel coronavirus. In some ways this is pragmatic: only the armed forces can operate effectively across these two archipelago states. They are also popular. “They abhor useless debates. They are silent workers, not voracious talkers. They act without fanfare. They get things done,” said a spokesman for Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines. Even so, there are worries. Mr Duterte has publicly urged the security forces to shoot troublemakers dead. Fortunately, they appear to have ignored him, but in the long run, turning to the men in uniform during a public-health crisis risks weakening civilian oversight.\nThe pandemic is seriously disrupting elections. South Korea showed in April that a well-governed rich country can organise a vote while maintaining social distance. Poorer, less orderly places find it harder. For some leaders, that is a welcome excuse to delay their reckoning with voters.\nCourt-ordered re-runs of rigged elections in Bolivia have been postponed. Those in Malawi could be delayed, too. That would leave the presidency with Peter Mutharika, whose victory last year was ruled invalid after his supporters used Tipp-Ex to alter vote tallies.\nSome leaders are holding votes on schedule, knowing that the opposition will barely be able to campaign, whereas the incumbent can look statesmanlike on television. Poland’s ruling party wants to go ahead with a presidential election in May for this reason, though it could still be delayed. Guinea held a referendum on March 22nd to allow President Alpha Condé to run for two more terms. The proposal passed easily. Guinea now has almost 700 covid-19 cases and possibly 12 more years of Mr Condé, who has advised Guineans to inhale menthol and drink hot water to ward off the virus.\nEthiopia’s elections, which are set for August, were supposed to herald the dawn of a new democratic era. They have been postponed and the government has assumed emergency powers. During previous states of emergency in 2016 and 2018, tens of thousands of dissidents were locked up in re-education camps or tortured. The current prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, has promised that such abuses are all in the past. But if elections are not held by September, his government will no longer have a mandate, and Ethiopia’s ethnic insurgencies could explode.\nStrongman flu\nSome governments have used the disease itself to intimidate the opposition. Crowded jails are hotbeds of infection. Dissidents understand that detention could be lethal. Turkey has ordered a mass release of up to 90,000 prisoners to spare them from contracting covid-19. The country’s thousands of political prisoners are conspicuously excluded from the amnesty.\nSome governments are looking for scapegoats. In India that means Muslims. After it was discovered that a Muslim religious meeting on March 15th was the source of more than 1,000 infections, the Hindu nationalist government made every effort to publicise this fact. For several days the ministry of health counted separately covid cases tied to the event. A cabinet member likened it to a crime by the Taliban. Health authorities assiduously traced every single case from the Delhi meeting, ultimately putting some 25,000 people under quarantine. They have made no such effort with any other vector, such as the huge wedding party of a ruling-party bigwig. #CoronaJihad proliferated on social media, along with rumours that Muslims were spitting in people’s food to spread the virus. Muslims have been attacked in the streets. A cancer hospital in Meerut said that it would not take Muslim patients unless they tested negative for covid-19.\nBlaming Muslims is a handy way to fire up Hindu nationalist voters and distract attention from the fact that, at the time of the notorious Muslim prayer meeting, the government had yet to take the virus seriously. “Having spent years painting [Muslims] as a demographic, cultural, sexual, and security threat, it is now busily painting them as a biohazard,” complains Mitali Saran in the Deccan Herald.\nSuch bigotry not only stokes violence; it also harms public health. Many Muslims are now so suspicious of the government that they are unwilling to co-operate with quarantine rules. In Muslim slums medics have been attacked because of rumours that they are gathering data on Muslims in order to harm them. It was not until April 19th that the prime minister, Narendra Modi, made any effort to soothe sectarian tempers. “Covid-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or borders,” he tweeted. “We are in this together.”\nMany leaders want credit for handing out taxpayers’ cash to tide people over during the crisis. Mr Modi is leaning on rich Indians as well as government workers to donate to a special “PM-CARES” relief fund. It is unclear how the new pot differs from an emergency relief fund that Indian prime ministers have run since 1948, except that it has less oversight and Mr Modi can claim to have launched it.\nSome rulers are equally keen that their opponents should get no credit for helping the needy. Turkey is investigating the opposition mayors of Istanbul and Ankara for trying to raise funds to fight covid-19. Mr Erdogan likened them to terrorists. In Uganda President Yoweri Museveni cautions that “opportunistic politicians who try to distribute food will be arrested and charged with attempted murder.” His government claims that chaotic food distribution will draw crowds that will spread the virus. His foes think he wants to stop them from looking good by doing good.\nFor now, covid-19 is helping autocrats grab more power. But it poses big risks for them, too. The damage it wreaks will be vast and painful, especially in poor countries. Many despots will struggle to protect their subjects from disease and deprivation. Mr Putin is losing popularity because of his aloof response to the virus. Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, who scoffs at lockdowns and recently led a rally where placard-wavers called for a coup, could be impeached for incompetence after this crisis. Some are flailing. President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus said the best way to fight the virus was to drink vodka and drive a tractor.\nSome regimes may run out of money. Venezuela’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, looks particularly vulnerable. The combination of covid-19 and an oil-price crash may leave his regime without enough cash to fund its patronage network—and to keep the army loyal. Covid-19 challenges many regimes that rely on the security forces to suppress dissent.\nWhere governments are seen as legitimate, and where they try to ease the economic pain, people are more likely to comply with lockdowns. In many countries, however, the state is seen as predatory and the police as bullies. In them a backlash is brewing that thuggish cops will struggle to control. Protests against lockdowns have erupted in many countries, including parts of China. More may follow if the pandemic lasts for months, as it probably will.\nPandemocrats\nMany autocrats fear losing control. An incident in Cambodia is suggestive. Mr Hun Sen admitted in an unguarded moment that his government lacks the money to tide people over during the outbreak. “If motorbike-taxi drivers go bankrupt, sell your motorbikes for spending money,” he said. When a director of a news site accurately quoted this insensitive comment, it was shut down and he was arrested.\nSeven years ago Mr Hun Sen was rattled by huge protests by disgruntled factory workers. Cambodia’s garment factories are now laying off workers, who are more desperate and angry than before. In many countries covid-19 may foster instability. Autocracies have no immunity. ■\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus tracker and story hub\nThis article appeared in the International section of the print edition under the headline \"Protection racket\""}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/f68e0c508d01d0492507abe107d61a6b", "title": "Australian evacuees from virus - hit ship begin 2nd quarantine", "text": "Australian evacuees from virus-hit ship begin 2nd quarantine\nSYDNEY (AP) — Around 180 Australians evacuated from a virus-stricken cruise ship in Japan arrived Thursday in the city of Darwin to begin a second quarantine period.\nThe former cruise ship passengers will spend the next two weeks in a camp facility near the northern Australian city, health officials said.\nThe new coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 illness has infected more than 620 people on the Diamond Princess.\nThe ship has been docked at the port of Yokohama since early this month in a quarantine that was widely considered a failure.

As if from nowhere, Rohingya men and boys emerge, filling the narrow trenches that run between their bamboo-and-tarpaulin shelters. Some wear masks that match their prayer caps—lip-service to the soldiers on patrol as their wearers flout a ban on gatherings.\nThey are refugees from Myanmar, where the army has been mass-murdering Muslim Rohingya and burning their villages. Many have lost faith in earthly authorities to protect them. “Allah will save us from corona,” says one mosque-goer.\nAs covid-19 ravages the globe, more and more governments are urging their citizens to stay at home. Such advice is impossible to follow for those who have been driven from theirs. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that there are more than 70m forcibly displaced people worldwide, including almost 30m refugees and more than 40m who have fled to other parts of their own country. The refugee camps and informal settlements where many now dwell were ill-equipped to meet their basic needs, even before the pandemic broke out. Already Greece has quarantined two refugee camps—one on the island of Euboea and one near Athens—after residents tested positive for the virus. If, or more likely when, it arrives in other camps, it will find the environment far more hospitable than the refugees themselves did.\nConditions in the camps are ideal for the virus to spread. For a start, many are crowded. Lambasia is one part of the refugee settlement—made up of 34 camps—in the border district of Cox's Bazar. Home to more than 850,000 Rohingya, the camps house 40,000 people per square kilometre. For comparison, it is twice as densely populated as the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship quarantined in a Japanese port in February, on which more than 700 cases were confirmed within a month of the first passenger testing positive. And some camps are even more jam-packed—Moria, on the Greek island of Lesbos that is home to refugees from across the Middle East and Africa, has a density five times that of the Cox’s Bazar camps. Social distancing, the mainstay of covid response in the rest of the world, is not possible.\nIn many countries, social-isolation policies have created anxiety, and led to some panic-buying and hoarding. For refugees, worries about the supply of essential goods are more fundamental. Many receive the bulk of their food from NGOs. Almost half of the Rohingya in the camps do not have enough to eat. Residents of the Nyarugusu camp in north-western Tanzania, home to refugees from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo, also complain about their rations. “Sometimes we receive flour mixed with sand, or beans so old they have to be cooked for two days,” complains a former teacher called Céline, who is now one of their elected representatives.\nAccess to water and sanitation can be tricky, too. To go to the toilet or wash their hands, the residents of the Cox’s Bazar camps must stand in long queues. Deepmala Mahla, Asia regional director of CARE International, a charity, worries that the water-point could be where they catch covid-19. Soap and other sanitary products are often in short supply. Before the pandemic, residents of Nyarugusu received free one small bar of soap a month for personal hygiene and cleaning clothes, and distribution could be irregular. “You have to choose between buying food and buying soap,” says Marie, leader of a Christian civil-society group.\nMost troubling of all, as camps around the world brace for the pandemic’s arrival, is the lack of access to medical care. Syrian refugees who make it to Turkey can rely on a robust system of free health care. Those on the other side of the border, in Idlib province, have no such protection. Having escaped one indiscriminate killer, Bashar al-Assad, they risk being cut down by the pandemic. Hundreds of thousands have huddled into squalid tent camps or abandoned homes.\nHospitals across the region are unprepared to cope with covid-19. About 70 have been bombed. Many others have had to relocate. Those still operational have fewer than 100 ventilators between them, says Abdul Hakim Ramadan, public-health co-ordinator at the Idlib Health Directorate. The province is now home to at least 3m people. Exhausted health workers lack the most basic equipment. Waseem Zakaria, an Idlib city doctor, says many do not even have surgical masks. If the virus spreads unchecked, he says, up to 100,000 people would need a place in intensive care. Only 200 are currently available.\nThings are often little better in formal refugee camps. Nyarugusu used to have a surplus of medicine, drawing in Tanzanians from the local villages unable to afford health care. Since then, medicine has become scarcer. In February camp residents began to demand that the Tanzanian Red Cross, which supplies health services to the camp, leave. “People are angry because there is no medicine,” says Céline. “As we are talking, people are dying.” If the virus reaches the camps, this combination of inadequate medical resources and strained relations between camp residents and health-care providers could prove fatal.\nThe conditions in the camps are bad enough. And even host governments willing to help refugees do not always have the resources to do so. More than 80% of refugees and almost all internally displaced people have taken shelter in low- and middle-income countries. As the virus rages, many are struggling to meet the needs of their own citizens.\nOften their hosts are only too keen to see the displaced go home. In Nyarugusu, since July last year residents have endured the sort of lockdown now in place in many countries because of the pandemic. Concerts and sports were banned because of the supposed risk of violence. These restrictions were followed by efforts to encourage Burundians to go home. In August 2019 the Tanzanian and Burundian governments agreed that 180,000 refugees should go back to their country of origin “whether voluntarily or not”. Both governments claim that Burundi is now safe. Human-rights activists disagree, and given the current Tanzanian government’s callous attitude to refugees, it is hard to imagine that it will do enough to protect them.\nIn Cox’s Bazar, the Bangladeshi authorities, in order to stop the Rohingya mobilising and staging protests, have banned them from using mobile phones and shut down the internet in the camps. This prevents NGOs, whose access to the camps has been curtailed, from disseminating crucial information about the virus using WhatsApp and other social media (a technique that has proved effective with refugees in, for example, Kenya and the Philippines). Human Rights Watch, a pressure group, has urged the Bangladeshi government to lift the ban but has received no response.\nWithout the internet, NGOs are disseminating information through pamphlets, megaphones and radios. But these methods are far less pervasive, leaving a void, easily filled by rumours. Some call covid-19 “morona bhairas”, meaning dying virus, believing it to be fatal. Others claim it can be prevented by consuming various concoctions, including a mixture of salt and sugar, a popular diarrhoea cure. Some even believe that doctors kill those who are found to have the virus. According to one aid worker, hostility to the humanitarian organisations is rising as long-standing distrust is exacerbated by worries about aid workers bringing the disease into the camps. This is not a baseless fear. In the wake of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Nepalese peacekeepers were responsible for the first outbreak of cholera in the country in more than a century. Covid-19 is far easier to transmit.\nDespite this, humanitarian groups are making efforts to prepare refugee camps worldwide for the virus. Health-care centres, hand-washing stations and medical-isolation facilities have been hastily thrown up. At Nyarugusu, the UNHCR has doubled soap rations and spread food distribution out over several days to thin crowds. It has undertaken similar efforts in Bangladesh and at camps across the world. Time is of the essence—cases of covid-19 have been reported on Lesbos, leading doctors to call for a complete evacuation of Moria.\nWhatever help NGOs can provide, it is unlikely to reach Idlib, where sometimes several families are forced to share one tent, access to running water, food, and electricity remains scarce and there is no authority to impose any form of lockdown. Asking people to wash their hands thoroughly in warm water sounds like a cruel joke. “There is not enough water to start with,” says Mr Ramadan, the public-health co-ordinator. He says an outbreak in the camps would be calamitous: “the knock-out blow”. For the time being, a ceasefire negotiated by Turkey and Russia in early March seems to be holding. Should the fighting resume, it would mean yet more displacement, increasing the risk of the virus spreading. The frozen front-line may be Idlib’s last line of defence against covid-19.\nIf the virus arrives at the camps, it will inevitably breach the NGOs’ hastily thrown up fortifications. “We, the humanitarian community, are definitely not ready,” says CARE International’s Ms Mahla. Social distancing is usually impossible and lockdowns are already second nature to refugees, leaving little room for manoeuvre. Existing scarcities—of medicine and protective equipment, of food and clean water—will be exacerbated. Aid workers are right to be terrified of the potential impact of the virus. Sadly, at a time of global panic, it will be all too easy for the rest of the world to ignore their pleas."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/world/middleeast/israel-election-coronavirus.html", "title": "As Another Election Looms , Israelis Ponder Politics , and Contagion", "text": "TEL AVIV — For passengers hurrying through the departures hall of Israel’s main airport on Sunday, many with their faces covered by masks, there was one big conundrum: Should they stay or should they go?\nIt wasn’t just the threat of the coronavirus spreading around the world that made them think twice about traveling. It was the thought of missing Israel’s general election on Monday — the country’s third in less than a year.\n“I really want to have an effect on the election,” said Romi Zehavi, a 19-year-old off to ski in the Alps.\nHer conscience was ultimately assuaged by the thought that Monday’s vote would most likely end in yet another stalemate, and yet another chance to vote later in the year.\nSo Ms. Zehavi stuck with the skiing.\n“It’s fine, we have a lot of elections here,” she said, her voice slightly muffled by her face mask. “There’s always a chance of another one.”\nWith less than a day until polls opened, Israel was in a mild frenzy this weekend, as the twin storms of the coronavirus epidemic and an increasingly vicious political campaign began to collide.\nAs Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his chief rival, Benny Gantz, made last-gasp efforts to drive voters to the polls, some Israelis were wondering whether it was safe to cast ballots at all.\nTo date, the coronavirus has had fairly limited direct effect in Israel, with about 10 confirmed cases inside the country. But there was public alarm after several Israelis contracted the virus aboard a Japanese cruise ship, and nine South Korean tourists tested positive for the illness after returning home from a week in Israel.\nThe Israeli authorities have also adopted more stringent travel restrictions than many other governments. Nonresidents arriving from countries where the illness has taken root, like Italy, have been refused entry and returned on the same planes they arrived on.\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak\n- Nations tackle lockdown next steps.\n- Coronavirus cases rise in India as lockdown eases.\n- Putin’s approval rating plummets as Russian crisis deepens.\nAnd with the election nearing, the government set up separate polling stations for those who have recently returned from coronavirus hot spots.\nOne right-wing activist joked that colleagues should stand outside polling stations in Mr. Gantz’s strongholds, wearing face masks to deter voters.\nAt Ben Gurion Airport, just outside Tel Aviv, dueling forms of angst swirled through the departure and arrival halls on Sunday, with some passengers returning to vote and others worrying that they risked infection by leaving.\nFor Noga Perry, a 29-year-old translator returning from Athens, the two crises, political and epidemiological, had effectively converged.\n“We might vote for corona,” Ms. Perry said, laughing.\n“It would,” she whispered in jest, “be better than Bibi.”\nA young father rubbing his hands with sanitizing gel said he was feeling both sad to miss the vote and worried he was endangering his children by taking them skiing.\nAn older couple were relieved to return for the election, but feared they might have put their grandchildren at risk by visiting them in America.\nA South Korean cleaner said he feared his hotel might fire him if guests complained about the presence of an Asian staffer.\nAnd Ms. Perry wondered if she might be put in quarantine.\nNo one shook anyone’s hands.\n“Israelis love their panic, we love our drama,” said Danielle Kalev, Ms. Perry’s partner, who was relatively sanguine. “If I die, I die. What can I do except obsessively wash my hands with gel?”\nA rabbi ambled past, his face covered by a pale blue mask.\nRabbi Shimshon Eisenberger, 52, was just off the plane from Hong Kong, and had therefore been ordered to stay away from his synagogue and self-quarantine at home.\n“I’ll have to read my scrolls on my own,” he said, a little forlornly.\nThe quarantine rules felt slightly byzantine, he said with a sigh.\n“I can meet with 20 people in my apartment,” said Rabbi Eisenberger. “They can go out outside, but I can’t. It sounds weird, but those are the rules!”\nIn any case, his self-quarantine had effectively already been broken. A passer-by had approached with an angry question: If the rabbi really believed in God, why was he wearing a face mask?\nRabbi Eisenberger didn’t miss a beat.\n“God says you have to keep yourself healthy,” he said with a smile. “God wants you not to put yourself in jeopardy.”\nAt least he would still be able to cast his ballot, he said, thanks to the special polling stations for quarantined citizens.\n“I will not miss the opportunity,” Rabbi Eisenberger said. “I missed the last one.”\nAmid all the anxiety and the coming and going, a second rabbi was keeping his mind on the bigger picture. Shuffling past the arrivals board, Yehiel Maccabi pulled a maroon trolley, seemingly oblivious to the bustle around him.\nRabbi Maccabi was neither arriving nor departing. God sends him to pray every day at the synagogue in the arrivals hall, he said, “because there is no spirit in the people here.”\nHe squinted uncertainly at the mention of coronavirus, slowly repeating its syllables as if they were individual words.\n“Co-ro-na?” the rabbi asked. “What is corona?”"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/04/09/european-finance-ministers-ponder-coronabonds", "title": "Paying for it - European finance ministers ponder coronabonds | Europe", "text": "Editor’s note: The Economist is making some of its most important coverage of the covid-19 pandemic freely available to readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter.

For our coronavirus tracker and more coverage, see our hub\nIT IS “impossible to be more optimistic than [António] Costa,” Portugal’s president once said about his country’s irrepressible prime minister. Yet on March 26th Mr Costa’s bonhomie was nowhere to be seen. After EU leaders had held a fractious video-conference on the covid-19 crisis he stood before cameras, his face like thunder, to declare: “If we don’t respect one another…no one has understood anything about the EU.” Attacks by Wopke Hoekstra, the Dutch finance minister, on southern Europeans’ overspending were “disgusting” and “mean-spirited”. Things have not got much better since then.\nSome analysts forecast a slump of nearly 10% in euro-zone GDP this year. But though rich countries like Germany have marshalled huge domestic responses, solidarity has been lacking. Border checks were imposed and medical supplies hoarded. The EU has at least relaxed fiscal and state-aid constraints to give afflicted countries room to respond. And on March 18th, with bond yields in Italy and Spain creeping up, the European Central Bank announced a €750bn ($810bn) asset-purchase plan and relaxed its rules over what it can buy. Christine Lagarde, its president, said there were “no limits” to its commitment.\nThat was enough to calm the markets. But like her predecessor, Mario Draghi, whose “whatever it takes” intervention kept the euro together in 2012, Ms Lagarde wants governments to do more. Specifically, she urges the euro zone to consider issuing a jointly guaranteed, one-off “coronabond”. Nine governments, led by France, Italy and Spain, have made a similar plea.\nYet the euro zone remains divided along familiar lines. An all-night session of finance ministers on April 7th-8th failed to reach agreement after the Italians and Dutch squabbled over debt mutualisation and other matters. A smaller suite of measures may yet be signed off. These include an expansion of European Investment Bank private-sector loans, EU financial support for national wage-subsidy schemes, and perhaps credit lines from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the euro zone’s bail-out fund. But these amount to a “nothingburger”, says Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group consultancy.\nBy pitting frugal northerners, like the Germans, Dutch and Austrians, against supplicant southerners, the row recalls elements of the 2010-12 euro crisis. Yet the differences are at least as salient. During the euro crisis the ECB waited until 2012 to act decisively; this time Ms Lagarde moved quickly (after an early misstep), ensuring governments did not have to battle market and health-care meltdowns at the same time. Moreover, most coronabond proposals envisage a one-off issuance to pay for specific aims like health capacity or wage subsidies, rather than an ongoing commitment or the mutualisation of old debt. “You don’t win the debate with the same old arguments about Eurobonds, because this is a shock that hit everyone without being anyone’s fault,” says Lucas Guttenberg of the Jacques Delors Centre in Berlin.\nA more worrying difference is political. In Italy, which sits on a debt pile of over €2.5trn, Euroscepticism had emerged as a powerful force even before the corona crisis—channelled largely through Matteo Salvini, a former deputy prime minister who leads the hard-right Northern League. In early April one poll found that 53% of Italians were ready to leave the euro or EU. This has forced Giuseppe Conte, the non-partisan prime minister, to toughen his line, describing the ESM as “utterly inadequate”. Recalling the austerity forced on euro-zone wards like Greece by foreign creditors, many Italians fear that ESM loans will bring impossibly exacting conditions—even though Germany has promised leniency. The loans also stack up on national balance-sheets. As the Italian government negotiated on April 7th Mr Salvini appeared on television to denounce the “loan sharks” of Berlin and Brussels.\nSpain’s Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, is less hostile than Mr Conte to the ESM. But he has also abandoned Spain’s typical Euro-quietism, warning that ruling out coronabonds would risk the credibility of the EU in countries like his. During the euro crisis, in which Spain’s banks had to be bailed out by the ESM, Spaniards knew they were paying the price of their own irresponsibility in inflating a property bubble. This time they have simply been hit by bad luck. Rejection will spur Eurosceptic sentiment that populist parties on the left and right would be happy to harness.\nNeither Italy nor Spain is on the precipice. But the weakness of their fiscal positions—debt-to-GDP ratios of 136% and 97% respectively last year—is showing. Their responses to covid-19 have been more timid than Germany’s (see chart), despite the havoc it has wrought in their countries. More worryingly, growing debt may inhibit their ability to pay for recovery. The ECB is no panacea: its bond-buying could be indirectly undermined in May, when Germany’s constitutional court rules on the legality of its quantitative-easing programme; and anyway it cannot last forever. “At some point, markets will question Italy’s debts,” says Nicola Nobile at the Oxford Economics consultancy.\nThat calls for a “second line of defence”, says Grégory Claeys at Bruegel, a think-tank. Yet Germany continues to rule out coronabonds, and the Dutch appear even more immovable (although Mr Hoekstra eventually apologised for his tone). The sceptics’ old arguments about moral hazard and the risks of common borrowing without centralised supervision have been supplemented with new ones: a coronabond would take too long to establish, and institutions like the ESM and EIB involve some mutualisation anyway. And like their southern counterparts, northern governments must also deal with restive parliaments and troublemaking populists.\nCountless proposals aim to square the difference. There is talk of turning the EU’s small seven-year budget into a new “Marshall Plan”. The Dutch have proposed a small fund that would dispense no-strings aid. Perhaps most prominent is a plan of Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, to establish a temporary post-crisis rescue fund that would issue common bonds worth several billion euros, perhaps to be repaid by a European “solidarity tax”. Mr Le Maire carefully avoids the word “coronabond” while echoing Mr Sánchez’s apocalyptic talk about the risks of failure. But so far he has failed to win over Germany.\nEven Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, calls the corona crisis the biggest test the EU has ever faced. Yet her government’s diagnosis of the problem remains fundamentally at odds with much of the rest of the euro zone. The debate is not over, but Costa-style optimism is thin on the ground. “Whatever they do magic up is unlikely to meet the scale of the need,” says Mr Rahman. “Something may break.” ■\nDig deeper:\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus tracker and story hub\nThis article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline \"Paying for it\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/arts/television/trump-immigration-coronavirus-late-night.html", "title": "Some Bake During Lockdown .

That would be like Obama announcing the death of bin Laden on TikTok.”\n“But this is a big step for Trump because, remember, two-thirds of his wives have been immigrants. So closing the immigration system is Trump’s version of deleting Tinder.” — TREVOR NOAH\n“Now, if President Trump goes through with this immigration ban, it will be yet another policy he’s pushing through during the corona pandemic. In fact, his administration has already shut down visa applications, they’ve paused the refugee program, they’ve blocked migrants from seeking asylum, and during corona, Trump’s E.P.A. even decided to drastically cut enforcement of environmental regulations. So don’t forget, while you’re finally getting around to watching ‘Ozark’ and trying to bake bread for the first time, Donald Trump? He’s also using coronavirus as an opportunity to do all the things he always wanted to do. The only difference is, when quarantine is over and you throw away your bowl of yeast, Trump’s hobbies are gonna keep going for a very long time.” — TREVOR NOAH\n“Well, I don’t necessarily agree with it, but it is probably the safest thing for the immigrants. Because right now, America is basically a petri dish on the floor of a bus station men’s room.” — STEPHEN COLBERT\n“Well, even during the height of the 1918 flu pandemic, the United States allowed more than 110,000 immigrants to enter the country. So, Donald Trump is more xenophobic than Woodrow Wilson, and Wilson's campaign slogan was ‘Let’s punch an Italian.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT\nThe Punchiest Punchlines (Kim Jong-un Has a Heart Edition)\n“Last night the world was rocked by reports that Kim Jong-un, supreme leader and man who cut his own hair before quarantine, may be gravely ill after secretly undergoing heart surgery. This was major news. I didn’t know Kim Jong-un had a heart — crazy.” — TREVOR NOAH\n“He is reportedly in ‘grave danger’ after complications following a heart procedure, but because everything with him is secretive, no one knows for sure. One of the reasons they suspect he’s not well is because last week, he missed the most important holiday in North Korea, which is a birthday celebration for his late grandfather. And that’s especially alarming because, you know, he is not one to miss the chance to eat cake.” — JIMMY KIMMEL\n“A South Korean news site reported that Kim had heart surgery due to complications from ‘excessive smoking, obesity and overwork.’ See, that’s why our president doesn’t smoke and never works — he’s smart.” — JIMMY KIMMEL\n“If anything happens to Kim Jong-un, his sister will take over.

But some governments want to go further by harnessing their economic recovery plans to boost low-carbon industries. Their slogan is \"Build Back Better\", but can they succeed?\nI've just had a light bulb moment. The feisty little wren chirping loudly in the matted ivy outside my back door is telling us something important about global climate change.\nThat's because, intertwined with the melodious notes of a robin, I can actually hear its song clearly.\nNormally, both birds are muffled by the insistent rumble of traffic, but the din has been all but extinguished in the peace of lockdown.\nThe drop in traffic is a major contributor to the fall in planet-warming CO2 emissions we've witnessed globally.\n- Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB) (PDF, 10.4MB)\n- Covid recovery plan 'must tackle climate change'\n- Don't forget 'deeper emergency', says UN chief\n- Blue skies pushed Greenland 'into the red'\nBefore the Covid-19 crisis, we accepted the dominance of traffic noise as an inevitable consequence of city living.\nNow, we have sampled an alternative urban ambience.\nGovernments currently face a stark choice: bail out polluting businesses, using that as leverage to impose environmentally-minded reforms, or let them return to their carbon-intensive activities as an economic quick fix.\nBut many members of the public have little desire to return to the state of affairs before lockdown.\nIn a poll, a fifth of members of the motoring group the AA, said they would work more from home in future.\nThis has implications for the UK government's £28bn road-building programme which assumes that traffic will rise by 1% per year - a conjecture that now looks unlikely.\nThe stay-at-home trend will be offset somewhat by nervous public transport users shunning trains for fear of infection, and by long-distance commuters who might decide that if they only need to visit the office three days a week, they'll buy a home even further away.\nThe AA, which for years was seen as the voice of motorists, has asked the government to think again about its £28bn road expansion. Its president, Edmund King, has suggested the money would be better spent on improving broadband\nAnother likely winner from the crisis is the movement fighting to turn city streets over to pedestrians and cyclists.\nThis has already happened in places like Paris, which is rolling out 650km of \"corona cycle-ways\", and Milan, which has a programme to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists.\nThe determination to seize the moment for environmental change stretches further than the transport sector.\nThe UK is one of several nations looking to reboot its environmental strategy by calling in favours from private industry. After all, it was government which bailed out employers when the crunch came in March. The catchphrase is \"Build Back Better\".\nBut it would seem to face a direct challenge in the shape of China and the US. The economies of both these superpowers have been savaged by the effects of coronavirus.\nThey are desperate to get back to pre-virus levels of output, so their leaders may think the surest means of doing so is through tried and trusted climate warming fossil fuels.\nFor those seeking a greener way out of the Covid-19 slump, renewable energy will help, along with electric vehicle charging points and broadband.\nFrans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission, is on the same track. He is leading work on a Green Deal to make the EU's economy sustainable and says that not a single Euro should be spent propping up old, dirty industries.\nAll Covid-19 recovery investment should go towards commerce that either helps reduce carbon emissions or promotes digital business, he insists.\nBut some MEPs from parties on the right warn that the pandemic will have \"far-reaching\" economic and social consequences.\nThey insist the EU must scale back its pre-crisis climate ambitions.\nThat's led some governments, like Germany and the UK, to offer hand-outs to polluting industries without imposing green conditions.\nIn the UK, the issue is causing contortions among politicians torn between saving existing jobs and conserving the planet.\nMPs from the Liberal Democrats - thought of as one of the \"greenest\" UK parties - have joined other parliamentarians in demanding a conditional rescue for the airline industry.\nThey say that if ministers don't step in, tens of thousands of jobs will be lost.\nBut the firms should promise to off-set their emissions by, for example, planting trees.\nOff-setting is hugely contentious. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, argues: \"Any government bailout should focus on workers, not the industry itself.\n\"It should be conditional on the industry agreeing to shrink until - if ever - low-carbon technology is available - which isn't now.\"\nOne direction?\nThat begs a question: which industries should qualify for support? Should cash go exclusively to self-evidently green sectors like solar power - or to dirty firms trying to clean up?\nTake the fossil fuel firms that pay our pension dividends by drilling for the stuff that's over-heating the world.\nThe UK's oil and gas industry warns that 30,000 jobs could be lost because of the pandemic and the current low oil price.\nBut why would governments support a commodity that's fuelling the climate crisis, which is judged by the UN to be deeper than the Covid-19 crisis?\nPerhaps it's not that simple. Lord Stern, the former Treasury chief who's now a climate expert, told me each firm should be judged on its trajectory, not on its current state.\n\"The oil and gas industries are producing stuff you want to run down very quickly,\" he said. \"But you do see some companies - like BP and Shell - which are declaring they are moving in a direction where they want to be going zero carbon.\n\"So, you can't be indiscriminate or dogmatic. You have to look where the industry is going.\"\nAt least UK environmentalists are dealing with firms that agree on the need to tackle climate change.\nIn the US, some fossil fuel firms have been determined to pursue government bail-outs without strings binding them to a less polluting future.\nThe Democratic Party has a long-standing proposal for a \"Green New Deal\" to promote clean technology. But President Donald Trump has minimised the importance of climate change. He has promised to help struggling fossil fuel firms, although his efforts have not taken root in a major way.\nHe tweeted:\nThen there's China. In 2015, its leaders were persuaded by President Barack Obama to make major climate change commitments as part of the Paris climate agreement.\nSince then, China has suffered job losses and fuel shortages. Beijing has resorted to a quick fix for the economy by building coal-fired power plants.\nThe green think tank Global Energy Monitor says the number of plants China approved in the first three weeks of March 2020 - equivalent to 7,960 megawatts (MW) - was more than the number agreed in the whole of 2019 (6,310 MW).\n- A SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?\n- AVOIDING CONTACT: The rules on self-isolation and exercise\n- HOPE AND LOSS: Your coronavirus stories\n- LOOK-UP TOOL: Check cases in your area\n- TESTING: Can I get tested for coronavirus?\nThat doesn't take into account China's estimated $1 trillion investment in its \"Belt and Road\" initiative to build huge, carbon-intensive infrastructure projects across developing countries.\nUnless China and President Trump change their spots (or the Democratic candidate wins the US election), Europe's Build Back Better campaign won't be enough to protect the increasingly fragile climate, even if it does engineer a green recovery.\nAnd we have a lesson from history. Nick Robins from the London School of Economics (LSE) estimates that in the global financial crisis of 2008 just 16% of global stimulus plans were green - mainly because China invested massively in fossil fuel projects.\nHe tells me: \"If we have any hope of combating climate change, we must make absolutely sure we do it better this time.\"\nFollow Roger on Twitter.\n- What is climate change?\n- Climate-related words and phrases explained\n- How much warmer is your city?\n- What is your diet's carbon footprint?\n- Where we are in seven charts\nWhat questions do you have about the environment and Covid-19?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

The increase in their value, almost $2trn, exceeds the capitalisation of the entire German stockmarket. Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft are each worth more than $1trn each. So much for the consumer and regulatory “techlash” that was supposed to lay them low. But our cover leader argues that the threat to big tech firms has not gone away. The bull run reflects investors’ belief that the tech giants’ opportunities are far from exhausted; our special report points out that much of the economy is still to digitise. As upheaval disrupts the profitability of more non-tech firms and more workers’ livelihoods, the eventual backlash is likely to be bigger. Recession, when it strikes, will fuel new resentments, as the big tech firms—by far the biggest investors in corporate America—slash investment and squeeze suppliers.\nNot even mighty tech firms are immune to the economic effects of the coronavirus epidemic. On February 17th Apple warned investors that it would miss its revenue guidance for the quarter. Although daily numbers of confirmed new infections in China are falling, restrictions on movement remain strict. The virus is hurting both Apple’s manufacturing and its sales: many migrant workers have not returned to their jobs with its Chinese contractors, and China is the second-biggest market for iPhones. In fact, Apple’s troubles in China go beyond covid-19. Its manufacturing base in China is exposed to the Sino-American conflict over trade and technology. Sales of iPhones in China have been falling. And in a country where the state desires control of information and data, Appls may struggle to make up the shortfall by selling services.\nSome people think Frankfurt is a dull city. How can that be, when it boasts not merely one central bank, but two? Worryingly, the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank have fallen out. Before the euro was created, financial markets hung on the Buba’s every act. The ECB was created in its image and was at first heavily influenced by German economic doctrine. But since the euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis the Bundesbank’s influence has drained away and relations have soured. Its austere anti-inflationary philosophy has come into conflict with the ECB’s efforts to prop up growth by sending interest rates negative and buying bonds. German public opinion has turned against the ECB. (Germany’s sluggish growth—weaker than France’s—doesn’t help the national mood.) Our leaderargues that Christine Lagarde’s arrival at the ECB, and her promised review of monetary policy, provides an opportunity for a fresh start. The Bundesbank, after all, represents the zone’s biggest economy and remains a powerful intellectual and institutional force. Helpfully, the Bundesbank’s boss, Jens Weidmann, is already sounding less uncompromising.\nRodrigo Duterte was elected president of the Philippines in 2016 promising a war on drug dealers and other miscreants: “If they resist, kill them all.” He has been true to his word. The country’s human-rights commission estimates that 27,000 extra-judicial killings have taken place since he came to office. They have done nothing to dent Mr Duterte’s popularity; nor, among women, has his sexism; nor, in an overwhelmingly Catholic country, have his blasphemy or insults to the pope. Other aspects of his likely legacy (he is constitutionally bound to step down in 2022) are also troubling. Despite purporting to be an outsider, he has not brought the elite-uprooting change in Philippine politics that he promised. Indeed, his daughter is his successor as mayor of the southern city of Davao and potentially as president.\nJustin Trudeau was due to visit Barbados this week, to ask Caribbean leaders to support Canada’s bid for a seat on the UN Security Council. Instead the Canadian prime minister was in Ottawa, for talks on how to halt protests against a gas pipeline. The pipe, which is under construction, will go through land traditionally belonging to the Wet’suwet’en, a First Nations people. Demonstrators promising to “shut down Canada” have blocked roads and railways, some far from the pipeline itself. Mr Trudeau is in a bind, having promised to promote reconciliation with indigenous people, protect the environment—and promote economic growth."}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/how-does-the-coronavirus-death-rate-compare-with-flu-and-how-long-will-the-outbreak-last-tlpnwxg89", "title": "How does the coronavirus death rate compare with flu and how long will the outbreak last ?

Surrender some of your blood, and a lab will filter out the cells and keep only the amber-colored serum, with the antibodies to the virus still in there and active. This serum, further refined, is called “hyperimmune globulin.” All that remains is to infuse the serum into a healthy person (or, in much greater quantities, into a sick one). The antibodies won’t last forever, but they could last weeks or months, and either help a sick recipient heal or keep a healthy recipient from getting the virus at all.\nYesterday, a team at Johns Hopkins University led by Arturo Casadevall received FDA approval to try this technique. “This has a high probability of working, based on 100 years of experience in medicine,” he says. Indeed, it was used successfully to treat Ebola in 2014.\nThe approach does carry risks. Antibodies to a virus can make a viral infectionworsein some cases, such as with dengue fever. We don’t know if COVID-19 will react that way. (Most viruses do not.) Despite this, Casadevall says he has already had volunteers who wish to donate their antibodies or receive the serum from others. “This is real,” he says. “In eight weeks, we may have something that’s useful.” Takeda Pharmaceuticals, a Japanese company that has developed and sold hyperimmune globulin for other conditions since 2005, has already started collecting plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients, according to Julie Kim, an executive there. She says she hopes that Takeda’s product will become available in nine to 18 months.\nRead: America isn’t testing for the most alarming cases of coronavirus\nA catch: Each COVID-19 survivor can support the immunity of at most a few others, and to do so, the survivor will have to be bled at regular intervals, becoming a human blood bag. Casadevall suggests that the ratio of convalescent COVID-19 patients to serum recipients might be as low as 1 to 2, or as large as 1 to 10—10 immunized recipients for every survivor who opens his veins. The next eight weeks will be devoted, among other things, to figuring out how many people a single blood bag can support. They’ll also have to figure out which convalescent patients are best endowed with antibodies, and wring as much blood plasma out of them as possible.\nAnd if the project works, it will create ethical dilemmas. Who will be among the lucky 10 for every survivor? Will you be able to donate your antibodies to your loved ones? They’reyourantibodies after all—ones you worked hard to produce—and perhaps you should have the right to choose where they should go. In free countries, we are reluctant to take away citizens’ precious bodily fluids, bleeding one another dry, without permission.\nBut something feels wrong about a world in which the rich can immunize themselves by buying the blood of the poor as they stagger out of the hospital. As a matter of public health, people in need should have dibs on those antibodies. Put health-care workers first in line, Casadevall suggests, and those who care for sick relatives at home. One option would be to nationalize COVID-19 antibodies: You can keep them in your own body and enjoy them all you like, but once they get sucked out of your body, they belong to humanity and might even get pooled into a massive stockpile of blood plasma, on tap for those who need it most. Another option, less restrictive, would be to treat the plasma like kidneys. You can donate your kidney to anyone but sell it to no one. This approach, it must be said, leaves us with a shortfall of 21,000 kidneys every year, and 13 people die every day on the wait list. Let survivors sell their antibodies, and more antibodies will be available."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/us/ftc-mlm-coronavirus-claims.html", "title": "F . T . C .

The commission and the Food and Drug Administration have previously sent warning letters about unapproved health products related to the coronavirus.\nThere currently are no products that are scientifically proven to treat or prevent the virus, according to the F.D.A.\nIn the recent letters, the trade commission targeted so-called multilevel marketers, which distribute products or services through networks of salespeople who are not employees of the company and who do not receive a salary or wage. It warned the companies that false or misleading earnings claims are a violation of federal law.\n“M.L.M.s and other companies that distribute their products through networks of distributors are responsible for the product and earnings claims those distributors are making,” Andrew Smith, the director of the commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement announcing the warning letters.\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S.\n- President Trump pushes to reopen the economy as new reports illustrate fragmented federal response.\n- A deep recession and ballooning unemployment in Europe darken the global economic picture.\n- Comparing recent deaths to historical figures hints at the real toll in each U.S. state.\n“During this health and economic crisis, we are on the lookout for false income claims for work-at-home opportunities, in addition to spurious health claims that products can treat or prevent Covid-19,” he said.\nThe letters note videos and social media posts by the companies or their distributors in which the F.T.C. said they made unsubstantiated claims about health benefits and potential income.\nOne example highlighted by the agency, a video from Pruvit Ventures, which sells ketone supplements, included the statement: “I can tell you that there’s thousands of people that are out of work right now.

The current emergency ward is planned to house COVID-19 patients only, and a supplementary emergency room for non-COVID-19 patients will be set up on the ground floor of the haematology and oncology clinic,\" Eelmäe said.\nChanges in the organization of work were developed by the hospital's crisis committee for minimizing the possible spread of COVID-19 among inpatients and increase preparedness should the number of patients suddenly surge.\nHead of the crisis management team Joel Starkopf said Tartu University Hospital has already introduced movement restrictions and social distancing measures by postponing outpatient treatment and planned activities.\n\"In order to restrict workers' and patients' movement between wards, the crisis management team has issued guidelines for reorganizing work by department. A fourth intensive care ward has been created along with two wards for infectious diseases for COVID-19 patients. For patient protection purposes, the capacity of the emergency room has likewise been increased,\" Starkopf said.\nThe second emergency room for non-COVID-19 patients can be accessed through a mobile triage unit set up for a preliminary assessment of the patient's medical needs. If a patient has recently developed either a cough, sore throat of breathing difficulties and a fever of at least 37.8 degrees Celsius, they will be sent to the first ward for COVID-19 patients.\nPatients requiring hospital treatment may increase next week.\nSpeaking on ETV's \"Ringvaade\" Starkopf said there may be an increase next week in the number of patients with COVID-19 needing to be treated in hospital.\nHe said there are currently four people who have tested positive for coronavirus in Tartu University Hospital, but the hospital is preparing to receive more patients.\n\"Prediction is a thankless task, but forecasting models say that the need for hospitalization will increase from the beginning of next week, at the end of next week and beyond,\" he said.\nStarkopf said it is too early to say when the number of new patients will start to decline. \"We are waiting two weeks from the emergency situation and then we may be able to assess the situation in the country more accurately.

Now is the time for statesmanship, accommodation and inclusivity.”\nThe rivalry and political turmoil have impeded each step toward talks between the government and the Taliban — negotiations that were supposed to come next under a peace deal that Washington signed with the insurgents in February.\nThe deal, which has been touted as Afghanistan’s best chance yet of ending its relentless wars, calls for the eventual withdrawal of all 13,000 U.S. soldiers from Afghanistan in exchange for guarantees from the Taliban that they would fight other militant groups, including the Islamic State extremist group.\nThe Security Council “called on the political leadership of Afghanistan to put aside their differences and put the interest of the country first.”\nCouncil members “commended the presentation of a negotiating team for the upcoming intra-Afghan negotiations, including several women,” and expressed hope that those negotiations would start “without delay, bearing in mind the challenge the COVID-19 situation poses.”\nDespite last week’s announcement of the negotiating team by Ghani, the Taliban has continued attacks, most recently on Monday in the north and south killing at least 11 Afghan soldiers and policemen, according to the country’s Defense Ministry and a provincial official.\nThe Security Council “condemned the recent heinous terrorist attacks in Afghanistan and stressed the importance of sustained efforts to continue to reduce the violence and to ensure that the territory of Afghanistan will not be used by Al-Qaida, (Islamic State) or other international terrorist groups to threaten or attack any other country.”\nSecretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an immediate global cease-fire on March 23 so the world can respond to COVID-19.\nGermany’s deputy ambassador Jurgen Schulz said the continuing Taliban attacks against security forces go against the February agreement with the United States, don’t build confidence for a peace process, and must stop.\n“As the corona crisis has also spread to Afghanistan and we can’t even estimate its true extent there yet, an end to violence is even more urgent,“ Schulz said.\n“Afghan refugees are already leaving Iran without the necessary medical facilities to treat them in western Afghanistan,“ he warned, referring to the high number of COVID-19 cases in Iran. “The same is likely to happen with Afghan refugees from Pakistan. This is bound to exacerbate the health crisis.“\nFrance’s deputy U.N. ambassador Anne Gueguen said it’s crucial to continue support for the Afghan people who have “been plagued by war, terrorism, poverty, and now a pandemic,” and the most crucial support needed now is humanitarian aid especially to deal with “the risk of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.”"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/opinion/coronavirus-trump.html", "title": "Opinion | With Coronavirus , Paranoid Politics Goes Viral", "text": "We still don’t know how much damage Covid-19 — the coronavirus disease — will do, but it’s reasonable to be very concerned. After all, it appears to be highly transmissible, and it is probably a lot more lethal than ordinary flu.\nBut not to worry, say right-wing pundits and news organizations: It’s all a hoax, a conspiracy by the liberal media to make Donald Trump look bad. Administration officials and Trump himself have echoed their claims.\nThese claims are, of course, crazy. Among other things, Covid-19 is a global phenomenon, with major outbreaks ranging from South Korea to Italy. Are the South Korean and Italian media also part of a conspiracy to get Trump?\nThis craziness was, however, entirely predictable to anyone who has been following right-wing politics. It’s just the latest battle in a long-running war on truth, on the very idea that there exists an inconvenient objective reality.\nIn the case of Covid-19 the usual suspects were, in part, engaged in projection. After all, they themselves engaged in a concerted effort to politically weaponize the 2014 Ebola outbreak against Barack Obama, whose response was in reality smart and effective. By the way, in the aftermath of that outbreak the Obama administration put in place measures to deal with future pandemics — all of which Trump scrapped.\nBut as I said, virus denial is just the latest battle in a long-term war on truth.\nRemember, conservatives have spent decades denying the reality of climate change, insisting that it’s a gigantic hoax perpetrated by a vast international scientific conspiracy. And as the signs of climate catastrophe multiply, from wildfires in Australia to drought in California, climate denial has only strengthened its grip on the G.O.P. On the eve of the 2018 midterms, a survey found 73 percent of Republican senators denying the scientific consensus that man-made climate change is happening.\nOr consider how many on the right reacted after their dire predictions of hyperinflation under Obama failed to pan out — not by admitting that they were wrong, but by insisting that the numbers were being cooked. And I’m not talking about fringe figures, I’m talking about people conservatives consider leading intellectuals.\nNow, this kind of conspiracy theorizing isn’t exclusively the province of the right. You can, for example, see some similar tendencies in Bernie Sanders’s team. It was dismaying to find a senior Sanders adviser declaring that all those disagreeing with proposals for a wealth tax — which, by the way, I support — “are the types of groups and academics that are funded by the powers that be, the establishment, the billionaire class.”\nThe thing is, while corruption by big money does happen — it’s the main force keeping zombie ideas alive — it doesn’t lie behind every policy dispute. Sometimes serious analysts just disagree. And it’s worrying that some of the Sanders people can’t tell the difference.\nBut the right is where the paranoid style goes hand in hand with real power, and can do real damage. Indeed, it can be deadly.\nThis is obvious when it comes to climate change, where conspiracy-theory-fueled denial plays a big role in blocking action, and hence poses an existential threat to civilization.\nAt first, it wasn’t clear whether right-wing paranoia was also hampering the response to Covid-19. But recent reporting makes it clear that one major reason the U.S. has lagged far behind other countries in testing for the coronavirus — an essential step in containing its spread — was that Trump didn’t want to believe that there was a crisis. After all, recognizing that we face a serious problem might hurt his beloved stock market.\nThis desire to minimize the danger to the market distorted the whole government response to the outbreak. Some have drawn parallels to the run-up to the Iraq war, when the Bush administration’s evident desire to be given a rationale for war skewed intelligence toward seeing nonexistent weapons of mass destruction.\nIn today’s case, analysis was skewed toward not seeing a threat — and the skew was enabled, in part, by claims that all the evidence that there was, indeed, a threat was a hoax perpetrated by the liberal news media.\nAnd there is little evidence, even now, that the Trump administration is taking the reality of Covid-19 seriously. While the administration is finally asking for additional funds to fight the disease, the sums it has suggested seem grotesquely inadequate.\nTrump allies are already denouncing his critics for “politicizing” the outbreak; Donald Trump Jr. has accused Democrats of wanting to see millions die. But it was actually Trump who politicized the virus, by downplaying the danger.\nIt’s true that Democrats are criticizing Trump’s actions, suggesting that his refusal to accept responsibility for, well, anything is putting America at risk. Last time I checked, however, criticizing America’s leaders was still legitimate.\nBut that’s the thing about political paranoia: You see even the most normal criticism as part of a sinister conspiracy. And the fact that this kind of paranoia has infected our ruling party is scarier than any virus.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-treatment-trial-artifical-intelligence-pittsburgh-international-244aeb3d-9bbf-4088-bb88-d2a56ec9b1ea.html", "title": "International coronavirus treatment trial uses AI to speed results", "text": "International coronavirus treatment trial uses AI to speed results\nHydroxychloroquine is one of the drugs that will be included in the trial.

About 12.5% will receive placebo at the launch and the rest will be randomly selected to multiple interventions with one or more antibiotics, antivirals, steroids, and medicines that regulate the immune system, including the drug hydroxychloroquine.\n- The platform, based on an existing one called REMAP-CAP, is integrated with UPMC's electronic health records and the data collected via a worldwide machine-learning system that continuously determines what combination of therapies is performing best.\n- As more data is collected, more patients will be steered toward the therapies doing well, Angus said.\n- The adaptive trial format, published Thursday in the journal Annals of the American Thoracic Society, can allow new treatments to be rolled into the trial.\n\"This idea came to us after the H1N1 [epidemic], when everyone scrambled to do traditional trials\" but by the time those were established, the outbreak had moved on, Angus said. \"We asked, how we can do this better.\"\nThe big picture: There are more than 400 listed clinical trials for treatments, therapies and vaccines related to COVID-19.\n- These include trials led by the NIH, which is also testing hydroxychloroquine and the antiviral drug remdesivir.\n- Others plan to evaluate HIV drug Kaletra, Mesoblast's stem cell treatment, experimental antibody treatments like SAB-301, monoclonal antibody treatments like REGN3048 and REGN3051, amongst others.\nGo deeper: Podcast: Hydroxychloroquine questions"}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2020/02/photos-life-in-the-time-of-covid-19/606706/", "title": "Photos : Life in the Time of Coronavirus", "text": "Photos: Life in the Time of Coronavirus\n- Alan Taylor\n- February 18, 2020\n- 30 Photos\n- In Focus\nThe ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 (formerly called the 2019 novel coronavirus) in China and some neighboring countries has led to unprecedented efforts to isolate, control, and halt the spread of the virus that has now infected more than 73,400 people, and caused at least 1,875 deaths since December of 2019.

In fact, the spike protein is not active until it is cut in two. The virus takes advantage of another human enzyme—such as furin or the inelegantly named TMPRSS2—which can unwittingly come along and activate the spike protein. Several candidate drugs are meant to prevent these enzymes from unknowingly doing the virus’s work. One possible mechanism for the much-hyped hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug Trump is fixated on, may be inhibiting this spike-activation process.\nOnce the spike protein is activated, SARS-CoV-2 fuses itself with the membrane of the host cell. It injects its genome, and it’s in.\nStop the virus from replicating\nTo a human cell, a naked SARS-CoV-2 genome looks like a specific type of RNA, a molecule that normally functions as instructions for making new proteins. So like a soldier who has gotten new orders, the human cell dutifully begins churning out viral proteins to make more viruses.\nReplication is a relatively complicated step, which makes it a ripe target for antivirals. “There’s many, many proteins involved … there’s many potential targets,” says Melanie Ott, a virologist at the Gladstone Institutes and UCSF. For example, remdesivir, an experimental antiviral that is in clinical trials for COVID-19, targets the viral protein that copies the RNA, so the genome-copying step goes awry. Other viral proteins called proteases are necessary to free individual viral proteins that are linked together in one long strand, so they can go off and help the virus replicate as well. And still other proteins might help remodel the internal membranes of the human cell, creating bubbles of membrane that get turned into little virus factories. “The replication machinery sits on these membranes, and then it just starts making tons of viral RNA over and over and over again,” Matthew Frieman, a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told me.\nRead: COVID-19 vaccines are coming, but they’re not what you think\nIn addition to proteins that help it replicate and the spike proteins that make up a portion of the virus’s outer capsule, SARS-CoV-2 has a set of relatively mysterious “accessory proteins” that are unique to this virus. Figuring out what these accessory proteins are doing, Frieman said, could help scientists figure out other ways SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the human cell. These accessory proteins might allow the virus to evade the human cell’s natural antiviral defense in some way—another potential target for a drug. “If you can target that process,” Frieman said, “you can help the cell inhibit the virus.”\nStop the immune system from going haywire\nAntivirals are likely to work best early in an infection, when the virus has not infected many cells nor made too many copies of itself yet. “When you give antivirals too late, the risk is the immune component has already taken over,” Ott says. In COVID-19 specifically, patients who become critically and fatally ill seem to experience what’s known as a cytokine storm, in which the disease sets off an indiscriminate and runaway immune response. Perversely, cytokine storms can also further damage the lungs, sometimes permanently, by allowing fluid to build up in the tissue, says Stephen Gottschalk, an immunologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Another way to treat COVID-19, then, is by treating the immune response, rather than the virus itself."}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/29/russians-trafficking-illegal-coronavirus-ventilators-detained-in-armed-standoff-reports-a70141", "title": "Russians Trafficking Illegal Coronavirus Ventilators Detained in Armed Standoff : Reports", "text": "A group suspected of attempting to sell 100 counterfeit ventilators used to treat coronavirus patients have been detained after an armed confrontation outside Moscow, news outlets reported Wednesday.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has strained Russia's healthcare system as infections have soared, with officials and healthcare workers pointing to widespread shortages in equipment such as ventilators.

Manhattan, with nearly three times as many people, had about 10,860 cases.\nHealth officials have not released data on the race or ethnicity of the people who are sick, and officials from the Department of City Planning cautioned against drawing broad conclusions based on ZIP codes, which is how the city has released limited information about positive cases.\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York\n- The subway’s nightly closings have begun.\n- Plastic shields and homemade Lysol: How a N.Y. grocery has persevered.\n- A judge ordered New York to hold its Democratic presidential primary.\nYet health care workers and community leaders say it is indisputable that the pandemic has disproportionately affected the Hispanic day laborers, restaurant workers and cleaners who make up the largest share of the population in an area often celebrated as one of the most diverse places on earth. Latinos comprise 34 percent of the deaths in New York City, the largest share for any racial or ethnic group, according to data released by state officials on Wednesday.\nThe neighborhoods also have large communities of Indian, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Filipino and Nepali people, and a score of other ethnicities that have been devastated by the pandemic.\nThe city-run Elmhurst Hospital Center was one of the earliest and hardest-hit by the virus. Dozens of Covid-19 patients have clogged hallways as they wait for beds, terrified, alone and often unable to communicate in English.\n“We’re the epicenter of the epicenter,” said Councilman Daniel Dromm, who represents Elmhurst and Jackson Heights. He became emotional as he took stock of losses that included five friends and more than two dozen constituents. “This has shaken the whole neighborhood,” he said.\nIn their daily toll of the fallen, city and state health officials have not disclosed where exactly deaths are occurring. But community leaders and organizers have kept their own tallies, providing a window into the virus’s disproportionate impact on immigrant communities. Some of the more prominent names in Queens include the Rev. Antonio Checo, a pastor at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Jackson Heights; Lorena Borjas, a transgender activist; and Kamal Ahmed, the president of the Bangladesh Society.\nThe New York Taxi Workers Alliance said 28 drivers had died — the vast majority of them immigrants living in Queens — and Make the Road New York, an advocacy organization that serves the area’s working-class Latinos, said eight of its members in Queens had died. “A tragedy is unfolding,” said the co-director, Javier H. Valdés.\nThe crisis has transformed the neighborhood. Roosevelt Avenue, the vital commercial artery that normally bustles with taquerias, arepa stands, threading salons and shops selling newspapers in dozens of languages, has all but shut down. The eerie silence is intermittently broken by sirens and the clattering of trains on elevated tracks.\nA handful of street vendors have returned, but now they sell masks and dress in Tyvek suits. With churches and mosques closed, families of the dead can mourn only at home.\nThe chockablock density that defines this part of Queens may have also have been its undoing. Doctors and community leaders say poverty, notoriously overcrowded homes and government inaction left residents especially vulnerable to the virus.\n“I don’t think the city communicated the level of danger,” said Claudia Zamora, the interim deputy director of New Immigrant Community Empowerment, an advocacy group and worker center in Jackson Heights.\nIn early March, she said, city health officials sent out fliers with hand-washing tips, but not the outreach workers and multilingual posters that might have conveyed the looming peril.\nThe sick now include laborers like Ángel, 39, a construction worker from Ecuador who asked that only his first name be used because of his immigration status.\nLike many, he said he worked at a Manhattan construction site until he fell ill. He said he was turned away from Elmhurst Hospital because his symptoms were not deemed life-threatening and had been suffering in the apartment in Corona he shares with three other workers. “I don’t have anyone to help me,” he said.\nCity officials rejected the suggestion that they left the city’s immigrant neighborhoods to fend for themselves. The Department of Health, officials said, created coronavirus fact sheets in 15 languages. Officials mounted multilingual public service campaigns in subways and on television, and have provided continuous updates to the ethnic media including on the need for social distancing.\nRonny Barzola, a 28-year-old Ecuadorean-American from nearby Kew Gardens who works for the food delivery service Caviar, is one of the lucky few to still have a job. He slathers his hands with sanitizer throughout the day but worries about his mother and sister, both of whom are sick at home but have been unable to get tested. “It’s impossible to isolate when everyone is sharing the same apartment,” he said.\nMr. Subba, a longtime driver for services including Uber and Via, had stopped driving last month after picking up a sick passenger, said a cousin, Munindra Nembang, who added that Mr. Subba, 49, had been diabetic. His wife and two of his children were also infected.\nHundreds of other Nepali immigrants are sick, too, he said, including another Uber driver, who died on Wednesday. “Some are in I.C.U., some are on ventilator, some are in the queue,” Mr. Nembang said. “We feel very sad.”\nMany residents struggled with poor health long before the coronavirus arrived. Dr. Dave Chokshi, chief population health officer for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, said rates of diabetes, high blood pressure and other chronic conditions in central Queens were considerably higher than the city average.\nCompounding the crisis, many residents lack health insurance and depend on public hospitals for even routine procedures, said Diana Ramírez Barón, a doctor at Grameen VidaSana, a clinic in Jackson Heights for undocumented women.\n“They tell them to stay home and call your physician,” she said, referring to public health guidelines for people believed to have the coronavirus. “But they don’t have a physician. They get scared and they go to the E.R.”\nThe New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has begun a special Covid-19 relief campaign. All proceeds will go to nonprofits that provide assistance to those facing economic hardship. Make a tax-deductible donation via GoFundMe. Donate\nPatricia Rivera, a Mexican immigrant, said she had kept her distance from her mother’s household in East Elmhurst as the virus ripped through its seven members last month, infecting all but one. But then her mother, who was struggling to breathe, needed to be taken to the hospital.\nMs. Rivera, 38, took her to Flushing Hospital Medical Center, but came home worried she would infect her own crowded household, which includes a 70-year-old uncle. She found some N95 respirator masks given to a son on a construction job, and handed them out to her family.\n“Fear is what we’re all feeling,” said Ms. Rivera, who is working for a laundromat, carrying laundry to and from quarantined homes.\nFor many, the fear of getting sick is heightened by the prospect of becoming homeless. Johana Marin, 33, a waitress from Jackson Heights, said she spent several days in the hospital.\n“I thought I was going to die and never see my family in Colombia again,” she said.\nWhen she was discharged, she said, the woman who rented her a room refused to let her stay. Ms. Marin found refuge in the apartment of an aunt who she said was now pressing her to leave.\nMr. Dromm, the councilman, said such stories were increasingly common and he urged the city to convert empty hotel rooms into temporary housing for those discharged from the hospital or patients with mild symptoms who were at risk of infecting others. City officials say they are working to address the problem.\nThe challenges of dealing with the dead are becoming clear, as officials discuss digging temporary graves and families call on consulates to help them repatriate the deceased to their home countries.\nIn the meantime, the needs of the living keep growing. Thousands have lost jobs, and the undocumented have so far been excluded from federal government aid.\nAt a food pantry run in nearby Flushing by the nonprofit organization La Jornada, the vast majority of visitors were, until recently, single mothers. Now two-thirds are men trying to feed their families, said the director, Pedro Rodríguez, who worried the number of jobless residents would soon prove overwhelming. “A tsunami is coming,” he said.\nDespite the growing despair, many are finding ways to help others. Mexican grandmothers share recipes for traditional herbal fever remedies, Pakistani drivers deliver home-cooked meals and Nepali volunteers — including Mr. Nembang, the cousin of the driver who died — are distributing protective gear to those who must keep working.\nFor thousands of people, however, life has been reduced to the dimensions of tiny rented rooms.\nMs. Begum, the former nanny from Bangladesh, said she was riddled with fear. She spends her days compulsively cleaning the apartment’s bathroom and steering clear of her ailing roommates. The landlord has been demanding April rent and threatening eviction.\nFor succor, Ms. Begum turns to the Quran she keeps beside her bed. “I am praying every day,” she said. “Praying that the coronavirus leaves America.”\nSomini Sengupta, Paula Moura, Jo Corona and Ryan Christopher Jones contributed reporting."}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/quarantine-ends-for-germanys-coronavirus-evacuees/a-52397242", "title": "Quarantine ends for Germany ′ s coronavirus evacuees | News | DW", "text": "The German military flew back over 100 people from Wuhan, the city at the center of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.

There are more than 50,000 people living in Narva, but only one infected person been discovered so far.\nIn mobile sample tents established ten days ago, a little over a hundred corona samples have been taken from Narva citizens, although the capability is many times higher, ETV current affairs show \"Aktuaalne kaamera\" reported.\nOn two days, the tent was even closed, due to the lack of people wanting to be tested. The municipality has blamed family doctors, who they say haven´t directed people to take the test. Family doctors confirm that there few patients with the required symptoms, and there´s no reason to test a healthy patient.\nThe family doctors society board head, Karmen Joller, explained the situation by the fact that when the coronavirus first arrived in Estonia (in late February-ed.), people already started to distance themselves from each other, and washing their hands more. This had also had an effect on the incidence of common flu strains.\n\"Actually, the good old flu has almost retreated. There are a few other diseases as well, I also see it in my practice. Maybe this is one of the reasons. As far as I can understand, the family doctors know very well which kind of patients should be directed [to testing],\" Joller said.\nLanguage should not be an issue in the largely Russian-speaking town, either, Joller said.\n\"We sent the instructions both in Estonian and Russian, and I think that is not related to language problems, it is rather related to the fact that people are healthier at the moment,\" Joller said.\nJoller made her comments on \"Aktuaalne kaamera\" on Tuesday evening, before a single COVID-19 coronavirus case had been reported. However, the first infected person was diagnosed on Tuesday, March 31.\n\"This was expected, because the number of analyses has increased and it would be naive to believe that Narva will stay untouched by it,\" the mayor of Narva Aleksei Jevgrafov said after the first diagnosis.\n--\nDownload the ERR News app for Android and iOS now and never miss an update!\nEditor: Roberta Vaino"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/coronavirus-false-rumours-cost-lives-researchers", "title": "False rumours on coronavirus could cost lives , say researchers", "text": "False rumours on coronavirus could cost lives, say researchers\nStudy finds people who believe online scare stories are more likely to ignore health advice\n- Coronavirus – latest updates\n- London patient went to hospital in Uber\nMisinformation and fake news on social media during infectious disease outbreaks, including the current novel coronavirus epidemic, can cost lives, according to researchers.\nAbout 40% of people in the UK believe at least one conspiracy theory of some kind, say the researchers from East Anglia University. The figures are even higher in the United States and other parts of the world.\nTheir study, supported by Public Health England, looked at the impact of scare stories, rumours and false information about diseases such as norovirus, flu and monkeypox, shared on sites such as Twitter. It found that people who believed them were less likely to behave in a way that would protect themselves and others, such as washing their hands frequently and keeping away from other people if they have any symptoms.\nProf Paul Hunter, who is an expert on the new coronavirus infection, now called Covid-19, and Dr Julii Brainard, who are from UEA’s Norwich Medical School, said efforts to disseminate correct information across social media and correct the false stories could save lives.\nHunter said: “Fake news is manufactured with no respect for accuracy, and is often based on conspiracy theories.\n“When it comes to Covid-19, there has been a lot of speculation, misinformation and fake news circulating on the internet – about how the virus originated, what causes it and how it is spread.\n“Misinformation means that bad advice can circulate very quickly – and it can change human behaviour to take greater risks.\n“We have already seen how the rise of the anti-vax movement has created a surge in measles cases around the world.\n“People in west Africa affected by the Ebola outbreak were more likely to practise unsafe burial practices if they believed misinformation. And here in the UK, 14% of parents have reported sending their child to school with symptoms of contagious chickenpox – violating school policies and official quarantine advice.\n“Examples of risky behaviour during infectious disease outbreaks include not washing hands, sharing food with ill people, not disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces, and failing to self-isolate.\n“Worryingly, people are more likely to share bad advice on social media than good advice from trusted sources such as the NHS, Public Health England or the World Health Organization.”\nThe researchers looked at the effect of two strategies for combating the fake news. One was to reduce the amount of misinformation on social media. The other was to educate people to recognise false information when they saw it – something they call “immunising” people against it.\nBoth tactics had some success, said Brainard. “But while we used very sophisticated simulation models, it is important to remember that this is not an observational study based on real behaviour,” she said.\n“The efficacy of implementing such strategies to fight fake news needs to be tested in real-world settings, with costs and benefits ideally compared with real-world disease reduction.”"}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/dont-even-think-about-leaving-new-york-city/608884/", "title": "Dont Even Think About Leaving New York City", "text": "There are already pockets of disease on Long Island, and fever spikes in the Catskills,and empty stores in Jersey shore towns that have long put up with our summering bullshit. To paraphrase theNew York Post, Nantucket thinks NYC can suck it.\nAnd though I am dreaming, hallucinating almost, of what it would be like to have a yard for the dog and the kids while we wait out the pandemic, rural communities just aren’t built for anybody’s dream quarantine. Proactive governments recognized this early on. A friend of mine in Norway, the restaurateur Nud Dudhia, had been staying with his family in their super-hygge mountain cabin. But in mid-March Norway’s government ordered everyone back to their primary residence, so that any potential health-care burden would land where the population actually lived.\nIn the U.S., unbelievably, whether to leave is still up to you, as is where to go. If you fled for the hills the moment you read about Dr. Li Wenliang’s death in February, then kudos. I’m jealous of your paranoia, and perhaps you didn’t endanger anyone. But if you left this week, or are planning on leaving, you are nakedly prioritizing your comfort and peace of mind over the physical health of others. Don’t start in on Donald Trump, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, or any of those faraway self-dealers unless you start by doing what you can do to be part of the solution. Stay home.\nI borrowed some of this moral clarity from an aunt in Madrid. She had watched with horror and fascination as politicians in Italy (about as far ahead of Spain along the coronavirus curve as Spain is of the United States) leaked news about a planned quarantine so that, instead of being contained, the virus scattered around the country on the wings of hundreds of thousands of individual decisions. That was on my aunt’s mind as the cordon started closing in on her city. She and her partner thought about fleeing to the village of Adahuesca, but, as she put it, “there was a chance that we’d just kill all the old people there.” They stayed put.\nThe restrictions in Madrid make New York’s stay-at-home guidelines look like an invitation to bacchanalia (seriously, why are our playgrounds still open?). In Madrid today, you can’t walk a dog with more than one person. Police have the discretion under Penal Code 556 of fining you if you are smoking or otherwise loitering on the street. Spaniards are lovely people and frequently also insolent scofflaws, so some started taking a couple of cans and a carrot or two from their own pantry and walking them around the city, to pretend they had been out shopping. Now police demand that you show a grocery-store receipt.\nIf you are nervous about staying in New York, and shopping solo, and surviving, this video that everyone is sharing from the Weill Cornell ICU doc David Price should reassure you that you can do this.

It requires the involvement, I kid you not, of 40 people. If that’s not a barrier to care, I don’t know what is,” the doctor said.\nUnderstanding the testing situation requires walking through hypotheticals. If an American with a state or city’s first community case of COVID-19 walked into an emergency room—short of breath, exhausted, and perhaps coughing up blood—would he or she get tested? It depends on the state, the county, sometimes even the individual hospital.\nThe person would probably not get tested in New Hampshire, which had the strictest guidelines among the dozens of states we asked to share basic information about their current testing criteria. If someone has not had contact with a COVID-19 case, has not traveled from a country where the CDC or World Health Organization says the coronavirus is in community spread, and is not sick enough to be hospitalized, then a flow chart published by the state recommends “no testing; usual care.” (After publication, New Hampshire said it had updated its rules. Under the new guidance, a doctor could test such a person if they were exposed to large numbers of people or were judged to have a “risk of exposure to COVID-19.”)\nRead: What you need to know about the coronavirus\nMost other states publish criteria only for how to prioritize tests. Hawaii, Idaho, and Vermont hew to something like the basic CDC criteria, asking doctors to focus on patient symptoms, travel history, and known exposure. North Carolina, among the most lenient, will allow doctors to test a symptomatic patient if the person has failed a rapid flu test. Some states—such as Missouri, Wisconsin, and Colorado—allow for testing a hospitalized patient if the person is in severe respiratory distress and has no other diagnosis.\nSome states admit they have to be more stringent with tests than the CDC recommends. In Missouri, a spokeswoman told me that the state public-health lab had to reserve its “finite number of tests … for those in greatest need.” The state has testing supplies for only about 1,000 samples, she said, and additional testing kits and supplies had been back-ordered from the CDC for two weeks.\nSome states, such as Illinois, Colorado, and Washington, prioritize testing when officials or doctors suspect there might be a cluster of cases, such as in a school or nursing home.\nMost state guidelines do not apply to tests conducted by private laboratory firms that do routine medical testing, such as Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp. Those firms say they can test 5,000 people a day, combined, but they take three to four days to deliver results, compared with 24 hours for a state public-health or on-site hospital lab test.\nWhat about a doctor or nurse who has COVID-19 symptoms and wants to get tested? Again, it varies by state. Washington, the site of the country’s largest confirmed outbreak, says it will test health-care workers as well as people in other “public-safety professions,” such as police officers, firefighters, and EMS. Colorado allows symptomatic health-care workers to get tested, even if they don’t know whether they have had contact with a COVID-19 patient. But Illinois says that health-care workers can get tested only if they have met a patient with a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19."}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2020/03/07/japan-may-have-to-cancel-the-olympics", "title": "Banyan - Japan may have to cancel the Olympics | Asia", "text": "IF BANYAN HAD to choose one country in which to ride out a pandemic, it would surely be Japan. Early 19th-century woodblock prints of bathing testify to Japan’s old and admirable cult of cleanliness. Modern Japanese have for years been quick to don a face mask at the first sniffle, out of consideration for others. And the population responds swiftly to public messaging.\nHygiene measures advocated against covid-19 since mid-January emphasise frequent washing of hands. This has surely helped slow the spread of the coronavirus, especially given that of Japan’s 1,035 covid-19 cases and 12 deaths, most are associated with a cruise ship held for weeks off Yokohoma. One striking and positive side-effect is already apparent: unlike in Europe or America, doctors report sharp falls in cases of ordinary flu, not only compared with previous years but also with the first part of the winter. Given that 3,300 deaths were attributed to flu in Japan in 2018, the good hygiene inculcated in recent months may well have saved far more lives than covid-19 has claimed.\nFor all that, social strains have shown in recent days. In Tokyo scuffles have broken out in queues for facemasks outside pharmacies. Panic-buying of toilet paper has left shelves bare. A photograph of toilet rolls in a public lavatory chained to their dispenser with a bicycle lock has done the rounds. While hardly “Lord of the Flies”, it is all highly unusual in such a well-behaved country.\nBlame a squall of doubt over the government of the usually assertive prime minister, Abe Shinzo. His problems seem, precisely, to have begun with the cruise ship, the Diamond Princess. When cases of covid-19, contracted overseas, became clear among the 3,700 people aboard, measures to isolate them failed badly. The vessel was, as one passenger put it, a floating petri dish, as the number of infected soared to over 700, with seven deaths. Extraordinarily, crew were eventually let ashore from the infected vessel, and Japanese passengers allowed to return home on public transport, with no further quarantine measures.\nWhen it comes to bumbling crisis management, Japan has form. After the Kobe earthquake in 1995, yakuza (gangsters) set up soup kitchens, so slow was government help to arrive. Bureaucratic disarray ruled in the Diamond Princess’s handling, too. European ambassadors with nationals aboard complained they did not know who in the government to call. Fans wondered whether Mr Abe, invisible during the crisis, had lost his touch. His hitherto unassailable poll ratings fell sharply.\nTo contain the damage to his reputation as well as the coronavirus, on February 27th Mr Abe took the initiative, telling all schools to close until April. Preparing for the worst, he rushed through legislation this week allowing a state of emergency to be declared. And he unveiled an emergency spending package.\nThe assertive Abe, then, is back. So much so that questions are growing about what expert advice, if any, he drew on for his schools decision. New social stresses will surely emerge, not least for working mothers (it never seems to be fathers) who must now drum up weeks of day-time childcare. “The government does not grasp what it’s like to raise children,” one mother complains.\nThe government claims that Japan will return to normal in April. That seems implausible. A state visit by China’s president, Xi Jinping, which was supposed to put the two countries’ listing relationship on an even keel, has already been postponed. There is little political cost to Mr Abe—after all, nationalists who backed his rise to power had been grumbling about his hosting the Chinese dictator.\nMuch more rides on the Olympic Games in Tokyo this summer. Mr Abe intends them to foster the patriotism whose absence among ordinary Japanese he laments. He wants the games to make Japan seem open, global and even multicultural. And, though vastly over budget, they are to crown the prime minister’s seven-year rule.\nTo cancel the games would generate not only disappointment among ordinary Japanese but anger at the wasted expense they have already had to bear. But a pandemic would take the decision out of his hands—not least, says Nakano Koichi of Sophia University, because the Olympic village would be “a cruise ship on land”. Bet on a postponement of the games at the very least, and on a long delay before the prime minister’s popularity shines again.\nThis article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline \"Flu jabs\""}, {"url": "https://time.com/5801534/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-cornavirus/", "title": "Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson Test Positive for COVID - 19", "text": "Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, have both tested positive for the coronavirus, the actor said in a statement Wednesday.\nHanks said on Twitter that while he and Wilson were in Australia \"felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches.\" He added that Wilson had chills.\n\"To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus, and we were found to be positive,\" he said.\npic.twitter.com/pgybgIYJdG - Tom Hanks (@tomhanks) March 12, 2020\nThe 63-year-old actor said that they will be “tested, observed and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires.” The couple is in in isolation at Gold Coast University Hospital in the Australian state of Queensland, according to Australia's Seven News.\nHanks is in Australia working on an untitled film about Elvis Presley directed by Baz Luhrmann for Warner Bros.

In a Wednesday evening address to the nation, President Donald Trump announced a temporary suspension of all travel between the U.S. and Europe, except for the United Kingdom, in a bid to stop the spread of the virus."}, {"url": "https://time.com/5802661/coronavirus-cancelations-workers/", "title": "How COVID - 19 Impacts Transportation Workers Across The U . S . ", "text": "Travel to — and throughout — the United States has rapidly dropped in recent days, driven by concerns about the spread of the novel coronavirus. On March 11, President Donald Trump announced a month-long ban on most non-U.S. citizens traveling from Europe in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus — and on March 14 said the ban will extend to the United Kingdom and Ireland — although the move has been criticized as ineffective at stopping a virus that is already in the U.S.\nTrump's orders follow a widely-reported trend of people across and the U.S. (and across the world) canceling or curtailing travel plans in an attempt to limit their risk of contracting COVID-19. This practice of self-isolation, known as social distancing, has already had an impact on many major forms of mass transportation across the U.S. and internationally; here's how's how the travel industry is responding — across flights, trains, cruise ships and more — and what it means for the industry's workforce.\nHow is the airline industry affected by coronavirus?\nThe airline industry has already been heavily impacted. According to OAG, a global travel data provider, the number of scheduled flights is globally down by 10% compared to the second week of March in 2019.\nRelated\nMany U.S. and European companies have been hit particularly hard by President Trump's travel ban on non-U.S. citizens who have visited Europe's Schengen Area, a collection of 26 countries that do not restrict travel amongst each other including Italy, Spain and France. Per OAG, the ban will affect passengers arriving on nearly 7,000 flights over the next month.\nA spokesperson for Airlines for America, a trade association and lobbying group that represents major U.S. airlines, told TIME in a statement on March 13 that, \"We respect President Trump’s decision to take action to prevent the spread of the virus as our top priority is – and always will be – the safety and well-being of all passengers and crew. However, the government-imposed travel restrictions have triggered rapid and severe damage to the airline industry.\"\nRead more: Exclusive: Here's How Fast the Coronavirus Could Infect Over 1 Million Americans\nU.S. airlines directly employ 750,000 workers; the industry as a whole supports 10 million jobs. \"The economic impact on U.S. airlines, their employees, travelers and the shipping public is staggering,\" the spokesperson continues. New flight bookings for the next 90 days are down by 65-75%.\nThe flight attendant's union the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA-CWA) told TIME on March 13 that they've seen a general reduction in the availability of flight hours but have not yet been made aware of any involuntary furloughs. However, flight attendants are generally paid by the hour, and that drop could be costly.\nSara Nelson, the International President of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA — which represents 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines — explains to TIME that 80% of flight attendants in the industry are organized, and that their contracts provide pay protections that help mitigate schedule loss. However, most flight attendants work more hours than such pay protections account for, and depend on the income from those extra hours.\nNelson also told TIME that the AFA-CWA has worked with airlines to secure contractual pay protection in the current months' schedule and has worked with management of multiple airlines to determine how much voluntary, unpaid leave they'll offer. Nelson says that flight attendants will still have their health insurance while on leave, \"which is critically important as we're facing this pandemic.\" Flight attendants on leave will also maintain their seniority.\nThe Air Line Pilots Association, a union that represents over 63,000 pilots, tweeted on March 11, \"ALPA’s Air Safety Organization is closely monitoring the 2019 novel #coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and will continue to meet regularly and provide timely information to our pilot groups as the situation progresses.\"\nDelta Airlines\nThe airline most affected by the the U.S.-Schengen area travel ban will be Delta Airlines, which was scheduled to fly 17% of flights affected by Trump's ban, per OAG. On March 13, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a memo to all Delta employees world-wide that the company would reduce an unprecedented 40% of its overall capacity over the next few months — parking up to 300 aircrafts. This will be the largest reduction in the company's history, including 9/11.\nOn March 14, the airline announced it would suspend multiple routes to South America, Europe and Asia and would continue to operate one flight daily between Atlanta and Amsterdam, Atlanta and Paris and Atlanta and London. It will operate one flight daily between New York and London.\nRelated\nIn his March 13 memo Bastian also said Delta would immediately offer voluntary short-term unpaid leave and institute a company-wide hiring freeze. It also will reportedly reduce its use of consultants and contractors.\n\"Through this unprecedented and evolving business environment in the COVID-19 pandemic, Delta’s values remain stronger than ever. This includes taking care of our people and letting our values lead. To that end, we are offering employees the voluntary option to take a 30, 60 or 90-day unpaid leave while retaining full benefits and enhanced travel privileges including confirmed flights,\" a Delta spokesperson told TIME on March 14.\nThe AFA-CWA’s Nelson told TIME on March 13 that Delta is the only major airline whose flight attendants are not unionized, and she’s concerned what this could mean for workers.\nUnited Airlines\nUnited Airlines is the second-most affected by the ban; it was scheduled to operate 14% of affected flights, per OAG. The airline was also one of the first to take drastic action because of the spread of the virus. On March 4, United announced it would reportedly offer voluntary, unpaid leave for U.S. based employees, would institute a hiring freeze and postpone salary increases.\nOn March 10, United announced that it would cut 20 percent of its flights indefinitely until demand increases, according to The Washington Post. Its CEO and president will also reportedly forgo their base salaries through June. United President Scott Kirby said that airline's domestic net books are down 70% as of Tuesday, per ABC News.\nThe airline will continue to fly its regular schedule from Europe to the U.S. through March 20 to assist customers departing Europe, and afterwards will cut back on its routes while still flying daily to Dublin, Zurich, Brussels, Paris, Amsterdam and multiple flights to Frankfurt, Munich and London.\n\"We are reviewing our flight and crew schedules to comply with the administration’s travel restrictions,\" United told TIME in a statement sent on March 12. \"As always, we will continue to provide our customers and employees with the very latest information as it develops.\"\nRead more: What We Can Learn From Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong About Handling Coronavirus\nAmerican Airlines\nAmerican Airlines is the fourth most affected by the U.S.-Schengen ban, per OAG, and announced on March 12 that it would suspend multiple routes to Europe and South America through May After the President announced that the European travel ban would expand to include the United Kingdom and Ireland, American Airlines announced that the airline would reduce its international capacity by 75% from March 16 to May 6. It also announced route suspensions to popular locations like London, New York, Sydney, and Tokyo; all flights to Asia and Australia are suspended, as are most flights to Europe and many to South America.\nIn response to these suspensions, Lori Bassani, the national president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), which represents 28,000 flight attendants at American Airlines, said in a statement on Sunday that American has offered short-term leave options for flight attendants and the union was working to receive longer-term leave options. She added that “On the health front, we have demanded all protective measures for our Flight Attendants be provided on every flight—focused first on international flights but now on flights everywhere. We have also addressed internal protocols and the sick policy for crew members who may be exposed and/or quarantined.”\nWhen asked for comment, American Airlines referred TIME to a letter sent to all its team members on March 12, which announced that the company would suspend all hiring and leadership moves, postpone pay increases, and offer extended unpaid, voluntary leaves of absence. The letter also said that American Airlines is extending a two-week paid sick policy for all team members who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or are quarantined.\nRelated\nMany other U.S. and European airline companies have been hurt by the threat of COVID-19. The German company Lufthansa is the third most affected by the U.S.-Schengen Area travel ban, for example. But even before Trump's announcement, the airline had already canceled 23,000 flights between March 29 and April 24.\n\"Our primary goal is to keep as many of our employees on board as possible,\" a Lufthansa spokesperson told TIME in an emailed statement. \"The extremely urgent decisions on reduced working hours are an important milestone in this regard... The Lufthansa Group has launched an extensive savings program. This includes an immediate hiring freeze, as well as cost reductions in personnel, material and project costs. We are using all available means to secure our liquidity.\"\nOn March 16, Norwegian Air also announced it would suspend over 85% of its flights and implement temporary layoffs of up to 90% of their employees. Norwegian did not immediately respond to TIME's request for comment.\nKeep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here.\nHow is the rail industry affected?\nOn March 16, Amtrak announced its Northeast Corridor — which runs between Boston and Virginia — would operate 40% of its typical weekday schedule. The Keystone Service in Pennsylvania will be suspended as of March 18 and all Pennsylvania trains are suspended as of March 19.\nThe Amtrak Hartford Line, the Valley Flyer line, the New York State Service and the Amtrak Downeaster line will be operating on a reduced schedule starting March 17. The Cascades service and the Winter Park Express lines have canceled their service.\nJohn Feltz, director of the Transport Workers Union Train Division, told TIME on March 13 there's a possibility that onboard service workers on Amtrak he represents — such as cafe car workers — may have to prepare for a \"furlough or a layoff situation.\" He says the the union is \"still trying to work that out with Amtrak right now\" and \"they are cooperating and they are working hand-in-hand.\"\nFeltz says that, if furloughed, workers would be able to collect unemployment under the Railroad Retirement Board, but their health insurance would be only last three months from their time they first left work.\nAmtrak told TIME on March 13 that they are \"working closely with the unions right now as we adjust our schedules as a result of reduced demand that has cut hundreds of millions of dollars from our revenue estimates.\"\n\"We will soon be rolling out a voluntary unpaid leave program where non-essential employees can volunteer to take unpaid leave in order to contribute to reducing our expenses,\" the spokesperson continued. She added they've taken other cost cutting measures \"as we work hard to offset the revenue loss while minimizing the impact on our employees.\" These measures include: ending all non-safety critical hiring; cutting discretionary travel, cutting professional fees, cutting consultant spending, cutting advertising spending, and cutting deferred non-priority capital projects.\nRead more: President Trump Says He Was Tested for Coronavirus\nAnthony Simon, general chairman of the transportation division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation workers, who represents workers on the Long Island Railroad, writes TIME in an email that they have \"been in constant contact with management and local officials. We have the full support of our international Union as well, and our work is secure moving forward as decisions and conditions are constantly changing.\"\n\"Our first priority is for everyone’s safety and to prepare for whatever is necessary to restore normal. While there have been no threats to cut service as of yet, we will be prepared for whatever comes our way,\" he writes.\nHow is the cruise industry affected?\nThe spread of COVID-19 has been devastating for the cruise industry. In a tweet on March 13, President Donald Trump announced that four major cruise lines — Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC — have agreed to not sail from U.S. ports for thirty days. This comes after ports around the world have begun to temporarily ban cruise ship arrivals out of fear about the spread of coronavirus.\nRelated\nRead more: Why Are So Many Politicians Testing Positive With COVID-19?\nCruise Lines International Association, a trade organization that includes over 50 cruise lines, announced on March 13 that all CLIA ocean-going cruise lines will be temporarily suspending cruise ship operations from U.S. ports of call for 30 days.\nAt my request, effective midnight tonight, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry – it will be kept that way! - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2020\nMultiple cruise ships have suffered high profile outbreaks of the virus. The Diamond Princess was quarantined for weeks off the coast of Japan and at least 700 people on board ended up contracting coronavirus. Another cruise ship, the Grand Princess, was prevented from docking off the coast of California for days out concerns about spreading the virus, and 21 people on board ended up testing positive by the time they disembarked in Oakland on March 9.\nPrincess Cruises\nOn March 12, Princess Cruises — which is owned by Carnival Corp. — announced it was suspending all its global operations through early May, meaning 18 ships will cancel trips that were scheduled to begin between March 12 and May 10.\nWhen asked what would happen to the employees scheduled to work these voyages, a spokesperson for Princess Cruises told TIME on March 12, \"Shoreside employees may temporarily take on new duties to support this change and the refund process. Most shipboard teammates will return home until service resumes in 60 days.\"\n\"Our teammates are our Princess family and we are committed to the care of our team. This is an unprecedented action in the history of our company, so we do not know how everything will play out. We ask for understanding as we work through the specifics regarding compensation and other details,\" the spokesperson continued.\nOn March 13, Carnival Corp. announced four more cruise lines would suspend their activity for a month: Carnival Cruise Line, Cunard North America, Holland America Line and Seabourn. Carnival Corp. did not immediately respond to TIME's request for comment about what would happen to its workers.\nDisney Cruises\nOn March 13, Disney Cruise Lines announced that it would suspend all new departures of Disney cruise ships beginning March 14 through the end of the month. \"While we know this decision may be disappointing, the health and wellbeing of our guests is of the greatest importance,\" Disney Cruise Line said in a statement.\n\"We are equally committed to the wellbeing of our incredible crew members who live and work aboard our ships and on Castaway Cay. During the suspended operations, Disney Cruise Line will continue to compensate our Crew Members and shoreside Cast Members,\" the statement continued.\nRead more: 'Only a Matter of Time.' At This Washington State Immigrant Detention Center, Attorneys Believe a Coronavirus Outbreak Is Inevitable\nViking Cruises\nViking Cruises also announced that it would suspend all ocean and river cruises until May 1.\nViking directed TIME's request for comment to a message sent to all employees on March 11: \"Viking’s guests and our crew always come first; we stand by you. The Company is financially strong, and we have experience in handling adversity. We have no plans to reduce our crew levels as they currently are and will use the next weeks to improve our procedures to handle future challenges presented with the new coronavirus.”\nHow is the shipping and delivery industry affected?\nIn late February, Shippers Transport Express alerted 145 drivers who work at the port of Los Angeles that they would be reducing hours beginning on Feb. 28, because of the decreased volumes of cargo moving through the port.\nRelated\nRon Herrera, the director of the Teamsters Union Port Division of the Western Region, told TIME on March 13 that roughly 30% of those drivers have been allowed to keep driving. He says the decreased hours are driven by the low volume of cargo coming from Asia. ABC 7 reports that Phillip Sanfield, spokesperson for the Port of LA, said that they saw a roughly 25% decline in volume in February 2020 compared to February 2019.\nA spokesperson for Shippers Transport Express told TIME in an email on March 13, \"We have in good faith worked to alert our workers to the reduced volume situation facing our industry as a result of the [coronavirus].\"\n\"We've informed [drivers] that we will be providing hours as volume arrives and we have more work. Hopefully, volume returns to normal shortly and we will have volume and hours for all our drivers. This will be done on a seniority basis, as hours materialize, which is the Teamster's process,\" he continued.\nRead more: Why Can’t I Get Tested for Coronavirus?\nOne of those workers is 35-year-old Wendy Cruz, who has driven for Shippers Transport Express for four years. She told TIME on March 13 that she's \"definitely\" worried about job security going forward. \"We don't know what's going to happen,\" she explains. \"And I recently just purchased a home.\"\nHerrera told TIME on March 13 that the Teamsters Union anticipates more layoffs because of low manufacturing rates in China. \"I don't think we've seen the bottom of this yet,\" he says. As NBC News reports, some economists say the coronavirus could have a bigger effect on U.S.-China trade than the Trump-era trade war did.\nHow is the ride-sharing industry affected?\nUber and Lyft have also taken a hit from the spread of COVID-19.\nUber has announced that if any driver or delivery person contracts coronavirus or is asked to self-isolate the company will provide financial assistance for up to 14 days. Uber has also announced that it's working to provide drivers with disinfectants to help clean their cars. Similarly, Lyft has announced that it plans to deliver cleaning supplies to its drivers and will \"provide funds to drivers\" with COVID-19 or in quarantine \"based on the rides they provided on the Lyft platform over the last four weeks.\"\nBut many U.S.-based Uber and Lyft drivers have expressed frustration that their companies have no done enough to protect them from the virus or from severe economic losses.\nSteve Gregg, who has been driving for Uber and Lyft in California's Bay Area for a little over three years, told TIME on March 13 that he's \"not in a position\" where he can stop driving. Even though he says his fear over the coronavirus has caused him to have mild panic attacks, he's had to keep driving because he depends on the income to support his children. Gregg adds that the two-weeks compensation he would receive if he got sick would be \"a little too late.\"\nYash — an Uber and Lyft driver whose full name TIME is withholding to protect his job — says his income went down last week by 30%. He adds that as his income has gone down, his costs have gone up; he now takes his car to get washed every day.\n“We are at the front line of this epidemic. On a daily basis we deal with 20-30 people,\" he says. He says he's been suffering from insomnia since the crisis began, but he can't stop driving because he can't afford to.\nWhen asked for comment on March 12 about the impact the spread of the virus has had on drivers, Uber directed TIME to a speech the company's CEO Dara Khosrowshahi gave at Morgan Stanley last week, where he said, \"As far as the impact to date, first of all, we are completely focused on the operational side of the business, making sure that our riders are safe, our drivers are safe, they understand what are best practices to make sure you stay safe. Our employees are taken care of. Our partners are taken care of.\"\nWhen asked for comment on March 12 about the virus' impact on drivers, a Lyft spokesperson told TIME in a statement, \"We are monitoring the coronavirus situation closely, and taking action based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control. Our focus is on keeping our riders, drivers and team members safe. We have an internal task force dedicated solely to this issue, and are prepared to take action as needed.\"\nResponding to the concerns raised by the drivers TIME spoke with, a spokesperson for Uber said in a March 14 in a statement, “The mounting fear and uncertainty caused by the coronavirus is being felt by everyone around the world. We know it’s especially concerning for people who drive and deliver with Uber. In these difficult times, their well-being is at the top of our minds, and we have a dedicated team working around the clock to support them the very best we can.”\nLyft did not return a March 13 request for comment on the drivers' comments.\nPlease send any tips, leads, and stories to virus@time.com."}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/04/07/covid-19-pandemic-the-race-for-a-vaccine-and-cure-for-the-deadliest-viral-outbreak-in-a-ce", "title": "Racing for a cure : where are we with COVID - 19 vaccines and treatments ? ", "text": "SARS-Corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV2), cause of COVID-19, is the infection that the whole world is now trying to beat. The respiratory disease has arguably caused the most serious global crisis since World War II, infecting over one million people and causing more than 70,000 deaths.\nAs the world grapples with the pandemic, the scientific community is on the hunt for effective, scalable treatments, while at the same time developing a safe and tested vaccine.\nThe race to find a vaccine\nIt usually takes 10 to 15 years to develop a vaccine.\n\"For Ebola, we did it in five years, I know we can accelerate that,\" says Seth Berkley, the CEO of the global health partnership GAVI (Global Alliance For Vaccines and Immunization).\nHighly unusually, human trials with an experimental COVID-19 vaccine have already begun. Seattle resident Jennifer Haller became the first person to receive one on March 16 2020, at her hometown's Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute.\nShe was one of a group of volunteers that were involved in testing on humans just weeks into the fast-spreading epidemic.\nThis experimental vaccine, officially named mRNA-1273, was developed by the National Institutes of Health and Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Moderna Inc. There’s no risk of the volunteers becoming infected, because the shots do not contain the coronavirus itself.\nThe World Health Organization says there are over 40 potential vaccines. There are reportedly as many as one hundred undergoing development, although only a handful are as yet being clinically tested.\nThe promise of RNA vaccines\nA promising way of combating COVID-19 appears to be with a vaccine that manipulates a part of the virus known as RNA.\n\"The RNA molecule carries all the coronavirus' genetic information,\" explains Marie-Paule Kieny, Director of Research at the French Public Health organisation INSERM. \"The RNA can be synthesised on a large scale in the laboratory. This is why it's being used in this first vaccine, for which there are clinical trials underway.\n\"Other vaccines are based on viral DNA, or on other viruses which have been weakened, which don't produce disease and in which we can include the genetic information of the COVID virus.\"\nThere are over thirty companies and academic institutions worldwide trying different approaches to find the silver bullet that will beat COVID-19.\nThe Trump-Curevac controversy\nIn Germany, the biopharmaceutical company Curevac is using the so-called messenger molecule - mRNA - in a vaccine that it believes will be ready for clinical tests in June.\nAs Curevac spokesperson Thorsten Schüller explains:\n“We use the mRNA to instruct the body to produce its own vaccine, so we only put information into the body. It's a totally new approach in medicine.”\nCurevac made the front pages when it was reported that US President Donald Trump had offered the company one billion dollars to secure the vaccine exclusively for the United States. But Schüller insists the company never received any such offer from the White House or any other US institution:\n\"Our aim is to develop a vaccine for all people, all over the world. Then the health practitioners have to decide how to distribute such a vaccine.”\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, has since offered CureVac 80 million euros in research funding to help develop a vaccine.\nControversial treatments\nWhile the world waits for a vaccine, potentially millions of patients will need treatment. Researchers and doctors have started to test sometimes controversial combinations of existing drugs to treat those infected, but so far there is no cure.\nIn France, Marseille's University Hospital Institute has offered to test and treat people exhibiting COVID-19-like symptoms. Didier Raoult, head of the institute's infectious diseases department believes that a cheap and easily produced malaria drug can treat COVID-19. Raoult announced promising results on a small sample of patients in late February using Chloroquine and its related compound Hydroxy Chloroquine.\nBut Marie-Paule Kieny is one of many in the scientific community that are sceptical:\n\"I know that there's been a lot of talk, in France and elsewhere, about claims by certain researchers who say that this drug works, that this drug will save the world. But unfortunately, for the moment, the proof that this hydroxychloroquine medication is effective is extremely weak, or even non-existent.”\nAcross the border in Italy, doctors at Milan’s San Raffaele Hospital are using the same combination of drugs suggested by Professor Raoult.\nFabio Ciceri, San Raffaele's Deputy Director explains there are no nationally-approved protocols and each hospital can choose its strategy:\n\"AIFA, the Italian Medicines Agency, has instructed us on a reasoned use of the drugs. So the drugs we are using are existing drugs, repurposed to be used against the coronavirus, based on laboratory results that demonstrate their potential to be effective\".\nUnheeded warnings\nIt's felt by some that the current pandemic could have been avoided, or at least very much better prepared for.\nAfter all, there have been previous coronavirus outbreaks, beginning with SARS in 2003.\nIn 2015, the software developer and philanthropist Bill Gates gave a Ted Talk in which, three years after the MERS outbreak, he warned that the world was not ready for a future pandemic.\n“If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades it’s most likely to be a highly infectious virus, rather than a war. Not missiles, but microbes.\n\"Part of the reason for this is that while we have invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents, we have actually invested very little in the system to stop an epidemic. We are not ready for the next epidemic.”\nThe warnings of Gates and others went largely unheeded. Some prominent epidemiologists blame a system more focused on commercial opportunities than public health needs.\nStuart Blume, Professor of Science and Technology at the University of Amsterdam agrees that despite the attention the issue has received globally, practical organisation and preparation was definitely lacking:\n\"All the countries for the last 10 years have been busy with epidemic preparedness scenarios. But they're still all over the place (in terms of) trying to find what to do.”\nIldefonso Hernández Aguado, Professor of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, at Alicante's Miguel Hernández University says the worldwide financial crisis which began in 2008 influenced this lack of preparedness:\n“Previously, drills were carried out with a certain frequency to get ready for these events. This came to a halt because of the post-crisis years of austerity.\n\"Budget cuts were requested and money was saved in sectors that were thought to be inessential. What’s happening could have been foreseen, but policies and decision-making went the other way”."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/8ff67ac633adbdf425f2451173da028c", "title": "Japan to let off last healthy cruise travelers , isolate rest", "text": "Japan to let off last healthy cruise travelers, isolate rest\nTOKYO (AP) — Japan’s health minister said the last cruise ship passengers who tested negative for a new virus will leave the Diamond Princess on Friday after a much-criticized quarantine of the vessel ended.\nThe ship docked at a Yokohama port has the most COVID-19 cases outside of China, with 634 confirmed by late Thursday.

If you’re at risk of a severe case, or if you’re having trouble breathing, the experts say you should seek medical attention. But if you’re just managing things at home, should you take Advil to bring down your temperature?\nThe advantages of “riding out” a fever instead of taking painkillers such as ibuprofen, the active ingredient in Advil, are the subject of a long-standing debate among medical professionals. Some doctors believe fever is beneficial to the body’s natural immune response; others aren’t so sure, and instead say that patients should just focus on making themselves comfortable.\nThat debate was rekindled when Oliver Verán, the French health minister, tweeted on Saturday that ibuprofen could worsen COVID-19. “The taking of anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, cortisone …) could be a factor in aggravating the infection,” he wrote. “In case of fever, take paracetamol. If you are already taking anti-inflammatory drugs, or if you are in doubt, ask your doctor’s advice.”\nHis tweet went viral, prompting many to wonder whether they should, in fact, avoid ibuprofen if they come down with COVID-19.

(Emily Sherwin, DW Moscow)\nLondon\nLike almost everybody in London, I live in an incoming flight path. Six major airports surround the metropolis, so there is virtually nowhere to escape the sounds of the engines. Usually from 4 a.m. to late at night in a two to three-minute interval. For the past week or so, those intervals have become wider each day. There are still planes landing at Heathrow, but a lot fewer than before. Other airports are deserted.\nAnd this mirrors the atmosphere in the city: The most popular tourist hotspots including Buckingham Palace, Tate Modern and Tower Bridge are eerily empty.\nChanging of the guard — in every sense\nInitially there was complete denial: Something like that could not happen in the UK, many people told me. This was when Prime Minister Boris Johnson's only advice was to wash hands for 20 seconds while singing \"Happy Birthday\" twice — a godsend for the soap industry, as staff in a soap store told me.\nIt seemed like the UK government's plan was not to flatten the curve but to get people sick: Keep calm, get COVID-19 and carry on.\nAfter the phase of denial came the panic after Johnson announced his so-called herd immunity plan. The mood has now shifted and Johnson is following the lead of his European counterparts: schools are to be shut nationwide from Friday.\nRead more: Coronavirus in the UK: NHS faces perfect healthcare storm\nThat is when shoppers hit the grocery stores, online delivery slots became booked out for weeks — now in most places canned food, pasta, grains, frozen food, diapers, wipes, disinfectants,toilette paper and certainly hand soaps have become scarce. I saw two older ladies crying in the supermarket the other day because they couldn't carry as much as the others. (Charlotte Potts, DW London)\nNigeria\nI could never have imagined people in Europe asking me to send them hand sanitizers from Nigeria. But nothing is normal these days. In West Africa, a region where people already face numerous challenges, people are watching in disbelief as others fight over toilet paper in parts of the world considered much better off.\nSo far only a small number of cases have been confirmed across the region. \"Are we just lucky?\" people ask or \"simply much better prepared with lessons learnt from the Ebola crisis?\" As I stroll through the supermarket, I see shelves full of imported products, especially from the US: cornflakes, ketchup, peanut butter and chocolates.\nPeople here seem more concerned about how the economic impact will trickle down to them. With about half of Nigeria's population of roughly 200 million living in extreme poverty, most people will not have money to stock up on food. And those who could, aren't buying more than usual yet. \"We do not panic as long as the virus is not in our face,\" says Ugonna Ajoku, one of the customers I meet in the supermarket.\nBut poverty and violence mean that millions of Nigerians millions lack access to the very basics, such as clean water — let alone access to soap.\nPoverty-stricken Nigerians are more concerned about the economic effects of the coronavirus\nAs we drive through Lagos towards our DW studio, we turn the radio on. Corona does not top the broadcast, nor is it the main headline in newspapers. People worry more about inter-ethnic and inter-religious violence spiraling out of control in the north of the country. Corona still seems far away.\nPeople here are in the phase Europe was in around late February; jokes about Corona have largely dominated conversations. One of the \"jokes\" I overhear these days among Nigerians is about turning the tide: \"Corona will not come to us. But if Europeans want to come, we will welcome them as refugees, we will not send them away.\" (Fanny Fascar, DW Lagos)\nCoronavirus has wrecked global markets in a way comparable to the global financial crisis.

Most of them are linked to neighbouring Iran, where an outbreak has killed 107 people and infected 3,513 others.\nThere is concern that Iraq's health system will not be able to cope with a major outbreak, after years of war, UN sanctions, neglect and corruption.\nA member of the Iraqi parliament's health committee has said the country's \"hospitals and healthcare facilities are fully equipped to deal with the outbreak\".\nWhat do I need to know about the coronavirus?\n- LATEST: Live coverage of developments\n- EASY STEPS: What can I do?\n- A SIMPLE GUIDE: What are the symptoms?\n- MAPS AND CHARTS: Visual guide to the outbreak\n- VIDEO: The 20-second hand wash\nBut the WHO said last month that Iraq's medical infrastructure had \"some significant gaps\" that it was working to address. Doctors have reported shortages in supplies, equipment and staff.\nThere are also more than 4.1 million people, almost half of them children, in need of humanitarian assistance in Iraq.\nSome 1.4 million civilians are internally displaced, and there are hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighbouring countries.\nThe UN has warned that many are living in camps where conditions and outdated infrastructure mean that Covid-19 could potentially spread easily.\nIraq's border with Iran has been closed, and Iraqi citizens returning from Iran are required to undergo a 14-day mandatory quarantine.\nIn an attempt to halt the spread of the disease inside Iraq, the authorities have placed restrictions on gatherings at public sites and ordered the closures of schools, universities, cinemas and cafes. Several government ministries, departments and committees have also suspended work.\nOn Thursday, the Shia religious authorities announced that they had cancelled the weekly Friday prayers in the southern holy city of Karbala.\nA statement issued by the Imam Hussein Shrine Administration on Thursday said the decision was taken in response to the \"current health situation\" and a call by Karbala's health department to \"refrain from holding large gatherings these days\".\nThe shrines in Karbala and in the neighbouring city of Najaf - where an Iranian theology student was Iraq's first case of Covid-19 - attract millions of Shia pilgrims from across the world every year. The Iranian city in Qom, which is also a major Shia pilgrimage site, was where Iran's Covid-19 outbreak first emerged.\nThis month there are three significant Shia holy days that would normally attract large numbers of pilgrims from Iran.\nSaudi Arabia said on Wednesday that it had suspended the lesser Muslim pilgrimage, or Umra, for citizens and residents as a precaution. Last week, it barred foreigners from performing pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina.\nCases linked to Iran have also been reported by Saudi Arabia, as well as Afghanistan, Canada, Lebanon, Pakistan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\nThe UAE, which is a major hub for international air travel, told citizens and foreign residents on Thursday to \"avoid travel\" anywhere abroad."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/16/observer-view-on-coronavirus", "title": "The Observer view on coronavirus | Observer editorial", "text": "The Observer view on coronavirus\nThere are still many unknowns about this outbreak but it must be a warning on how to prepare for future pandemics\nThe news that coronavirus Covid-19, which has spread across much of China over the past two months, has now claimed its first life in Europe might be seen as an alarming development.\nUntil now, deaths from respiratory illnesses that have been triggered by the virus have been confined to the Far East; more than 1,500 deaths have occurred in China plus three others in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan. Now the virus has killed someone much nearer to home, in France, suggesting that a new centre for the disease might be establishing itself in Europe.\nWe should take care in making such an interpretation, however. The European victim turns out to be an 80-year-old tourist from China’s Hubei province, the disease’s centre, who arrived in France on 16 January and has been kept in quarantine in a Paris hospital since 25 January. He presumably carried the virus on his journey to Europe and as an octogenarian was particularly vulnerable.\nThis does not mean we should be complacent about the likely impact of Covid-19, however. There are no treatments or vaccines for this virus and, crucially, no pre-existing immunity in the population. During the 2009-10 flu pandemic, many older people were protected because they had already been exposed to the virus strain involved. This will not occur if Covid-19 spreads across Europe and the UK. The elderly are likely to be particularly at risk.\nIn fact, there are so many huge unknowns about this outbreak that it is still impossible to work out how it will progress. For example, we don’t know just how infectious people are before they show symptoms of the disease. A low infection rate suggests death tolls will be modest. A higher one will mean that fatalities could be significant. Careful monitoring of the disease is therefore going to be crucial over the next few months. To date, the National Health Service has responded well. However, it remains to be seen how it will perform when tens of thousands of people gather at hospitals seeking tests for the condition and wards fill up with those found to be infected.\nSuch uncertainty should not be seen as an excuse for inaction, however. As we make clear in our Focus investigation of the coronavirus crisis, urgent measures now need to be taken to head off future pandemics that could catch us off-guard in future, a point that has been highlighted by the billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. “Given the continual emergence of new pathogens… and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal modern-day pandemic will occur in our lifetime,” he warned some time ago.\nCertainly, it is no accident that the most worrying recent pandemics to afflict the planet have emerged from Asia and Africa, in poor countries that have inadequate health services and which are limited in their ability to monitor and isolate cases of newly emerging diseases. Hospitals, medical laboratories and research centres there need bolstering, rapidly, and should now be the focus of major investment by the west. The World Health Organization has done much in this area but it is clear more needs to be achieved, for it appears that the world still does not fully appreciate that outbreaks of deadly new diseases – wherever they emerge – are not someone else’s problem. They will inevitably impinge on lives across the planet.\nAs Professor Trudie Lang, of Oxford University, has put it: “This is not going to be the last outbreak of a previously unknown disease. We have to seize the moment.”"}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/author/thomas-levenson/", "title": "All Stories by Thomas Levenson - The Atlantic", "text": "The term Wuhan virus treats COVID-19 as a Chinese scourge—and ignores an ugly history.\nHow Einstein reacted to Hitler’s rise\nAfter Andrea Wulf won the Royal Society’s highest honor for her book The Invention of Nature, a writer at The Guardian attributed it to a new fondness for “female-friendly” biographies among prize juries.\nThe newly discovered worlds are now the most promising targets in the search for life among the stars—and the race to take a closer look at them has begun.\nThe history of astronomy gives us plenty of reasons to be skeptical about the potential new addition to our solar system.\nScience is not a separate realm that sits outside culture.\nNot even for Einstein"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-india-52393382", "title": "Coronavirus : Is social distancing an oxymoron in India ? ", "text": "Coronavirus: Is social distancing an oxymoron in India?\n-\n- India\nHealth experts and governments across the world have been advising people to practice social distancing to halt the spread of the deadly coronavirus.\nIn India too, we are constantly being told to avoid physical contact and maintain a distance of at least one metre from others.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi himself has talked about it repeatedly in his nationally-televised addresses to the citizens.\n\"If you want to tame the spread of the coronavirus, the only way to do it is to break the cycle of transmission by practicing social distancing,\" he said.\nMillions of people are following his advice, but what transpires every now and then makes one wonder if social distancing is an oxymoron in India.\nSome of the violations are, of course, driven by despair - for instance, when thousands of migrant workers turn up at the railway or bus station in the hope that they may be able to find some transport to return home.\n- Desperate migrant workers trapped in lockdown\nIndia has been under a complete lockdown for the past month, leaving millions of migrant workers stranded in towns and cities, far away from home, with no jobs or money.\nSo, every time they hear rumours that some transport services maybe resumed, crowds have gathered, defying laws on social distancing, at considerable risk to themselves and others.\nThen, there's also the matter of overcrowding. India is a country with more than 1.3 billion people and has a population density of 464 per sq km - in China, the world's most populous country, it is 153 and in the US it's just 36.\nAn average Indian family has five members and 40% of all homes - that is, 100 million homes - have only one room.\n\"In India, it's a privilege to be able to maintain social distancing when most of the population is huddled up five to six in a room,\" Kiran Lamba Jha, assistant professor of sociology at Kanpur's CSJM university, told the BBC.\n\"Social distancing is only possible if you have a large house,\" she said.\nDespair and overcrowding can be legitimate reasons, but in the past month, Indians have also displayed behaviour that defies reason and makes me wonder if we even understand the concept of social distancing?\n- Social distancing: How to persuade others it works\n- The virus reaches 'Asia's biggest slum'\nFor instance, just before the countrywide lockdown began, Mr Modi called upon Indians to observe a day-long self-imposed public curfew on 22 March.\nHe said coronavirus had no cure yet and the only way to stay safe was to stay home.\nAnd to thank those who couldn't stay home - like doctors and nurses and other emergency workers - the prime minister suggested that people come out in their balconies or stand in their doorways at 5pm and clap, beat metal plates, or ring bells for five minutes.\nPeople across India responded enthusiastically by participating in the curfew.\nBut at 5pm, all the good work of the day was undone - large groups of people came out onto the streets in many cities and towns, blowing conch shells, beating drums, clapping and clanging vessels.\nMany took selfies and shouted \"go corona, go\" as processions meandered through the lanes and bylanes.\nIncredibly, some of these processions were led by senior government officials and top policemen - the men who were meant to be educating people about social distancing and enforcing it.\nSimilar scenes were reported a couple of weeks later when Mr Modi called on the people to light candles and clay lamps to show solidarity with those affected by Covid-19.\nBy then, India was in the midst of a strict 21-day lockdown, but at many places, crowds poured out onto the streets, chanting slogans and setting off fireworks.\n\"The events were good at one level because by participating in them, people were trying to express social solidarity in times of crisis,\" says Prof Lamba Jha. \"But then people forgot that corona was still around,\" she laughs.\nBecause of the coronavirus, she says, we find ourselves in a kind of situation that's not normal, but distancing to many Indians is an alien concept.\n\"We say man is a social animal and Indians are more social than others. We don't like being alone, we have large families, we have lots of friends and neighbours, we thrive on social connectedness.\"\nIn places like the capital, Delhi, and across larger cities and towns though, police are working to enforce it strictly. In my local market, shops have circles drawn in chalk outside to ensure shoppers stand one-metre apart at all times.\nThere have been exceptions though - like when slum-dwellers mob a water tanker in a parched Delhi colony or when hundreds of poor and homeless clamour for food being distributed by charities in Noida, a Delhi suburb.\nI've seen photographs of packed vegetable markets three weeks into the lockdown In Patna city.\nAnd in Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad), people are still thronging ration shops and chemist stores.\nAnd in rural India, where 69% of the country's population lives, I hear social distancing is not doing well at all.\nAmarnath Tewary, a senior journalist in the northern state of Bihar, says social distancing is an \"urban phenomenon\".\nIn villages, people often live as a community, many families share a single water source and work together on farms and fields. In local markets, shoppers often stand within touching distance of each other, he says.\nProf Lamba Jha says that's because many villagers still think Covid-19 is a rich man's disease because it came to India from abroad.\n\"They feel cases of coronavirus are only in the cities, everything is fine in the villages.\n\"They can't understand what the fuss is about.\"\n- A SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?\n- AVOIDING CONTACT: The rules on self-isolation and exercise\n- HOPE AND LOSS: Your coronavirus stories\n- VIDEO: The 20-second hand wash\n- STRESS: How to look after your mental health"}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/army-corp-engineers-hospitals-coronavirus/610195/", "title": "The Army Corps of Engineers Is Building New Hospitals", "text": "Gilsinan:It strikes me that what a lot of these things have in common is you’re running into a situation where you have this enormous problem, and I’m curious about how you even begin to conceptualize it.

In the next week, we expect to put in about another 14 facilities and potentially up to another 4,600 beds.\nWe have designed a bunch of facilities, and then given those designs to states and cities. I flew into Miami last week, and I met with the mayor of Miami and the governor of Florida. And my guys said, “We probably need to build out the Miami convention center, and this is about 450 beds.” We needed about ’til the 27th of April to get that one done. There was probably about 21 days we needed.\nThe governor looked at his medical guys and said, “When’s the peak day?” And their medical guys said April 21. And then I told my guys, “Well, then we’re going to be done by the 20th. You don’t have 21 days. Now you have 14 days to get it done. So now go back and come up with a plan.”\nThe whole point here is that we don’t have time for the perfect solution.\nGilsinan:Are the projects going fast enough to handle the need?\nSemonite:It is on all the ones we’re building. But let’s assume that the peak for [a] particular city is the 24th of April, and the 24th was the day all along [when] we thought that a lot of these might peak. Today I’m checking, it’s the 16th, so if we need 10 days to build, and [a] mayor hasn’t made a decision, then when we go in, we say we don’t have the ability anymore to do it in six days.\nI don’t want to get anybody nervous or threatened; I just want to be able to be honest. There’s some things you can do really, really fast. You can fly in a thousand people to a city if they’re really short on doctors and nurses and have them there in probably 48 hours.

Have you ever seen anything like this?\nSemonite:Yes, I have. This is not something simple, where you have only one or two variables. A good example is Puerto Rico. All the electricity, all of the generating plants and power plants were in the south of Puerto Rico. All the people live in the north, San Juan. Puerto Rico is an island. So the only way to get the electricity from the south to the north is to go over a mountain range [with] all of those power poles, 66,000.\nIt’s all complicated—same thing in Iraq. As much as we tried to get the electricity on, all the power plants ran off of oil. All the refineries were blown up, or they were taken out. Although you might have the power plant up and running, it’s kind of like having a gas station go with no gas."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/881018646224cc5d4b9de812ce7fb7d9", "title": "AP Interview : UN chief says new virus poses  enormou risks", "text": "AP Interview: UN chief says new virus poses ‘enormous’ risks\nLAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — The U.N. secretary-general said Tuesday the virus outbreak that began in China poses “a very dangerous situation” for the world, but “is not out of control.”\nSpeaking in an interview with The Associated Press, Antonio Guterres said that “the risks are enormous and we need to be prepared worldwide for that.”\nGuterres said his greatest worry was a spread of the virus to areas with “less capacity in their health service,” particularly some African countries. The World Health Organization is looking into how to help handle such a development, he added.\nEgypt recently reported its first case of the virus, raising fears of its spread to the African continent.\nThe outbreak has infected more than 73,000 people globally. The World Health Organization has named the illness COVID-19, referring to its origin late last year and the coronavirus that causes it.\nChina on Tuesday reported 1,886 new cases and 98 more deaths. That raised the number of deaths in mainland China to 1,868 and the total number of confirmed cases to 72,436.\nTravel to and from the worst-hit central China region was associated with the initial cases of COVID-19 confirmed abroad. But Japan, Singapore and South Korea have identified new cases without clear ties to China or previously known patients, raising concern of the virus spreading locally.\nA report saying the disease outbreak has caused a mild illness in most people raised optimism among global health authorities.\nThe U.N. chief was in Pakistan for a conference on 40 years of refugees fleeing neighboring war-torn Afghanistan.\nIn his interview with the AP, Guterres said that today’s world is a “chaotic” one beset by multiple crises.\nHe decried the horrors of Syria’s 9-year-old civil war. U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock has warned that the most recent exodus of refugees there — nearing 900,000 people fleeing fighting in the northwest Idlib region — risks being the biggest humanitarian disaster of the 21st century.\nSyrian President Bashar Assad has, however, vowed to fight rebels in the country to the bitter end. Backed by Iran and Russia, his forces are making rapid progress against the last rebel-held enclaves in northern Syria. Turkey backs opposition fighters there and has sent troops in to try to stop the Syrian advance.\nSome 3 million Syrian civilians are sheltering in those last rebel-held areas and many of them have been forced out into make-shift shelters and camps amid harsh winter conditions.\nThe suffering of Syrians is “horrible,” Guterres said.\nHe called for an immediate cease-fire, urging Turkey, Russia and Iran to find a political solution.\nTurning to the Libyan civil war, Guterres bemoaned the blatant violations of a U.N.-imposed arms embargo on the North African country.\nForeign powers have intervened in oil-rich Libya’s conflict, apparently jockeying for control over its resources while supporting its rival U.N.-recognized government in the west and east-based government led by self-styled Gen. Khalifa Hifter, who launched an offensive in April 2019 to take the capital, Tripoli.\n“How many countries in Libya are interfering with the conflict and independent of an arms embargo, decided by the Security Council, they go on providing both personnel and equipment to Libya?” he asked.\nHifter’s forces rely on military assistance from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as France and Russia. On the other side, Turkey, Italy and Qatar support the embattled Tripoli-based government in the country’s east.\nThe U.N. chief put some of the blame for the state of world affairs on the three leading powers, the United States, Russia and China, calling their relationship “dysfunctional.” He said it has paralyzed the U.N. Security Council.\n“It is clear that we live in the moment where chaos risks to transform our world in something much more unstable,” he said.\nThe U.N. leader, however, said U.S.-Taliban peace talks presented a chance for ending one of the world’s longest running conflicts, in Afghanistan.\n“We absolutely need to seize this opportunity for peace,″ Guterres said. Millions of Afghans are still living as refugees, he pointed out.\nThe second half of the peace deal between the U.S. and Taliban is expected to be signed on Feb. 29. It calls for Afghans on both sides of the conflict to begin negotiations over the country’s post-war future.

That means 66 people in every 100,000 have died from Covid-19. In the US, with a population of around 330 million, it's 19 in every 100,000, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\nBut those figures are \"faulty comparisons\" that have been \"abused\", argues Prof Steven Van Gucht, a Belgian virologist and government spokesman.\n\"That's the difference between public health science and political motivation,\" he explains. \"That's purely inspired by showing how good you are doing, and it's wrong. We are actually reporting in a more correct way.\"\nWhat's different about Belgium?\nBelgian officials say they are counting in a way that no other country in the world is currently doing: counting deaths in hospitals and care homes, but including deaths in care homes that are suspected, not confirmed, as Covid-19 cases.\nAccording to Belgium's latest official figures, out of 7,703 deaths, 53% have been in care homes.\nSome 16% of deaths in care homes were tested positive for coronavirus. The rest are suspected.\nThat means more than 3,500 deaths have been counted as caused by Covid-19, but not confirmed.\nHow do they work it out?\n\"It's based on the assessment of the medical doctor, usually taking into account whether the coronavirus is present in the same care home,\" says Prof Van Gucht.\n\"For example: if you have one or two confirmed cases, then the week after you have 10 deaths in the same home based on similar symptoms.\"\nPrime Minister Sophie Wilmès recently suggested Belgium may be over-reporting the actual number of cases.\nHowever, Prof Van Gucht says the real number of deaths may still be higher than they are reporting, as he believes they may still be missing a few cases.\nIs it just down to counting?\nAnother factor is that many more people here put loved ones in care homes than elsewhere in Europe.\nOnly the Netherlands and Luxembourg have a higher rate of care home occupancy, relative to their populations.\nOfficials also acknowledge mistakes were made at the beginning: poor preparation left care home staff lacking personal protective equipment (PPE). That allowed the virus to spread quickly, with devastating effect.\nNow all nursing home staff are issued with masks and protective clothing, and nurses from hospitals and the military have been brought in to help.\nEpidemiologists say they've found a \"remarkable\" observation in care homes, that around 10% of residents have been asymptomatic carriers of the virus and have built up an immunity. A small comfort, but of important scientific value.\nHow long has Belgium been in lockdown?\nSince 18 March all non-essential business has been closed and, apart from emergency workers, people have been asked to stay at home.\nShopping is limited to one person per family. You can leave the house for medical reasons, to walk the dog, or for an hour's exercise with immediate family, or one other person, while maintaining social distancing of at least 1.5m (5ft).\nBelgian police have been enforcing the lockdown, using drones in parks and fines for anyone breaking social distancing rules.\nCheckpoints have been set up at the borders with Luxembourg, France and the Netherlands, allowing through only cross-border workers, or those with an urgent reason to enter Belgium.\nSome cyclists have been fined after taking a ride into the Netherlands, then being stopped by Belgian police on the way back.\nNeighbours with different lockdowns\nAll non-food shops have been closed too, which led to a bizarre incident in the neighbouring towns of Baarle Hertog and Baarle Nassau, where the border line runs through a bargain store called Zeemans.\nThe Dutch half of the shop is open, but the Belgian half has been taped off, with customers unable to get to the men's clothing section.\nUnlike Belgium's policy, the Netherlands has what Prime Minister Mark Rutte described as an \"intelligent lockdown\", with florists, ironmongers, bakeries, clothes and toy stores remaining open.\nThere have been fewer deaths in the Netherlands, despite having a larger population. But unlike Belgium, the Netherlands does not count suspected Covid-19 deaths in care homes.\nI asked the head of Belgium's Covid-19 taskforce, Minister Philippe De Backer, if he thought the Belgian confinement method was more effective than the more relaxed Dutch and Swedish approaches.\nHe told me Swedes were renowned for following government advice, while it was \"a bit more difficult in a country like Belgium\". However, he was generally \"impressed by how Belgians has dealt with the crisis\".\n- Has Sweden got its coronavirus science right?\n- European Parliament shelters 100 homeless women\n- Belgium unveils plans to lift lockdown\nWhat happens next?\nBelgium will lift its lockdown gradually, in four phases. From Monday, fabric stores are being opened so people can buy material to make their own face masks. Masks will be mandatory on public transport.\nSport will be allowed, too, though no more than two people can play together.\nAll other shops will open from Monday 11 May. Schools will restart on 18 May, with a maximum of 10 students per class.\nCafes, restaurants and some tourist attractions will open after 8 June, if there has been no second spike in cases. Trips abroad may also be allowed in early June.\n- A SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?\n- AVOIDING CONTACT: The rules on self-isolation and exercise\n- HOPE AND LOSS: Your coronavirus stories\n- TESTING: Can I get tested for coronavirus?\nHow is Belgium testing?\nTesting for Covid-19 is being done on 10-20,000 people a day, with priority for emergency workers.\nThe taskforce has also finished screening all 210,000 residents and staff in care homes, discovering that 10% of people are infected. There are more than 500 care homes, and roughly half have had an outbreak.\nAntibody tests to detect if people have had the virus will start in mid-May.\nWill Belgium use tracking apps ?\nNot in the short term. Taskforce head Philippe De Backer tells me it's not \"feasible\" at the moment, so they will concentrate on the laborious system of tracing manually.\n\"When people test positive, it activates a call centre, and our staff ask who they've been in contact with, and they will be contacted and may have to self-isolate.\"\nMr De Backer says use of an app requires at least 60% of the nation to take part voluntarily and he believes that is not realistic at the moment.\n\"I've seen reports in Austria where it's around 9-10%. So that means you need to do 90% of the tracking in another way,\" he says.\nAs Belgium gradually lifts its restrictions, 2,000 so-called \"corona detectives\" are being hired, to trace people who have been in contact with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patients.\nWhat has Belgium learned?\nBelgian scientists have started to look at lessons that can be learned, including an analysis of why three cities have had the biggest concentration of cases: Charleroi in the south, and Hasselt and Sint-Truiden in the east.\nEarly indications suggest that local carnivals with big gatherings of people in March may have contributed, along with areas where second-generation Italian populations are high. In the case of Charleroi, experts are studying whether the spread was linked to issues of poverty and deprivation.\nBelgian hospitals have been largely able to cope with the epidemic so far, with a 42% occupancy rate now, but some hospitals in Brussels have been overwhelmed, and have had to move patients elsewhere.\nAs the confinement here slowly ends, September is a worry for officials, as Prof Van Gucht makes clear.\n\"When all the schools are open again after the summer, that's when the virus risks spreading quickly again. That's when I'm more afraid, with winter coming too.\""}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/wednesdays_papers_tough_decisions_daycare_infections_meteor_showers/11316784", "title": "Wednesday papers : Tough decisions , daycare infections , meteor showers", "text": "Wednesday's papers: Tough decisions, daycare infections, meteor showers\nMany papers report on the state of the coronavirus epidemic as the government prepares to ease or extend social restrictions.\nFinland's largest circulation daily, Helsingin Sanomat, is among the papers reporting that the government will meet later in the day to consider what to do about the restrictions it has imposed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.\nAs the paper notes, we have managed to reduce contact with others, keep our distance and wash our hands so frequently that the spread of the virus is now flattened. At present, each infected person in Finland is passing the virus on average to just one other person.\nIf that rate of infection falls below one, the number of new infections will start to fall.\nHelsingin Sanomat reports that Turku University Professor Kari Auranen, a member of epidemic modelling group at the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) told a web seminar on Monday that taking into consideration that there is some immunity within the population, the rate of infection is now 0.8 to 0.9 in the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District.\nThe paper speculates on three alternatives right now. The first is whether we can continue to \"hide\" from the virus until a vaccine is available. The second is if should we ease restrictions, let the virus run through the population, but in a manner that will not overwhelm the healthcare system.\nThe third is whether or not we should try to get back to our normal lives while action is taken to push down the infection rate further though comprehensive testing and infection chain tracing.\nAs Helsingin Sanomat points out, continuing the way we are right now is hardly at the top of the list of options. Alternatives, though, must be weighed in an atmosphere of uncertainty.\nIn recent days, the THL group modelling the progress of the epidemic has been hard at work crunching the numbers on what easing restrictions may mean to the spread of the virus.\nDr Tuija Leino, one of the group's members, pointed out some restrictions have been lifted in other countries where infection rates have fallen, and she expects the same to happen in Finland. However, she told the paper that the decision is up to the government, and she is taking no stand on the issue.\nLeino declined however to tell Helsingin Sanomat what the groups findings have been.\n\"The marching order is for the results to go to the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, and to the cabinet where decisions will be made,\" said Tuija Leino.\nDaycare infections\nThe tabloid Iltalehti has news from a press conference Tuesday evening held by Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori where he said that cases of coronavirus infections have been diagnosed at 18 of the city's daycare centres.\nThere have been a total of 26 of these infections. Of those, 24 are members of staff and only two are children.\nHelsinki has 336 public daycare centres that normally provide care for around 27,000 children.\nAt present, daycare centres are providing limited services.\nThe mayor said that at present it is believed that most of the infections were contracted outside the daycare centres.\nAccording to the city's early education director, Satu Järvenkallas, routines at daycare centres have been adjusted to reduce contact among children to a minimum.\nInternational studies have indicated that children infected with the novel corona virus rarely develop serious symptoms.\nHelsinki University Hospital has reported very few cases of infection among under-16 year-olds. The hospital has not had a single child admitted for Covid-19 treatment.\nNo 5G conspiracy takers\nTampere's Aamulehti reports that unlike in some countries, Finland's 5G network towers have not become the target of conspiracy theory activists.\nOne of the more odd spin-offs of the coronavirus epidemic has been an online conspiracy theory claiming that the virus is spread by 5G mobile network signals.\nAs a result, there have been attacks reported on 5G towers in the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden.\nJukka-Pekka Juutinen, who heads the cyber security centre of the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency, told Aamulehti that there have been no similar incidents in Finland, but the agency has been monitoring the conspiracy online.\nOn Sunday a building housing telecommunications equipment at the foot of a telecommunications tower in Pohjanmaa suffered damage in a fire that police believe was a case of arson.\nPolice declined to speculate on any connection to the 5G virus theory, but did say that the facility was a \"normal\" telecommunications installation handling phone and data traffic.\nForests and gender\nThe farmers' union newspaper Maaseudun Tulevaisuus carries a review of a survey indicating that the image of a forest industry worker held by many young people in Finland continues to be a burly, bearded lumberjack swinging an axe.\nCarried out by researchers at the Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT and Helsinki University, the study interviewed over 400 Finns between the ages of 17-18 and found while many said they could consider a career in the forestry sector, few could name products it produced beyond pulp, paper, and furniture.\nAttitudes among the young are important to industries in the field because they are facing a growing need for workers at the same time as fewer are entering the job market and competition for labour is increasing.\nResearchers found that there is a significant gender divide in interest in working in the forest products industry, with exactly half of of young men saying that they believe the sector could offer them an interesting job, while only 35 percent of women felt the same.\nLUT Professor Satu Pätäri told Maaseudun Tulevaisuus that this imbalance may narrow know-how in the sector.\n\"It might not be possible to recognise new business opportunities if the pool of workers is so homogeneous,\" she noted.\nLook up\nThe Swedish-language daily Hufvudstadsbladet tells its readers to look up tonight for a show, as the earth passes through the tail of the Comet Thatcher and the Lyrid meteor shower lights up the sky.\nDrawing on a feature in the science publication Tieteen Kuvalehti, Hufvudstadsbladet notes that the meteor shower returns annually between 16 and 26 April, peaking tonight, 22 April.\nThe paper says that if the weather is clear, you should be able to see up to 20 meteors an hour streak across the night sky."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-viral-recessioneuropes-viral-recession-11584044116", "title": "Europe Viral Recession", "text": "- Opinion\n- Review & Outlook\nEurope’s Viral Recession\nCovid-19 would be less threatening if economies had been healthier.\nEuropean leaders are struggling to cope with the health consequences of Covid-19, and now the next struggle is coming into view—the economy.

Its impact will be felt in every corner of the world. To combat this historic threat, leaders must urgently put aside narrow nationalism and short-term, selfish considerations to work together in the common interest of all humanity.\nAs a former Secretary-General of the U.N., I support the call from my successor António Guterres for an additional $2 billion in humanitarian aid to tackle the pandemic. This aid—which will contribute to key efforts such as developing and distributing tests, treatments and vaccines—is essential to reducing the virus’s spread.\nI also urge global leaders, led by the U.N., to consider how to develop a global governance system that can cope more effectively with any pandemics that may occur in the future. They should recommit to the values of the U.N. Charter, and use other multi-lateral bodies—including the G-20, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank—to proactively support the world’s most vulnerable populations.\nIt is encouraging that G-20 leaders last month committed to implementing any necessary measures to stop the spread of the virus and to injecting $5 trillion into the global economy. But these commitments need to be translated into immediate, proactive assistance to vulnerable countries in Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia. Further, to ensure an effective recovery, this cooperation will need to be strengthened and sustained for some time. It is also crucial that border restrictions and closures, as well as pre-existing sanctions for countries like Iran, which have been severely affected by the pandemic, do not prevent critical medical equipment and supplies from being transported to where they are most urgently needed.\nCOVID-19 shines a harsh light on the many profound inequalities that scar our planet. Disparities of wealth between and within countries now risk being exacerbated even further by the pandemic.\nKeep up to date on the growing threat to global health by signing up for our daily coronavirus newsletter.\nSimilarly, the constraints many countries have imposed on movement and assembly are understandable and necessary under the current circumstances, but legislators and judiciaries must bear in mind that, if not carefully instituted, these restrictions risk accentuating the marginalization of vulnerable groups such as refugees, migrants and racial minorities.\nRespect for human rights, solidarity and justice need to be at the heart of our response to COVID-19. We all have a responsibility as global citizens to stay vigilant and not allow authoritarian regimes to exploit the crisis to roll back rights and democratic safeguards. Otherwise, we risk the prospect of a future where rich countries have recovered and reinstate “normal” patterns of social and economic interaction, but poorer states remain ravaged, with their citizens excluded and subject to new forms of discrimination.\nEven before COVID-19 took hold, we were confronted by the existential threats of climate change and nuclear weapons. In January, I attended the unveiling of the “Doomsday Clock” in Washington, D.C., when the clock’s minute hand was moved closer to midnight than ever before.\nThe clock is still ticking, and these threats have been further aggravated since the outbreak of COVID-19. But if the world can show the necessary courage and leadership today, we will be better placed to tackle equally grave challenges tomorrow.\nBan is the deputy chair of the Elders, an independent group of global leaders, and served as Secretary-General of the U.N. from 2007 to 2016\nThis article is part of a special series on how the coronavirus is changing our lives, with insights and advice from the TIME 100 community.

Officials have described the hospital as “overwhelmed”, “overrun” and calling out for one thing: “Help.”\n“People are going to die,” said Francisco Moya, the New York City council member who represents the Elmhurst neighborhood. “The rate in the next few days [will] continue to go up, and people are going to get scared and get shocked.”\nThe US surpassed virus hotspots China and Italy with 82,404 cases of infection on Thursday night, according to a tracker run by Johns Hopkins University. Hours earlier, New York’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, had announced there were 23,112 Covid-19 cases in New York City alone, and 365 deaths. Queens accounts for one-third of cases in the city.\n“Elmhurst hospital is at the center of responding to this crisis. It’s the No 1 priority of our public hospital system right now,” de Blasio said on Thursday.\nThe hospital is located in one of the poorest and most diverse areas of the city, home to 20,000 recent immigrants from 112 different countries. It was already operating at 80% capacity before the coronavirus pandemic, with plans to expand its emergency department. One doctor told BuzzFeed the facility is “held together by a shoestring”. It was operating at 125% capacity as of Thursday morning, with dozens more people lined up outside seeking tests and treatment.\nIn the Elmhurst and the nearby Corona neighborhood, one in four people lack health insurance. One in four live in poverty. Those numbers have probably grown since Covid-19 put a record 3 million Americans out of their jobs, with more expected to file for unemployment next week.\n“That is a highly immigrant neighborhood,” said Do Jun Lee, a professor of urban studies at Queens College whose research focuses on immigrant delivery workers. “A lot of the Latinx immigrant workers come from that part of Queens – Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, Corona – and they work all over the city delivering food.”\nNew York City is home to 560,000 undocumented immigrants. There is a gulf between the sort of healthcare an undocumented immigrant and a native-born American can access. A city report found 94% of US-born New Yorkers had health insurance, compared to only 42% of undocumented immigrants, in 2018.\n“A lot of the workers who are going to be vulnerable live in Elmhurst, which is a hotbed of what’s going on with the virus right now,” said Lee. “If they need emergency care, they’re going to be going to a hospital that is already overwhelmed.”\nMoya was born at Elmhurst hospital, worked there before he joined the city council, and has represented the hospital for 10 years. He has had daily phone calls with the hospital’s CEO.\n“It’s what was happening in Italy or Spain, but it’s happening in our backyards – in Queens,” he said.\n“It’s real and troubling and scary and when you have a high rate of undocumented people who have to work,” said Moya, citing the many food delivery workers, recent immigrants, low-wage and contract workers who live in the area, “they’re not given the right protection.”\nMoya and fellow council member Carline Rivera wrote a letter to Donald Trump on Thursday saying the hospital and others in Queens were “besieged” and calling for more resources.\n“Elmhurst and Queens hospitals is besieged by this disease. If you speak with any of the staff there, the desperation in their voices is unmistakable,” they wrote.\n“Doctors describe scenes in apocalyptic terms. Patients are reportedly dying in the emergency room still waiting for a bed. Residents line the block, standing inside barricades and in the rain waiting to get tested.”\nLike so many other hospitals in the US and across the world, Elmhurst has also been struggling with a lack of vital equipment and protective gear for medical workers, to help prevent them contracting the disease.\nUnder normal circumstances, Elmhurst has a 15-bed intensive care unit. Now, it is full with Covid-19 patients who require invasive intubation to be on ventilators. As of Thursday morning, 45 of the hospital’s now 63 ventilators were in use, a person with knowledge of hospital inventory said.\nThe patients that come into the hospital, an official said, are extremely sick and deteriorating quickly. No visitors are allowed in the hospital, and the wards whirr with mechanical ventilators.\nIn the last 48 hours, 50 additional hospital staff have been sent to Elmhurst hospital, and 60 patients transferred elsewhere to try to alleviate the strain on hospital staff. De Blasio said he is transferring another 40 ventilators to the hospital.\n“The staff are giving their all to save every patient, but tragically this disease continues to take a terrible toll on the most vulnerable,” de Blasio said. “To the men and women working at Elmhurst right now: your city sees you, your city thanks you and more help is on the way,” he added.\nDoctors who have spoken to the New York Times and other US media reported almost running out of ventilators; working with a “motley” assortment of protective equipment; and admitted patients being left in waiting rooms for hours before a bed is available – often when someone dies.\nWhile Elmhurst appears to be one of the hospitals taking the brunt of the New York outbreak, facilities around the city and state are braced for a surge in patients as the number of cases continues to increase.\n“It is extraordinary.

Please follow local guidance.\nThe gym, an escape and haven in the day-to-day lives of millions, has become yet another source of anxiety in the age of coronavirus.\nAs cases of Covid-19 rise in the U.S., health officials are urging people to practice social distancing. That could make spin classes and yoga sessions seem more harmful than healthy. Yet many fitness fanatics crave exercise more than ever and are forging forward, while taking precautions.\nTony Maloney, the fitness center manager at National Institute for Fitness and Sport in Indianapolis, points out that people should be exercising now more than ever. “When endorphin levels go up, it can counteract the stress response that is so damaging to the immune system,” he says. “Exercise also improves mental health. When you’re feeling down or stressed, exercise can put a smile on your face.”\nMadison Mitteness still braves the treadmill at her gym in New York City, but says she won’t touch the dumbbells or weight machines for fear of germs. Her logic, that the more people touch shared objects, the higher their risk of transmitting a virus, isn’t unfounded.\nBut according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, coronavirus spreads more easily between people standing within about 6 feet than through contact with contaminated surfaces. Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces appears to lower the chances of transmission.\nGregory Poland, director of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., says the gym isn’t necessarily riskier than any other communal area, but people should remain vigilant. His tactic at the gym has been to use hand sanitizer—at least 60% alcohol-based—liberally every time he touches a piece of equipment. In general, things like gym towels, he says, are less risky, since fewer people touch them.\n“If someone with the virus has coughed or sneezed and then touches an inanimate object like a dumbbell or even the pen for a sign-in sheet, there is an increased chance of transmission, but no more than the flu,” he says. In the past four months there have been over 800 cases of novel coronavirus in the U.S. that we know of and, as of Tuesday, 28 deaths.\nIf you live in a city with an outbreak, Dr. Poland suggests skipping the studio and getting your endorphin fix at home through an online class or app. Outdoor exercise is also safe, he says, as long as you keep a distance from people. “A triathlon where you are jammed up with others wouldn’t be smart,” he says.\nHowever, if you live someplace that has not experienced an outbreak, he suggests taking the same precautions you would during flu season. He recommends getting a flu vaccine and working out in areas with a minimum of 3 to 5 feet between pieces of equipment or other people.\nAnd don’t just rinse your hands. Wash them for at least 20 seconds. “I have never seen a lay person wash their hands properly,” he says. “You put your fingertips, not your palms, in your eyes, nose or mouth. No one washes their fingertips.”\nNavigating the Coronavirus\n- Read the full report (articles are free)\n- See live updates on the virus and its impact\n- What We Know About the Coronavirus\n- The Virus and Your Job: A New Set of Questions\n- Essentials of Working From Home\n- How to Keep Your Home Virus-Free\n- Should You Clean Your Phone?

And Equinox says it is disinfecting all clubs with a hospital-grade solution three times a day. It’s asked instructors to eliminate skin-to-skin contact such as adjustments in yoga.\nKeith Worts, the CEO of Crunch Signature, says the company hasn’t seen a change in usage over the past three weeks. “The biggest behavioral shift we’ve seen is that more people wipe down their equipment before and after use,” he says.\nNathan Reyna, a member of Elite by NYSC, an upscale offshoot of New York Sports Club, says he feels less paranoid going to the gym because he feels that his gym’s management is taking the coronavirus threat seriously.\n“Not only have they emailed tips on how to combat the virus, but they have amped up deep cleans,” he says. Mr. Reyna, who says the gym is both his social hub and stress reliever, still takes extra precaution and brings his own disinfectant wipes and thoroughly washes his hands before and after his workouts. “I see a lot more people doing the same,” he says. “Maybe this should be the new norm.”\nKate Pallardy, an elite runner and New York Sports Club member, says she’s always washed her hands well pre- and post-workout. “For me, this is like the scares we’ve had with Zika, SARS or the flu,” she says. “No virus will ever stop me from working out.”\nTIPS TO KEEP HEALTHY AND FIT\nThe continued spread of coronavirus has put hygiene at the top of everyone’s mind. Gyms and fitness studios are urging members to follow the CDC guidelines for preventing the spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\nBeyond washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, here’s what fitness companies and health experts are suggesting people do to stay clean while exercising:\n* If you or someone in your household is sick, stay home from the gym.\n* Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.\n* Avoid the sauna and steam room. Those with colds often use them to break up congestion in the sinuses and lungs.\n* Use the disinfectant wipes available at the gym to wipe down machines and equipment before and after each use.\n* For surface cleaning, check with your gym to see if its products say “disinfectant” on the label and include an EPA registration number.\n* Use hand sanitizers that are at least 60% alcohol.\n* Bring your own yoga mat to class.\n* Avoid contact such as hands-on assists, passing over membership cards at check-in or high-fives with instructors.\n* Avoid packed classes where students are shoulder-to-shoulder. Try to maintain 6 feet of distance from other people.\n* Work out at home using a jump rope or an app or streamable workout.\nCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Initially only people of working age will be invited for a test, according to the health agency, which is carrying out the research in cooperation with the country’s university hospitals.\nTHL said the antibody survey will help to reveal how Covid-19 has spread as well as determine how much of the population has already had the viral infection. In other words, the testing will determine the amount of people who have recovered from the disease.\nThe health agency also said the tests will show the levels of antibodies in people’s bloodstreams as well as how long the virus-fighting cells remain in their systems.\nTHL’s research specialist Merit Melin told Yle in a live webcast on Tuesday that it’s possible 40 to 50 percent of those who have had a novel coronavirus infection were asymptomatic.\nCountry-wide assessment\nThe research will expand beyond the capital region during the spring and will also include all age groups.\nThe researchers' random invitations for testing will start to be sent out this week, according to Jussi Sane, a senior expert at THL, but he noted that the effort will continue for quite some time.\n\"The idea is to get a picture of the situation across the entire country,\" Sane said.\nMeanwhile, Melin said many people have already had Covid-19 in Finland but because they weren’t tested it hasn’t been confirmed.\n\"Thanks to this research we can get the kind of information that's important for everyone. The results perhaps are not that important for individuals, but considering the country’s health as a whole, it is good to know who has been infected,\" Melin said.\nThe agency is aiming to reach 750 new test participants each week. If a test participant’s blood work indicates a presence of antibodies they will be contacted. Participation in the study is voluntary, according to researchers.\n\"The results of the study is one part of assessing the epidemic and will also affect [shelter-in-place and other] restrictions as well as when they can be lifted,\" Sane told Yle.\nThe study will continue throughout the year but initial results are expected by the end of this month.\nEdited 8.4.2020 to define antibodies as blood proteins."}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/22/coronavirus-hits-hard-in-russias-volatile-republic-of-ingushetia-a70067", "title": "Coronavirus Hits Hard in Russia Volatile Republic of Ingushetia", "text": "In late March, as Russia’s coronavirus outbreak fanned out from Moscow to the country’s provinces, Abdurakhman Martazanov, chief mufti of Russia’s autonomous North Caucasus republic of Ingushetia, started to worry.\nBefore many Russians had grasped the reality of the pandemic facing their country, Martazanov put together a set of guidelines allowing Ingushetia’s mostly Muslim population to observe their religion without jeopardizing public health. The faithful were told to pray at home rather than in mosques, funerals were to be kept small with social distancing observed and ritual washing of the dead was to be organized by hospitals.\nBarely two weeks later Martazanov was admitted to hospital with acute respiratory symptoms in Nazran, the republic’s largest city. He died the next day, after testing positive for Covid-19. Buried according to anti-virus guidelines he himself had drawn up, the Islamic religious leader was the second fatality of his tiny republic’s coronavirus outbreak.\nSince the coronavirus first reached Ingushetia local authorities have registered 354 confirmed cases and 12 deaths. With a population of barely 500,000, that’s a per capita infection rate of almost 700 per million inhabitants, far higher than any other Caucasian region, and almost twice that of Russia as a whole.\nMany blame pre-existing factors, including chronic poverty and political unrest for the severity of Ingushetia’s situation.\n“Of course our hospitals have problems and shortages, especially of personal protective equipment, just like anywhere else in Russia,” one local doctor told The Moscow Times on condition of anonymity. “But I don’t think our healthcare is bad enough compared to the rest of the country to have created an outbreak on this scale.”\nAt around the size of Rhode Island, Ingushetia is among Russia’s smallest, poorest and most densely populated regions. While several other remote regions, including the far-northern Komi Republic have experienced intense and localized Covid-19 outbreaks, Ingushetia faces a range of wider problems.\nIt lags other regions in testing, having only administered 2677 coronavirus tests of around two million reportedly taken nationwide. However, few of the locals The Moscow Times spoke to blamed health services for the scale of the republic’s outbreak.\nEver since the Ingush government approved an unpopular land swap with neighboring Chechnya in 2018, Ingushetia has been especially restive, even by the standards of the often-troubled North Caucasus. Widespread outrage at the deal with Chechnya spilled over into months of street protests in the Ingush capital, Magas, and Ingush leader, Yunus-Bek Yevkoruv, resigned last year.\nMany locals now say that the land deal, coupled with underlying problems of corruption and poverty, has made the Ingush government so unpopular that much of the population now refuses to believe the region’s leadership on anything, including the coronavirus. This has led people to be skeptical of all government action surrounding Covid-19, ranging from suspicions of a cover-up, to disbelief in the virus’s existence.\n“Trust has completely collapsed between the government and the people,” said Izabella Yevloyeva, an Ingush journalist forced to leave the region during the land-deal protests who now lives in Prague. “A lot of people just assume that the coronavirus is a government conspiracy to keep them under control.”\nYevloyeva added that when she published figures on the coronavirus in Ingushetia, readers accused her of lying and promoting fake, pro-government statistics. This instinctive suspicion of the regional government means that the self-isolation regime in force since March is not being observed, she suggested.\nAgainst government instructions, weddings, funerals and other gatherings are continuing as before. Over the weekend, much of the population of Nesterovskaya, a town near the Chechen border, turned out to search for, and eventually find, a missing child, despite official discouragement.\nLocal authorities themselves have admitted that their social distancing orders are not being obeyed. In an emotional Sunday night video address Makhmud-Ali Kalimatov, head of the Ingush government, blamed “those who irresponsibly post fabrications on social media” for fuelling the republic’s explosion in cases.\n“All we ask is that people strictly adhere to the self-isolation regime,” said Kalimatov. “Help us, or at least don’t obstruct us.”\nIronically, the authorities’ perceived failure to get to grips with the pandemic has many Ingush admiring the public health approach taken by Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader whose land swap discredited the Ingush authorities. In much larger Chechnya, where Kadyrov has called for quarantine breakers to be killed, Covid-19 cases are much fewer than in Ingushetia.\n“I may not agree with Kadyrov’s undemocratic approach,” said Yevloyeva, “but harsh measures do seem to have worked in Chechnya.”\nMany of Ingushetia’s problems are common to other regions in the North Caucasus. In the neighboring republic of North Ossetia, the economic fallout of strict self-isolation rules has fuelled protests against an unpopular regional government by locals subscribing to similar conspiracy theories casting doubt on the existence of coronavirus. However, many locals see the situation in Ingushetia as uniquely dangerous for public health.\n“This kind of distrust of government exists everywhere in Russia,” said Ruslan Mutsolgov, leader of the Ingush branch of liberal opposition party YABLOKO. “But here in Ingushetia, it’s especially huge.”\nPlea for aid package\nMany suggest that the republic’s socio-economic situation is to blame for the failure of social distancing and the severity of its Covid-19 outbreak. Ranked 79 of 83 Russian regions by GDP, and with unemployment officially at 26%, Ingushetia’s economy is likely too weak to sustain self-isolation without substantial financial support.\n“If you want to order people to self-isolate, fine,” said Mutsolgov. “But you have to provide them with support to do so. Almost no one in Ingushetia has any kind of financial cushion, so if we’re going to fight the virus, then the government has to provide one.”\nThough the Ingush government has begun distributing aid to the poorest households, Mutsolgov believes it is still insufficient. His party has published an open letter to the republic’s government, demanding a comprehensive aid package, including support for small businesses and compensation for lost wages, as a way to rally the Ingush population behind self-isolation measures.\n“We’re only going to survive this if the government supports the people. Without support, this situation will only get worse.”"}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/nursing-homes-must-report-coronavirus-cases-cdc-32990872-c9b3-4a5f-b458-213cd77aef47.html", "title": "Nursing homes must report all coronavirus cases to families , CDC", "text": "Nursing homes must now report all coronavirus cases\nSeema Verma during the coronavirus briefing at the White House on Sunday.

Put simply: We weren’t as ready as we should have been, and the price will be steep. As we pull out all the stops to meet the exigencies of the moment, we should be thinking hard about lessons for the future.\nToday we face a national emergency that is likely to stress our health-care institutions to their limits. A now-familiar contrast is between South Korea, which responded quickly with mass testing, and Italy, which did not. Regrettably, the U.S. response resembles Italy’s.\nAs of March 3, Italy had 2,502 reported Covid-19 cases. By March 11, that figure stood at 12,462; by March 16, it was 27,980. On March 11, the U.S. total stood at 1,301; on March 16, it was 4,663. We’re on roughly the same upward curve as Italy, about 8 to 10 days behind.\nNot only has our testing regime been woefully inadequate, but U.S. politicians and health authorities were very slow to impose—or even recommend—the stringent social distancing needed to slow the virus’s spread once containment efforts had failed. Inevitably, the U.S. peak infection rate will be much higher than it could have been.\nAbsent mass testing, we cannot know for sure how far the epidemic has already progressed. But even if the U.S. has a better-case rate of infection, the health-care system will be stretched to its limit.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services estimates that if Covid-19 resembles the relatively mild 1957 flu pandemic, 38 million Americans will need medical care, one million will require hospitalization, and 200,000 will need intensive care. A report released Monday by Imperial College London estimates that even with successful household quarantines and social distancing, U.S. Covid-19 deaths could exceed one million.\nRight now, says HHS, the U.S. has only 924,000 hospital beds and 98,000 intensive-care beds. The system could be overwhelmed, especially if hot spots emerge, as they did in Northern Italy. In these circumstances, we would face rationing or triage, which would mean denying optimal treatment to many desperately sick patients.\nWe also face chokepoints of crucial supplies, such as ventilators, protective gear for medical personnel, testing kits and even the chemicals needed for mass testing.\nFinally, the system creates institutional roadblocks to the efficient delivery of care. Public-health labs are short of the staff and equipment needed to run large numbers of tests. Citing the lack of protective gear and the fear of spread, many physicians are reluctant to do in-office testing.\nRural hospitals face distinctive problems. Many are short of basic equipment, but suppliers are limiting their new orders to previous levels, which are irrelevant to current needs. They lack rooms with the negative airflow needed to seal off infectious diseases and are short of ventilators as well.\nRegulatory complexity poses additional challenges. Some hospitals, for example, are experiencing shortages of the purified air-powered respirators needed to clean the rooms of Covid-19 patients who have been treated and to handle the remains of those who have died. But because these respirators are classified as hazardous materials, airlines are prohibited from transporting them, dramatically slowing delivery.\nKey public officials acknowledge that we have been caught short. Anthony Fauci, who has become the most prominent public face of the crisis, said Thursday, “The idea of anybody getting [tested] easily the way people in other countries are doing it? We’re not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we’re not.”\nThis is not an accident. Long-term trends in the public and private sectors have interacted to produce it.\nMost states cut funding for public-health services after the 2007-09 recession, and many never fully restored it. Overall, staffing is down about a quarter since 2008, and the situation is worse in many states.\nThis situation is only marginally better at the federal level. Adjusted for inflation, funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is down 10% from 2010, and funding for the federal Public Health Emergency Preparedness program has fallen by a third since 2002.\nPrivate hospitals, under pressure from governments and insurers, have adopted just-in-time inventory strategies, lack deep reserves of supplies, and keep bed occupancy rates as close to 100% as possible.\nWe may have been flying blind a month ago, but now we know what works: mass testing and social distancing. We know what doesn’t: muddled chains of command and mixed messages.\nCan the nation that once served as the arsenal of democracy ramp up production of respirator masks, protective gear and testing kits fast enough to meet the scale of the crisis? Can the nation that planted victory gardens discipline itself well enough to slow the spread of Covid-19 until the health-care system catches up?\nThis is more than a test of our institutions; it is a test of our character. God help us if we fail."}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-america-supply-chain-labor-shortage-394410d5-045c-4eff-9395-bc1ed4b01c79.html", "title": "Coronavirus tests America supply chains amid possible labor shortages", "text": "Coronavirus tests America's supply chains amid possible labor shortages\nIcon Sportswire / Contributor\nConsumers are stocking up on goods as the novel coronavirus spreads, but COVID-19 itself is already testing America's supply chains and could bring possible labor shortages, The Washington Post reports.\nWhy it matters: There is enough nonperishable food in warehouses and production lines to last months, but the \"challenge could soon be getting that food to the right places once local distribution centers are wiped out,\" the Post writes.

She’s interested in all things nationalism and populism.\nLast week, the far-right Alternative for Germany backed a center-right candidate for state governor in the country’s eastern state of Thuringia—a candidate also supported by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s more centrist ruling Christian Democrats. He won.\nSuch an alliance is a big deal in Germany, where cooperation between mainstream parties and the far right remains extremely taboo. Not only did the just-elected state governor resign in the fallout, but the leader of the Christian Democrats, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer—Merkel’s own chosen successor—did too.\nIf Europe’s mainstream parties take away anything from this episode, it should be this: As politics continues to fragment, far-right parties will grow only more influential. The only way to avoid working with them is for mainstream parties to seek out new partners, including nontraditional allies on the left, such as the Greens.\nPAUL SPELLA /THE ATLANTIC\n4.WHAT FICTION CAN DO\nLiterature has distinguishedThe Atlanticfrom its beginnings.\nThomas Gebremedhinis a New York–based editor atThe Atlantic, where he helps oversee the new fiction initiative.\nOver more than 160 years, our magazine has helped shape the literary canon, publishing destined-to-become-classic short fiction by writers such as William Faulkner, James Baldwin, Raymond Carver, and Alice Munro.\nWe are (re)committing to regularly running exceptional short fiction. In January, we published Lauren Groff’s “Birdie,” and this month we published Samantha Hunt’s “Go, Team” (if you are interested in the craft, here is my Q&A with Hunt). Both writers bring a distinctive perspective and stylistic approach to their work. The presence of such stories in our pages functions both as a welcome distraction from the news of the day and as another entry point into understanding humanity.\nEach month, we will be searching for writers, established as well as new, whose fiction surprises and moves us—fiction that, as the short-story writer Jessamyn West once said, “reveals truth that reality obscures.”\nDid you like this?

Of those Americans whodidreport regularly drinking Corona, only 4 percent said they would now stop drinking the beer.\nA number of major news outlets appear to have walked right into the trap. Because they did not understand that the original press release was walking a fine line between deeply misleading claims and outright lies, their articles have inadvertently fallen on the side of the lie. As a viral tweet by CNN put it, the survey supposedly found that 38 percent of Americans would not drink Corona, “because of the coronavirus.”\nIt is one thing for unscrupulous PR agencies to get their name out by trying to mislead the public in a shameless manner. It is quite another for some of the country’s most prestigious and well-known media outlets to let themselves be played.\nAfter repeated phone calls, emails, and tweets to 5WPR and its chief executive, I was finally able to get access to the full questions asked in the poll. These make clear that the survey was a fishing expedition designed to elicit viral stats. The questions asked in the poll include “Is Corona related to the coronavirus?” and “In light of the coronavirus, do you plan to stop drinking Corona?” But my requests for the results to these questions have so far gone unheeded. Maybe, just maybe, that’s because the results show that most Americans get the difference between a disease and a beer.\nGay Courter: I prepared for everything, but not coronavirus on a cruise ship\nAriel Edwards-Levy, the polling editor forHuffPostand one of the first journalists to register skepticism about the poll on Twitter, has also been unable to get access to the actual data. As she told me, “One of the best things a media outlet can do when reporting on polls is to insist on transparency about exactly what questions were asked and whom they were asked of. It’s also important that reporters treat polling as critically as they would any other source—for instance, being wary of ‘shock’ findings, contextualizing results with other available data, and avoiding the tendency to overstate or overinterpret results.”\nBy all appearances, journalists working for outlets from CNN to theNew York Posthave failed this test. As a result, they have made themselves unwitting tools of a clever misinformation campaign. (Journalists for CNN,Vice, and theNew York Posthave not yet responded to messages asking for comment.)\nT\nhe strange virality of the Corona poll demonstrates that there are ruthless PR flacks who are willing to play fast and loose with the truth. It also shows that there are many journalists at supposedly trustworthy news outlets who are so desperate to rush to publication that they can wind up misinforming their public. (What else is new?)\nThe real question is why this obscure poll would, even if it had been true, be able to capture the imagination of so many people. And the answer is as obvious as it is saddening: Clearly, a lot of Americans already think that their fellow citizens are stupid. The real reason a fake finding could have spread so far so quickly is that it confirmed prejudices about the world that many have held all along.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

", "text": "Many infectious diseases wax and wane with the seasons. Flu typically arrives with the colder winter months, as does the norovirus vomiting bug. Others, such as typhoid, tend to peak during the summer. Measles cases drop during the summer in temperate climates, while in tropical regions they peak in the dry season.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, many people are now asking whether we can expect similar seasonality with Covid-19. Since it first emerged in China around mid-December, the virus has spread quickly, with the number of cases now rising most sharply in Europe and the US.\nMany of the largest outbreaks have been in regions where the weather is cooler, leading to speculation that the disease might begin to tail off with the arrival of summer. Many experts, however, have already cautioned against banking too much on the virus dying down over the summer.\nYou might also like:\n● Drinking water will not kill the coronavirus\n● How long does the coronavirus survive on surfaces?\n● Does sunshine kill the coronavirus?\nAnd they are right to be cautious. The virus that causes Covid-19 – which has been officially named SARS-CoV-2 – is too new to have any firm data on how cases will change with the seasons. The closely related Sars virus that spread in 2003 was contained quickly, meaning there is little information about how it was affected by the seasons.\nBut there are some clues from other coronaviruses that infect humans as to whether Covid-19 might eventually become seasonal.\nThere is some hope that as temperatures warm up in the Northern Hemisphere, cases of coronavirus will start to fall (Credit: Getty Images)\nA study conducted 10 years ago by Kate Templeton, from the Centre for Infectious Diseases at the University of Edinburgh, UK, found that three coronaviruses – all obtained from patients with respiratory tract infections at hospitals and GP surgeries in Edinburgh – showed “marked winter seasonality”. These viruses seemed to cause infections mainly between December and April – a similar pattern to that seen with influenza. A fourth coronavirus, which was mainly found in patients with reduced immune systems, was far more sporadic.\nThere are some early hints that Covid-19 may also vary with the seasons. The spread of outbreaks of the new disease around the world seems to suggest it has a preference for cool and dry conditions, although it is worth noting that the virus has appeared in countries with a wide range of climates, including hot humid ones.\nAn unpublished analysis comparing the weather in 500 locations around the world where there have been Covid-19 cases seems to suggest a link between the spread of the virus and temperature, wind speed and relative humidity. Another unpublished study has also shown higher temperatures are linked to lower incidence of Covid-19, but notes that temperature alone cannot account for the global variation in incidence.\nFurther as-yet-unpublished research predicts that temperate warm and cold climates are the most vulnerable to the current Covid-19 outbreak, followed by arid regions. Tropical parts of the world are likely to be least affected, the researchers say.\nPandemics often don’t follow the same seasonal patterns seen in more normal outbreaks\nBut without real data over a number of seasons, researchers are relying upon computer modelling to predict what might happen over the course of the year.\nExtrapolating data about Covid-19’s seasonality based on endemic coronaviruses – meaning viruses which have been circulating in human populations for some time – is challenging. That's not least because endemic viruses are seasonal for a number of reasons that might not currently apply to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nPandemics often don’t follow the same seasonal patterns seen in more normal outbreaks. Spanish flu, for example, peaked during the summer months, while most flu outbreaks occur during the winter. (Read more about what Spanish flu can teach us about Covid-19.)\n“Eventually we would expect to see Covid-19 becoming endemic,” says Jan Albert, a professor of infectious disease control who specialises in viruses at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. “And it would be really surprising if it didn't show seasonality then. The big question is whether the sensitivity of this virus to [the seasons] will influence its capacity to spread in a pandemic situation. We don’t know for sure, but it should be in the back of our heads that it is possible.”\nWe need to be cautious, therefore, when using what we know about the seasonal behaviour of other coronaviruses to make predictions about the current Covid-19 pandemic. But why are related coronaviruses seasonal, and why does that offer hope for this outbreak?\nCoronaviruses are a family of so-called “enveloped viruses”. This means they are coated in an oily coat, known as a lipid bilayer, studded with proteins that stick out like spikes of a crown, helping to give them their name – corona is Latin for crown.\nThere are currently few studies that look at the impact the weather has on Covid-19 (Credit: Getty Images)\nResearch on other enveloped viruses suggests that this oily coat makes the viruses more susceptible to heat than those that do not have one. In colder conditions, the oily coat hardens into a rubber-like state, much like fat from cooked meat will harden as it cools, to protect the virus for longer when it is outside the body. Most enveloped viruses tend to show strong seasonality as a result of this.\nResearch has already shown that Sars-Cov-2 can survive for up to 72 hours on hard surfaces like plastic and stainless steel at temperatures of between 21-23C (70-73F) and in relative humidity of 40%. Exactly how the Covid-19 virus behaves at other temperatures and humidity has still to be tested, but research on other coronaviruses suggests they can survive for more than 28 days at 4C. (Read more about how long Covid-19 can survive on surfaces.)\nA closely related coronavirus that caused the Sars outbreak in 2003 has also been found to survive best in cooler, drier conditions. For example, dried Sars virus on smooth surfaces remained infectious for over five days at between 22-25C and with a relative humidity of 40–50%. The higher the temperature and humidity, the shorter the virus survived.\n“Climate comes into play because it affects the stability of the virus outside the human body when expelled by coughing or sneezing, for example,” says Miguel Araújo, who studies the effects of environmental change on biodiversity at the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid, Spain. “The greater the time the virus remains stable in the environment, the greater its capacity to infect other people and become epidemic. While Sars-Cov-2 has quickly spread all over the world, the major outbreaks have mainly occurred in places exposed to cool and dry weather.”\nA recent analysis suggests that this pandemic coronavirus will be less sensitive to the weather than many hope\nHis computer models certainly seem to match the pattern of outbreaks around the world, with the highest number of cases outside of the tropics.\nAraújo believes that if Covid-19 shares a similar sensitivity to temperature and humidity, it could mean cases of coronavirus will flare up at different times around the world.\n“It is reasonable to expect the two viruses will share similar behaviour,” he says. “But this is not a one-variable equation. The virus spreads from human to human. The more humans at any given place and the more they get into contact with each other, the more infections there will be. Their behaviour is key to understanding the propagation of the virus.”\nA study from the University of Maryland has shown that the virus has spread most in cities and regions of the world where average temperatures have been around 5-11C (41-52F) and relative humidity has been low.\nBut there have been considerable numbers of cases in tropical regions, too. A recent analysis of the spread of the virus in Asia by researchers at Harvard Medical School suggests that this pandemic coronavirus will be less sensitive to the weather than many hope.\nThey conclude that the rapid growth of cases in cold and dry provinces of China, such as Jilin and Heilongjiang, alongside the rate of transmission in tropical locations, such as Guangxi and Singapore, suggest increases in temperature and humidity in the spring and summer will not lead to a decline in cases. They say it underlines the need for extensive public health interventions to control the disease. (Read more about why social distancing is so important.)\nLaboratory research and computer modelling suggest Covid-19 will be less able to survive in warm and humid conditions (Credit: Getty Images)\nThis is because the spread of a virus depends on far more than simply its ability to survive in the environment. And this is where understanding the seasonality of diseases becomes complicated. For a disease like Covid-19, it is people who are now spreading the virus, and so seasonal changes in human behaviour can also lead to shifts in infection rates.\nMeasles cases in Europe, for example, tend to coincide with school terms and decrease during the holidays when children are not spreading the virus to one another. The enormous migration of people around the Chinese Lunar New Year on 25 January has also been suggested to have played a key role in the spread of Covid-19 out of Wuhan to other cities in China and around the world.\nThe weather can also mess with our own immune systems to make us more vulnerable to infections, too. There is some evidence to suggest the vitamin D levels in our bodies can have an affect on how vulnerable we are to infectious diseases. In the winter our bodies make less vitamin D from sunlight exposure, mainly because we spend more time indoors and wrap ourselves in clothing against the cold air. But some studies have found this theory is unlikely to account for seasonal variation seen in diseases like flu.\nMore controversial is whether cold weather weakens our immune systems – some studies suggest it does, but others find the cold can actually boost the number of cells that defend our bodies from infection.\nThere is stronger evidence, however, that humidity can have a greater impact on our vulnerability to disease. When the air is particularly dry, it is thought to reduce the amount of mucus coating our lungs and airways. This sticky secretion forms a natural defence against infections and with less of it, we are more vulnerable to viruses.\nStopping contact between people should also bring down the infection rates\nOne intriguing study by scientists in China suggests there is some sort of relationship between how deadly Covid-19 can be and the weather conditions. They looked at nearly 2,300 deaths in Wuhan, China, and compared them to the humidity, temperature and pollution levels on the day they occurred.\nAlthough it has yet to be published in an academic journal, their research suggests mortality rates were lower on days when the humidity levels and temperatures were higher. Their analysis also suggests that on days where the maximum and minimum temperature ranges were greater, there were higher levels of mortality. But this work is largely also based on computer modelling, so the exact nature of this relationship, and whether it will be seen in other parts of the world, is still to be explored.\nAs the virus causing the Covid-19 pandemic is new, it is unlikely many people, if anyone, will have immunity against it until they have been infected and have recovered. This means the virus will spread, infect and cause disease in a way quite unlike endemic viruses.\nAir travel has been the main route by which the virus has spread around the world so rapidly, says Vittoria Colizza, director of research at the French Institute of Health and Medical Research. But once it starts spreading within a community, it is close contact between people that drives the transmission. Stopping contact between people should also bring down the infection rates. This is exactly what many governments have been attempting to do with the escalating lockdown of public places around the world.\nEven if cases of Covid-19 do fall over the summer months, it is unlikely to disappear entirely and will return later in the year (Credit: Getty Images)\n“There’s no evidence yet for a seasonal behaviour of Covid-19,” says Colizza. “The behavioural component may play a role, too.” But she warns it is too early to know if the measures put in place will be enough to stall the spread of the virus. “By itself, it may partially reduce effective contagiousness due to the reduction of contacts along which the disease could be transmitted.”\nAnd if cases of Covid-19 do indeed tail off over the coming months it could be for a number of reasons – prevention measures such as isolation and lockdowns are being successful; there is growing immunity in the population; or it may be an effect of the season, as Albert’s models suggest.\n“If there is a seasonal effect, it could mask the true impact of the other two,” warns Albert. “In countries where a strong lockdown has meant not many people have been exposed, then I wouldn’t be surprised that we will see a second wave come the fall and winter.”\nEven if Covid-19 does show some seasonal variability, it is unlikely to disappear entirely over the summer months, as some have suggested. But a dip in cases might bring some benefits.\n“The steps we are taking to flatten out the curve are expensive in economic terms, but they could help us push this pandemic into the summer,” says Albert. “If there is some seasonality, it might buy health systems the time they need to prepare.”\nAnd in a world scrambling to cope with the rapidly rising number of cases, it might just be time we desperately need.\n--\nAs an award-winning science site, BBC Future is committed to bringing you evidence-based analysis and myth-busting stories around the new coronavirus.

They may, for instance, start to skip vacations or dine out less. Airlines and restaurants, in turn, might lose revenue or even limit service because of what they think their customers will do.

The Bank of England eased monetary policy. And Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, unveiled the largest sustained fiscal loosening since the early 1990s. He announced a £30bn ($39bn), or 1.3% of GDP, giveaway for the coming year, made up of £12bn of immediate virus-related spending and £18bn of other measures. Fiscal prudence would appear to have been an early casualty of this government—and of the virus.\nIn his budget speech Mr Sunak noted that one in five workers may be simultaneously absent in the coming weeks, creating a concurrent shock to both supply and demand. He argued that, because the hit to supply was likely to be transitory, the best response was a “temporary, targeted and timely” boost to support demand in the short run and try to stop hard-hit firms going out of business. The mutation of covid-19 from a Chinese crisis into a global one came too recently for it to be reflected in the forecasts of the Office of Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog. So policymakers are, to a greater extent than usual, flying blind.\nThe bank reduced base rates by 50 basis points back to the post-crisis low of 0.25%, a bigger cut than investors had expected. It also introduced a new facility to give banks access to cheap liquidity to sustain lending for small- and medium-sized businesses and it cut capital requirements. City economists were quick to note that, although interest rates cannot be reduced much further, the bank could still choose to restart its programme of quantitative easing should the outlook darken.\nThe real action came on the fiscal side. Mr Sunak outlined a three-pronged strategy to cushion the blow from the virus on the public services, on households and on businesses. For the first he essentially wrote a short-term blank cheque, pledging to give the NHS whatever financial resources it required. Some £5bn has been set aside as an emergency-response fund. Support for households will take the form of early entitlement to sick pay for those required to isolate themselves and easier access to welfare payments for the self-employed and those working in the gig economy.\nThe support for businesses, especially smaller ones, was the most substantial element. The main goal was to ease potential cashflow problems. Firms with fewer than 250 employees will have any statutory sick pay picked up by the government. The “time to pay” scheme, which lets firms restructure tax payments, will be extended. Business rates, a property tax, will be cut to zero for the coming year for most small firms in industries such as retailing, hospitality and leisure. Some 700,000 especially tiny firms eligible for small-business-rate relief will receive a one-off payment of £3,000 to help them manage.\nThe reaction from the main business lobbies was positive. The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the chancellor’s efforts to help firms manage their cashflow. Ian Stewart, chief economist of Deloitte, a professional-services firm, hailed the Treasury’s and the bank’s actions as “a forceful and convincing response to the crisis”. According to one corporate restructuring specialist, easier credit conditions and a delayed schedule of tax payments should help to prevent “thousands of insolvencies over the next few months. There are firms that would have gone to the wall that now won’t.”\nWhether these measures will prove sufficient will depend as much on epidemiology as on economics. The ultimate impact of the virus is still impossible to quantify. But the emergency measures masked a wider shift in the government’s fiscal strategy. Even excluding any covid-19 related economic slowdown, as well as the £12bn response package announced so far, the government is set to borrow significantly more in the next five years than it had previously planned (see chart). The deficits planned in 2019 for the years from 2021 to 2024 have all been revised up by more than 1% of GDP.\nFor the past decade British fiscal policy has aimed at reducing the ratio of public debt to GDP over the medium term. This target has been quietly dumped in favour of stabilising the debt ratios. Such a long-term shift in policy may ultimately matter more than any emergency medicine.■\nDig deeper:\n- For more coverage of covid-19 see our coronavirus hub\n- The science of the virus\n- Fatality rates for covid-19 could vary enormously\n- How to deal with a new sort of financial shock\n- Should other countries copy Italy’s nationwide lockdown?\nThis article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline \"Economic medicine\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/opinion/coronavirus-prepare-test.html", "title": "Opinion | How to Confront the Coronavirus at Every Level", "text": "Covid-19 cases in Washington State and California appear to show that the disease has begun to spread in those communities, at least. Its spread elsewhere in the country has yet to be determined. But developments with this disease, of which there have been more than 70 cases in the United States, change quickly.\nSo the federal government, state and local governments, public health agencies, health care systems and industry should be preparing more actively to respond to a widespread outbreak of the virus.\nHealth care systems need plans to diagnose people rapidly, so those who are infected can be isolated before they spread Covid-19 to the hospital staff, or to other patients and family members. That will require setting up testing centers in clinics or in hospital locations well removed from crowded emergency departments and waiting rooms.\nUp until this week, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been doing all the lab testing for Covid-19. Technical challenges have slowed the distribution of this test, but now public health labs around the country have the authority to use it in their cities and states. Once there is enough testing capacity, testing should be done for anyone with symptoms consistent with Covid-19, and priority should be given to the sickest hospitalized patients.\nThe demand for clinical testing is likely to outstrip the capacity of public health labs and the C.D.C., so diagnostic companies will need to develop rapid, high-volume tests for hospitals and clinics. The federal government needs to make clear to those companies that they will be fully compensated for accelerating the development and production of such tests.\nStrong infection-control plans are essential, and they include the provision of personal protective equipment for all staff that care for patients. Reports that federal health officials who worked with Wuhan evacuees might not have been properly trained or equipped to prevent infection underscore how crucial it is to plan ahead and put systems in place.\nHospitals should be making plans to care for high numbers of critically ill patients; cancel elective surgeries if necessary; change staffing patterns; and seek additional ventilators, either from vendors or from the national stockpile.\nManufacturers need to expand the production of personal protective equipment for health care workers, and they need to receive assurances from the federal government that they will be compensated, even if health care institutions don’t end up needing the equipment.\nMedical facilities other than hospitals also need rigorous infection control, and health care workers need to be protected, in order to maintain safe access to both routine and emergency care. In China, some outpatient cancer clinics and dialysis centers have been closed or disrupted by Covid-19. We need to make sure that doesn’t happen here.\nLong-term care facilities must focus even more rigorously on prevention, given the risks faced by the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, and the propensity of this disease to spread within closed systems, such as the Diamond Princess cruise ship and prisons in China.\nIn a number of places in the United States, public health agencies are keeping suspected cases isolated, retracing the interactions of Covid-19 patients, retracing family members, co-workers and other people with whom the patient was within six feet for a sustained time, and ensuring that high-risk contacts are isolated. If the number of cases increases significantly, however, that may no longer to be possible. At that point, public health agencies will need to focus on tracking the extent of Covid-19 in the larger population; ensuring that the public knows the importance of staying isolated when sick; and issuing instructions on how to proceed when someone is sick, but not sick enough to be in the hospital.\nIt may seem too obvious to mention, but officials need to clearly tell people to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds after contact with others and before eating, to cough or sneeze into your sleeve, not their hands, and to understand symptoms of illness and how to get diagnosed in any given community.\nPublic health professionals will also need to work with political leaders to make hard decisions on if or when large events should be canceled, workers should be told to telecommute, schools should change the way they operate or schools should close. While these actions may slow the spread of the disease, they could have negative consequences. If schools close, for example, many children will not get school meals they depend on, not to mention the learning time they will miss and the workers who will have to stay home to care for their children.\nPrivate companies will need to develop therapies and vaccines. While leading vaccine scientists have said it might take 12 to 18 months before a vaccine is ready to be given to the public, there may be antiviral or antibody-based medicines that could be developed far sooner. The federal government has existing partnerships with a number of companies that are working — or could work — to develop therapies or vaccines. The government also needs to ensure that if these companies succeed, their products will be mass manufactured to be able to meet potentially extraordinary demand. Companies have been burned by governments before, when they have been asked to develop products during crises, only to have governments back away from commitments when the crises diminish. This work will be costly. Public health agencies already are scrambling to meet their normal responsibilities with too little funding, and the Trump administration’s recent budget proposed cuts to programs that fund this work.\nThe White House and Congress are negotiating on how much money to spend on these efforts. The emergency funding for the Ebola response in 2014 was $5.4 billion. Covid-19 will require twice as much money or more. Unlike Ebola, it is a new disease for which we have no countermeasures, it is transmissible through the air, and it is already present in many places around the world.\nOne final priority is for the public to get clear and forthright information from federal and local leaders. One day last week, C.D.C. officials were correctly saying there were clear risks of the virus spreading and that the public should be prepared, while the president’s economic adviser was falsely saying the virus was contained. That kind of mixed information can undermine confidence in government efforts. The public can see that the virus is not contained globally and that there is a clear risk it will spread in the United States. It is important for national leaders to be straightforward about that and brief the public every day on what new information has developed, what decisions have been made, what is anticipated in the days ahead and what is being done to resolve any uncertainties.\nWhile it is important for the White House to coordinate the response of the many agencies involved, it should not be a filter between the nation’s top health experts and the press. The Department of Health and Human Services and the C.D.C. need to speak directly to the public and to the press every day.\nIn its communications with the public, the administration has focused intently on the patients who have been found to have the disease, but it must look ahead now.\nWe have many tools to slow and reduce the overall impact of Covid-19. But this disease has taken many countries by surprise in recent weeks and caused great concern around the world. We need to bring our substantial resources and expertise to bear quickly and decisively at every level.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/air-pollution-may-be-key-contributor-to-covid-19-deaths-study", "title": "Air pollution may be  key contributor  to Covid - 19 deaths – study | Environment", "text": "Air pollution may be ‘key contributor’ to Covid-19 deaths – study\nResearch shows almost 80% of deaths across four countries were in most polluted regions\n- Coronavirus – latest updates\n- See all our coronavirus coverage\nHigh levels of air pollution may be “one of the most important contributors” to deaths from Covid-19, according to research.\nThe analysis shows that of the coronavirus deaths across 66 administrative regions in Italy, Spain, France and Germany, 78% of them occurred in just five regions, and these were the most polluted.\nThe research examined levels of nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant produced mostly by diesel vehicles, and weather conditions that can prevent dirty air from dispersing away from a city. Many studies have linked NO2 exposure to health damage, and particularly lung disease, which could make people more likely to die if they contract Covid-19.\n“The results indicate that long-term exposure to this pollutant may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the Covid-19 virus in these regions and maybe across the whole world,” said Yaron Ogen, at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany, who conducted the research. “Poisoning our environment means poisoning our own body, and when it experiences chronic respiratory stress its ability to defend itself from infections is limited.”\nThe analysis is only able to show a strong correlation, not a causal link. “It is now necessary to examine whether the presence of an initial inflammatory condition is related to the response of the immune system to the coronavirus,” Ogen said.\nA separate study published on 7 April looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with far higher Covid-19 death rates. Another recent paper noted that the high death rates seen in the north of Italy correlated with the highest levels of air pollution.\nThe new research, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, compared NO2 levels in January and February in 66 administrative regions with Covid-19 deaths recorded up to 19 March. Ogen also assessed the atmospheric conditions to see where pollution was being trapped over the regions.\nHe found that 78% of the 4,443 deaths were in four regions in northern Italy and one around Madrid in Spain. These five regions had the worst combination of NO2 levels and airflow conditions that prevented dispersal of air pollution.\nOgen noted that the Po Valley in Italy and Madrid were surrounded by mountains, which helps trap pollution, as is Hubei province in China, where the pandemic began. “However, my research is only an initial indication that there might be a correlation between the level of air pollution, air movement and the severity of the course of the corona outbreaks,” he said.\nProf Jonathan Grigg, from Queen Mary University of London, said the study showed an association between Covid-19 deaths and NO2 levels. “This association could reflect a causal link between exposure to air pollution and increased vulnerability to fatal Covid infection, but other factors cannot be ruled out at this stage. For example, the study does not adjust for differences in age distribution in different areas.”\nWidespread lockdowns around the world have led to reduced vehicle traffic and air pollution. However, long-term exposure to dirty air before the pandemic may be more important than current levels of pollution.\nIn the UK, NO2 has been at illegal levels in most urban areas for the last decade. A key policy to reduce NO2 levels is the introduction of clean air zones, where charges are imposed to deter the most polluting vehicles from city centres. But the introduction of some CAZs has been postponed because of the coronavirus crisis.\nJenny Bates, an air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “This new study is worrying. We know NO2 is a toxic gas that inflames the lining of the lungs and reduces immunity to lung infections, so it may not be surprising that people who have suffered in areas with high levels of NO2 could be more susceptible to coronavirus.\n“This is all the more reason to keep traffic and pollution levels down as much as possible now and get out of this terrible situation with a view to fewer but cleaner vehicles on the road.”"}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/doctors_urge_flu_shots_before_epidemic_peaks_16_mortality_rate_among_patients_in_helsinki_region/11203467", "title": "Doctors urge flu shots before epidemic peaks , 16 % mortality rate among patients in Helsinki region", "text": "Doctors urge flu shots before epidemic peaks\nInfluenza season is expected to peak in March in the Uusimaa region, which includes Helsinki.\nThis winter's influenza season will become more active over the next few weeks, predicts Eeva Ruotsalainen, deputy chief physician of the infectious diseases division of Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH, also known as HUS).\n\"So far 19 people have been in intensive care or monitoring in the HUCH region. About 80 percent of them have had underlying conditions and were not vaccinated,\" she tells Yle.\nThree of this season's intensive care patients have died.\n\"The mortality rate is 16 percent, which is quite high. On an annual basis, the mortality rate of patients in intensive care or being monitored for influenza varies between 10 and 20 percent,\" she explains.\nRuotsalainen particularly urges those in risk groups to get flu jabs from their local health centres. The risk groups are small children, people over age 65, pregnant women and anyone with an underlying serious disease. It takes about two weeks for the inoculation to provide full protection.\n\"The influenza season is expected to reach its height in March, so there is certainly still time to get vaccinated,\" she says.\nProtection against four viruses – but not novel corona\nThe Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has imported about 1.7 million injection doses of influenza vaccine to be administered free of charge to those in risk groups and their immediate circles, as well as 116,000 doses for children in the form of a nasal spray.\nRuotsalainen says that some 700,000 injection doses remain unused.\n\"About 1.03 million shots have been administered around the country,\" she says. \"At the moment about half of those over 65 have been inoculated, along with about a third of children under age seven.\"\nThe seasonal flu shot is a quadrivalent, meaning it provides protection against four different flu viruses that are now circulating in Finland and elsewhere in the world, but these do not include the new form of coronavirus. Only one case of that illness has been confirmed in Finland.\n\"It protects against two A viruses and two B viruses. For instance, one of them is AH1N1, a progeny of swine flu that is now circulating as a seasonal flu, and seems to be proliferating here in Finland this season,\" says Ruotsalainen.\nEDIT 11.2.2020: The headline on this story originally suggested there was a 16 percent mortality rate from flu in Helsinki.

The headline read: with China accused of major coronavirus cover-up as chilling satellite pics 'show extent of corpse burning in Wuhan’.\nThe Daily Mirror used a question mark.\nBut both suggested that these high levels of SO2 could have come from an unusual crematorium activity in both cities. Other media followed suit.\nThe claim pushed China's air quality office to issue a statement via China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment.\nIt said: \"After careful confirmation, we found that the SO2 rise published by windy.com was a 'serious distortion' and its statistics could not be trusted.\"\nAccording to their data, a concentration of between 4 and 8 μg/m3 was recorded on Sunday and not 1,300 μg/m3 as shown by the application.\nWhere did the sulphur dioxide claim come from?\nA tweet from Twitter account @inteldotwav, with just over 16,000 followers, posted a thread including what looked like an impressive image on February 8.\nIt claimed to show dangerously high levels of SO2 near Wuhan and Chongqing.\nThe person behind the tweet left interpretation of what the high levels of SO2 meant open to the reader,\nIt was suggested it could be a power plant, burning garbage or animal carcasses, and \"the third and most morbid: that bodies are being burned on the outskirts of the city, that the numbers of victims are much higher than what the Chinese Communist Party is reporting, and that things are really, really bad.\"\nThe tweeter confirmed he saw the rumours on the internet and decided to do his own \"investigation\". However, his method proved to be misleading.\nIn recent days, some media have reported that Wuhan's crematoria are operating 24/7 based on an interview with an employee, interviewed reportedly obtained by The Epoch Times, a conservative and anti-communist media of the Chinese community in the US. Other experts outside China also question the accuracy of the official death toll.\nSo what's the truth?\nIt is true that data on windy.com shows extremely high levels of SO2 in both cities.\nBut little or nothing allows us to establish a relationship with the alleged unbridled activity at the city's crematoria.\nSulfur dioxide is naturally emitted by volcanoes. According to the WHO, the main human source of SO2 emissions is the combustion of sulphur-containing fossils used for domestic heating, electricity generation and motor vehicles as well as the burning of waste and the decomposition of organic matter.\nModels used for forecasts are not \"satellite measures\"\nThe data on windy.com is not based on satellite images, as claimed by the Sun tabloid newspaper in its headline.\nInstead, they are based upon forecasts based on NASA's GEOS-5 model, which, according to the US agency itself, often give significantly higher results than observations.\nThe models are not updated to take into account episodes like the coronavirus. They're based on \"emissions inventories\", for example, the probability of pollution levels based on known sources of emissions.\nThey take into account the usual sources of emissions of an area: factories, power and heating plants, and cross-references them with meteorological variables. In other words, NASA would have had to introduce a \"burning human bodies in crematoria\" parameter. This is very unlikely.\nNASA has not responded to Euronews' requests for comment on this.\nThis type of forecast uses satellite data, but, in general, satellites are not able to detect small sources of sulphur dioxide such as factories or crematoria. They do accurately measure more intense phenomena such as volcanic eruptions.\nSo, if there were an intense, unusual emissions activity due to crematoria, it wouldn't be shown on these models.\nWuhan and Chongqing always have high levels of SO2 using the NASA model\nThe earth.nullschool application uses the same GEOS-5 NASA model. But it also has an archive of measures. At random, we went to February 14, 2019 - long before the world knew about the existence of a new type of coronavirus - and obtained even more impressive values of 1,583 µg/m3.\nThe values change depending on where we place the cursor.\nThe same goes for Chongqing, where, at random, we get levels of over 1,000 μg/m3 last year, or even in 2018.\nThis means the \"forecasts\" of these platforms are an interesting and useful indicator, and, certainly, Chongqing and Wuhan suffer from poor air quality, but this is approximative data to be taken into perspective, not a scientific measure or proof.\nAn Italian chemistry professor has made a rough calculation for the website open.online, and he estimates that to get to those levels of SO2 Wuhan would have to burn about 30 million bodies. That's unlikely, to say the least.\nFactories and atmospheric conditions\nExperts consulted by Euronews believe that the levels observed are not particularly alarming in one of the world's most polluted country.\nThey say that high concentrations in a particular place may be related to atmospheric conditions. Indeed, last weekend in Wuhan it was cold, about 4-5 degrees — increasing the probability of people using heating — and not very windy, which can increase concentrations.\nEast of Wuhan, where the large cloud of SO2 was shown, there is a large coal-fired power plant that is identified in NASA's catalogue of sources of sulphur dioxide emissions, as researcher Iolanda Ialongo told us.\nAnu-Maija Sundström, an air quality expert from the Finnish Meteorological Institute, pointed out that at a quick glance, neither the air quality indices nor the SILAM model showed anything exceptional in the SO2 levels of Wuhan.\nIn short, this looks like just another more example of the difficulty of separating rumours and misinformation in a subject as sensitive as the coronavirus. Many take advantage of the traditional opacity of the Chinese authorities to multiply the most gruesome speculations.\nThe World Health Organization itself or the major social networks and Internet platforms have created special pages to try to stop false rumours about COVID-19."}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/sars-hong-kong-and-singapore-ready-for-covid-19-46444868-2550-4d90-ab92-a3cc90635cb4.html", "title": "The hard experience of SARS made Hong Kong and Singapore ready for coronavirus", "text": "SARS made Hong Kong and Singapore ready for coronavirus\nA teacher in Hong Kong shows students hand hygiene during the SARS outbreak in 2003. Photo: Tommy Cheng/AFP via Getty Images\nDespite their proximity to China, Hong Kong and Singapore have managed to keep COVID-19 infections and death extraordinarily low.\nWhy it matters: As coronavirus cases surge in parts of the U.S., it's natural to look at the examples of cities that have handled the disease better. But the single most important factor may be something the U.S. can't replicate: the experience of the SARS outbreak in 2003.\nThere's no shortage of reasons Hong Kong and Singapore have had such success in containing COVID-19. Both cities are rich, with strong public health care systems and a deep bench of infectious disease experts. Both cities were quick to restrict travel from China, to check and quarantine visitors with symptoms and to rapidly trace contacts of any confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n- But the deeper reason lays not in today's success, but in past failure that remains very real for the roughly 13 million citizens of these two globally-connected cities.\nFlashback: In 2003, Hong Kong was the epicenter of the SARS outbreak, suffering 298 deaths from the disease, second only to mainland China. Singapore experienced the fifth-most cases of the disease, with 32 deaths.\nThose numbers, though, only tell part of the story. I lived and worked as a journalist in Hong Kong during SARS, and what the city experienced during the spring of 2003 was every bit as terrifying and paralyzing as what is happening now.\n- In the early days of the outbreak, SARS burned through Hong Kong's hospitals, infecting dozens of health care workers and ultimately killing nine of them. Hong Kong was also the only city that experienced a widespread public outbreak of the disease, when 329 residents in the Amoy Gardens apartment complex contracted SARS.\n- During the worst period of the outbreak, Hong Kong experienced a shutdown nearly as total as those caused by COVID-19, with people shunning restaurants and public spaces, schools closed for weeks and the city's usually bustling airport all but stilled. Unemployment hit an all-time high of 8.5% in the waning days of the outbreak.\n- Singapore weathered the outbreak better than Hong Kong, but still experienced a GDP drop of 0.47%.\nThe memory of SARS is burned in the minds of ordinary Hong Kongers and Singaporeans, as well as the city's doctors and leaders.\n- When reports began surfacing in January of a mysterious respiratory disease in China, Hong Kongers began taking steps of their own, wearing masks in public and increasing hand-washing and disinfection.\n- Many Americans are already bristling under the restrictions put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 — or even doubt the danger of the pandemic altogether — but the experience of SARS has made Hong Kongers and Singaporeans more willing to sacrifice convenience and the economy for public health.\n- “While in many places, the general public tends to regard outbreaks, more or less, like a television fantasy or brief news item, in Hong Kong, the public take outbreaks, and recommendations about what to do, seriously,\" Keiji Fukuda, the director of the University of Hong Kong's School of Public Health, told the Atlantic this month.\nThe bottom line: There is plenty for the U.S. to learn from Hong Kong and Singapore's response to COVID-19. But if the most important point is that experience is the best teacher, we may be in for painful lessons."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/opinion/sunday/corona-virus-usa.html", "title": "Opinion | Weve Ignored the Warnings About Global Pandemics", "text": "Back in 2002, when the SARS virus made its fateful leap from bats to civet cats to humans, global health experts warned that the ensuing outbreak was a harbinger of things to come: Climate change and globalization were conspiring with an array of other forces to make it much easier for old animal diseases to morph into new human ones. It was only a matter of time before one of those diseases proved truly catastrophic. The world could avert the worst consequences if it started planning.\nBut SARS was quickly contained (in part because the virus itself was so deadly that it was easy to detect). The disease faded from public consciousness and, with it, any sense of urgency over future outbreaks.\nIn 2009, when swine flu first emerged in the United States — scientists later traced the virus to pig farms in Mexico — experts warned again that a longer-term game plan was needed, one that was proactive rather than reactive. Again, headlines and hand-wringing followed. Again, the outbreak proved mild and passed quickly. Again, the world and its leaders moved on without heeding the warnings.\nThe panic-then-forget cycle was broken briefly in 2014, when Ebola tore through West Africa. President Barack Obama created a new office and established a special emergency fund to improve federal response efforts. His administration also launched a global initiative meant to help high-risk, low-income countries prepare for future outbreaks. By 2018, that progress had been undone. The office was disbanded and the funds were rescinded, even as a second Ebola outbreak emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nHere we are again. In December, another new virus — SARS-CoV-2 — made the leap from animals to humans. It has now infected more than 83,000 people across more than 50 countries. Nearly 3,000 people have died, most of them in China where the outbreak began. Global health experts are once again sounding the alarm. It’s unclear how bad things might get this time around. Covid-19, the disease caused by this new virus, appears to be between seven and 20 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which on average kills between 300,000 and 650,000 people globally each year. But that fatality rate could prove to be much lower, especially if it turns out that many milder cases have evaded detection.\nIn the meantime, this much is not in dispute: SARS-CoV-2 spreads easily — more easily than SARS or seasonal flu — and is tough to detect. It’s the kind of virus that would be extremely difficult to contain even in a best-case scenario, and the world is hardly in a best-case scenario now. Rising nationalism, waning trust and lingering trade wars have undermined cooperation between global superpowers. Rampant misinformation and growing skepticism of science are imperiling public understanding of the crisis and governments’ response to it.\nIn the United States, a coming general election has politicized what should be a clear public health priority. On Tuesday, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, warned that a global pandemic was all but inevitable and asked the American public to brace itself for impact. That same day, her boss’s boss, President Trump, insisted that everything was well under control.\nMr. Trump has requested from Congress only $2.5 billion to address Covid-19 — far less than the $15 billion that experts say is needed. He has also made some curious personnel choices in recent days: putting Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the federal response, and muzzling Dr. Anthony Fauci, the long-serving director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Dr. Fauci has guided the nation through just about every outbreak and epidemic since 1984, and is widely recognized as one of the world’s foremost authorities on managing such crises. As governor of Indiana, Mr. Pence badly botched the response to an H.I.V. outbreak, which resulted in hundreds of preventable infections.\nThere is still a chance that Covid-19 will prove to be more fire drill than actual fire. A global pandemic is all but certain, but there are many unknowns: Will the virus itself prove to be less contagious or far less deadly than is currently feared? Will it show a tendency to recede in warmer weather the way that seasonal flu does? Can a vaccine be made quickly available? (Dr. Fauci says that one may be ready for testing in as little as two months, and could be commercially available in about a year.) Any of these developments may yet break the global transmission chain, and the vortex of fear and market-tumbling anxiety in which the world now finds itself may yet pass.\nIf the next few weeks or months bring calm — and scientists increasingly worry that they will not — the world would do well to remember this time what it seems to have forgotten again and again. Another pathogen will emerge soon enough, and another after that. Eventually, one of them will be far worse than all its predecessors. If we are very unlucky, it could be worse than anything in living memory. Imagine something as contagious as measles (which any given infected person passes to 90 percent of the people he or she encounters) only many times more deadly, and you’ll have a good sense of what keeps global health officials up at night.\nHere’s what is certain: Despite many warnings over many years, we are still not ready. Not in China, where nearly two decades after that SARS outbreak food markets that sell live animals still thrive and authoritarianism still undermines honest and accurate communication about infectious diseases. Not in Africa, where basic public health capacity remains hobbled by a lack of investment and, in some cases, by political unrest and violence. Not in the United States, where shortsighted budget cuts and growing nationalism have shrunk commitments to pandemic preparedness, both at home and abroad.\nTo be sure, some broad progress has been made in the past few years. Vaccine development and deployment now proceed faster than at any point in history. The World Health Organization has corrected many of the institutional shortcomings that thwarted its responses to previous outbreaks. Other countries, in both Europe and Africa, have stepped up to fill the global health leadership position that America appears to have vacated.\nBut, as Covid-19 makes clear, much more is still needed.\nPlan and prepare. The national stockpile has only a fraction of the personal protective equipment that may be needed to respond to Covid-19 — or that would be needed in any pandemic situation. The Food and Drug Administration says that Covid-19-related supply chain disruptions have led to at least one drug shortage already. Public health experts say that more will almost certainly follow. Federal officials, responding directly to the Covid-19 crisis, have also apparently failed to adhere to even the most basic principles of infection control. Americans expect more from their government. Experts have been warning about the importance of proper training, and the need to plan for equipment shortages and supply chain disruptions since at least the anthrax scare of 2001.\nInvest in state health departments. They are the front line of every public health emergency, from vaping-related lung illnesses to resurgent syphilis to the opioid epidemic to Covid-19. They are underfunded and deeply strained, and the vast majority of them do not have the capacity to respond to a full-blown pandemic. They cannot do the work of rapid diagnosis and contact tracing, or promote public awareness and combat misinformation in real time, without financial and human resources. A 2019 reauthorization of The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, which includes state-level funding for public health emergencies, was a step in the right direction, but it was not enough to compensate for nearly two decades of steady funding cuts.\nFund federal health agencies. To wage the best fight against any pandemic, the country needs more than vaccines and medical supplies. It needs reliable diagnostics, advanced disease monitoring systems and sensible drug development. One of the most reliable ways to develop those things is through federal research and development. It’s disconcerting that for every fiscal year of his presidency so far, Mr. Trump has called for deep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. He has also scaled back or shut down programs meant to study infectious diseases and prevent outbreaks in developing countries — including ones aimed at finding viruses like Covid-19 before they make the leap to humans.\nForget isolationism. One thing the current moment shows is the folly of presuming that viruses will respect borders — that they can be kept out by walls or wrangled into submission with good intentions. They cannot. Restricting and rescinding foreign health and development aid, pulling global health workers from outbreak zones abroad and undermining health care at home makes Americans more vulnerable to threats like Covid-19.\nThe best strategy for thwarting this epidemic, and for preventing the next, is to help other nations — wherever they are — fight humanity’s common enemy over there before we have to fight it over here.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Olsen Cruise Lines said in an emailed statement that it had reported “a small number of influenza-like cases on board. Our medical team has now advised that they are all feeling better. No guests or crew are, or have been, displaying symptoms that are considered to be consistent with those of coronavirus.”\nOfficials said the ship was carrying 1,128 passengers and 384 crew members. The cruise line said it was “awaiting advice on the next steps” and “liaising with a number of airlines to secure onward travel for guests.”\n“It is our opinion that this is an overreaction by the Dominican Republic,″ Fred. Olsen said in a written statement.\nThe cruise line’s website shows the ship had been due to pick up another load of passengers and set off on a new cruise Thursday night.\nThe company said Friday that “we are in discussion with the relevant authorities on nearby Caribbean islands, as well as a number of airlines, to enable our guests to disembark and secure onward travel for them to return home.”\nThe Dominican Republic’s public health minister, Rafael Sánchez Cárdenas, said the ship already had been barred by another port, which he did not specify.\nMeanwhile, passengers on another vessel at the Mexican island of Cozumel faced yet another day on board after their ship was turned away from ports in Grand Cayman and Jamaica.\nThe MSC Meraviglia docked at Cozumel on Thursday. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said passengers would be allowed to disembark.\nLópez Obrador said Mexico had to act with “humanity” after the ship was refused authorization by the two other nations due to virus fears.\nBut Alejandra Aguirre, the health secretary of the coastal state of Quintana Roo, said two people had been detected with acute respiratory infections not believed to be the new coronavirus and that other passengers wouldn’t be allowed off until tests on those two came back later Thursday.\nThe two were identified as a 27-year-old male crew member from the Philippines and a 30-year-old female passenger from France.\nMSC said in a statement that the two passengers were now symptom-free and the ship would remain in Cozumel. Assuming clearance to disembark is given, passengers would be free to tour Cozumel through the end of Friday.\nThe cruise line had expressed frustration with the rejections, which came after it reported the crew member was sick with common seasonal flu.\n“The ship is being allowed to dock and the passengers, those who are aboard the cruise ship, can disembark,” López Obrador said, adding that health inspections will be carried out.\n“We cannot act with discrimination,” he said. “Imagine if a ship arrived and it wasn’t even allowed to dock, and they were told, ‘Keep going on your way, see where you can dock.’ That is inhuman.”\nHe added “we cannot close our ports, nor can we close our airports.”\n“Imagine the desperation and everything it implies, almost 5,000 people on a ship and they cannot get off,” he said. “Why such backward attitudes?”\nThe case of the Meraviglia illustrated the crisis of nerves over the COVID-19 virus. Mexico has no confirmed cases and MSC Cruises said the crew member had only common seasonal flu, had been placed in isolation and had “nearly recovered.”\nLocal media showed a small knot of Cozumel residents near the cruise ship dock demanding that passengers not be allowed to disembark, citing fears about potential contagion or effects on the tourism-dependent economy.\nPassenger Eder Ortíz told Hechos Meridiano Quintana Roo, a local newscast affiliated with national broadcaster TV Azteca, that inside the boat people were protesting to demand they be let out.\nOrtíz, who was traveling with his wife to celebrate their second anniversary, said no illness was circulating despite the fact that passengers were co-mingling in pools, dining areas and dance spaces.\n“Nobody is infected,” Ortíz said.\nJust minutes after López Obrador spoke Thursday, the governor of the Quintana Roo state, where Cozumel is located, confirmed the ship had docked, but said “no authorization has been given” yet for passengers to disembark.\nGov.

One Texas man’s penchant for online fame and vanilla ice cream cost him 30 days in jail and a $2,000 fine.\nFor Mr. Pfister, the deodorant-licking prank turned into a serious police investigation. He was charged by the prosecuting attorney’s office in Warren County with making a terrorist threat in the second degree, a felony.

When I spoke with Wendell Potter, a former communications director at the insurance giant Cigna, on Thursday, he had a succinct explanation: The health-care system in the United States is built for the elite.\n“We hear politicians say all the time that we have the best health-care system in the world,” Potter, now a leading advocate for Medicare for All, told me. “We have fabulous doctors and health-care facilities, but they’re off-limits to a lot of people because of the cost.”\nBut what is off-limits to some is readily available to others—namely the wealthy, powerful, and connected—through a combination of front, side, and back doors.\nThere are the obvious reasons: Wealthy people tend to have better health-care plans and are more able to pay out-of-pocket expenses than poor people are. And then there are the ethically dubious reasons: The powerful—such as politicians—can leverage their position of influence, and the wealthy can donate their way into faster treatment.\nNearly a decade ago, when Shoa L. Clarke, a cardiology fellow at Stanford University, was a medical student, he noticed something odd. There was a patient who had a red blanket on their bed. He didn’t think much of it at first, but the significance of the blanket quickly became clear. “It was a marker of status,” Clarke wrote inThe New York Timesin 2015. “At that hospital, patient relations gave them to some C.E.O.s, celebrities and trustees’ friends.”\nI spoke with Clarke yesterday to see if anything was different in our current environment, and though he allowed that some hospitals had started limiting the practices he had described, these patterns still occur. “Most of the major hospitals in the country have some strategy now to not just recruit patients in general, but to particularly recruit patients who are relatively well insured,” he told me. “Often, hospitals are specifically recruiting international patients to fly over and pay out of pocket.”\nThere are some practical reasons for hospitals to do this, he said. Several hospitals have closed in recent years, and by bringing in patients who can pay more—and by giving them luxurious treatment to keep them—hospitals can keep the lights on. But as Clarke emphasized five years ago, that’s “vaguely unethical.”\nThe ethics of preferential treatment are even more acute as the country stares down a pandemic. “What we’re facing right now is unlike anything that I’ve ever experienced in medicine,” Clarke told me. “Our motivations should be driven by public health … and for folks who are coming in potentially with COVID-19, it doesn’t matter if they’re a CEO of the big tech company or a homeless person off the street—they need to be appropriately cared for.”"}, {"url": "https://news.err.ee/1074390/tests-at-tabivere-social-center-confirm-five-coronavirus-cases", "title": "Tests at Tabivere Social Center confirm five coronavirus cases", "text": "Tests at Tabivere Social Center confirm five coronavirus cases ({{contentCtrl.commentsTotal}})\nThree residents and two employees of Tabivere Social Center have tested positive for the COVID-19 coronavirus, Tartu Municipal Mayor Jarno Laur (SDE) confirmed on social media on Tuesday.\nDuring Friday's testing, one resident tested positive; on Tuesday, four residents had to be transported to hospital, at least two of whom have contracted the virus, Laur explained.\n\"Thus I can confirm that at least three of our residents are corona-positive.

But they are poorly paid, ill-prepared and vulnerable to attacks and social stigma, reports BBC Marathi’s Shrikant Bangale.\n“The value of our life is just 30 rupees [less than $1], according to the government,” says Alka Nalawade, a community health worker in the western state of Maharashtra.\n“The government is paying us 1,000 rupees ($13; £10) a month for corona-related work,” she adds. “That is 30 rupees daily for putting our life in danger.”\nMs Nalawade is among the state’s 70,000 Ashas, short for Accredited Social Health Activists. She is a single mother, and has been doing this job for 10 years now in Pawarwadi village, where she lives.\n- India's race against time to save doctors\n- The children struggling to survive corona lockdown\nAshas are drawn from local and largely rural communities, and are a crucial element in India’s primary and community health programmes. They go door-to-door educating people about maternal and child health, contraception, immunisation and sanitation, as well as enrolling them in health programmes and monitoring the results.\nTheir role in the fight against Covid-19 is not that different - they visit the homes they have been assigned, educate families about isolation, and monitor people for symptoms of the virus. But the risk is far greater than anything they have faced before.\nFor one, they don’t have the right gear, including masks or sanitiser. India is facing a severe shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), and even doctors and nurses are unprotected.\nSeveral Ashas told the BBC that they use cotton masks which they wash daily so they can re-use them - and for sanitiser, they have a bottle of spirit that they mix with water. One of them, Karuna Shinde, says she carries a scarf with her, which she uses to cover her face.\n“Wherever there is lack of safety equipment, we have instructed the local administration about it,” says Rajendra Yadravkar, Maharashtra's junior health minister.\n“Ashas have been putting their lives in danger on a meagre salary. They should be protected. It’s the government’s responsibility to support them.”\nBut this doesn’t reassure the workers or their families who often discourage them from going to work.\n“My husband insists that I shouldn’t go to work. He says other people such as nurses and doctors get paid a proper salary, let them do this work,” says Ms Shinde.\nApart from the fear of infection, families are also concerned about safety as there have been reports of health workers being attacked in different parts of the country.\nAnd yet, Ms Nalawade says, the compensation - a monthly wage of 1,000 rupees - does not reflect the dangers she and her colleagues face.\nShe says she would earn 10 times her salary if she worked as a daily-wager on a farm. “How are we supposed to meet our household expenses with 30 rupees?” she asks. ‘‘What if I get infected with the virus? Who will look after us? Will I get treated for 30 rupees?”\nShe says they also face stigma for simply trying to do their job - people often stop them from entering their homes and make them stand outside while answering their questions for fear that the Ashas may infect them.\n“We are working for the people, but if the same people are going to behave with us this way, what are we supposed to do?” asks Ms Nalawade.\nThe women also complain that they receive little recognition for their efforts.\n“Nobody even mentions our work,” says Anjana Wankhede. “From the prime minister to the chief minister, everybody only praises doctors and police.”\nShe says that’s unfair since the government relies on the data that Ashas collect daily.\n“We visit each and every household and provide these numbers to the government. The government talks based on these numbers, but they don’t talk about the Ashas who collect the numbers.”"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/health/coronavirus-flu-season-deaths.html", "title": "The Fear of Coronavirus and Flu Colliding in the Fall", "text": "Could the United States face two epidemics at the same time next fall, flu and the coronavirus?\nThat frightening idea was raised by Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during an interview on Tuesday with The Washington Post. He suggested that a new surge in coronavirus cases could coincide with the next flu season, causing an even more difficult crisis than the one the nation is facing now.\n“We’re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time,” he said.\nAt Wednesday’s White House briefing, President Trump said that Dr. Redfield had been misquoted and would clarify his remarks. But Dr. Redfield then said that The Post had quoted him correctly. But he tried to dial back the alarm his comments had provoked.\n“I think it’s really important to emphasize what I didn’t say,” Dr. Redfield said at the briefing. “I didn’t say this was going to be worse, I said it was going to be more difficult and potentially complicated.”\nHe reiterated several times that if the situation became more difficult, that did not mean it became worse.\nHe added: “The key to my comments and the reason I really wanted to stress them was to appeal to the American public to embrace the flu vaccine with confidence. One of the greatest tools we have as we go through the fall-winter season is to get the American public to embrace the influenza vaccine and thereby minimize the impact of flu to be the other respiratory disease we confront.”\nMr. Trump said, “We may not even have corona coming back.” He continued: “If it comes back, it won’t be coming back in the form that it was, it will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain. What the doctor was saying, and I spoke to him at great length, he was saying if it should come back, you have the flu and the embers of corona, but in my opinion from everything I’ve seen, it can never be like anything like we witnessed right now. It’s nothing like — what we’ve just gone through, we will not go through.”\nEpidemiologists and infectious disease experts interviewed before the Wednesday briefing doubted that the virus would go away, and did not rule out the prospect of a worse crisis in the fall if the two diseases strike at the same time.\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S.\n- The White House will wind down the coronavirus task force in coming weeks.\n- Kushner’s volunteer force prioritized medical supplies from Trump’s allies.\n- Comparing recent deaths to historical figures hints at real toll in each state.\n“When flu season comes, there is the possibility that we will be dealing with two respiratory viruses at the same time — flu and Covid,” Dr. Thomas Frieden, the former head of the C.D.C. and the president of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit focused on disease prevention, said in an email. “This could be a double challenge for our health care systems.”\nEven if social distancing and other mitigation measures succeed in “flattening the curve,” once those strictures are loosened, cases could surge again, Dr. Frieden said.\nNew flares in Japan and Singapore, where the disease had appeared to be under control, have made it clear that the virus may retreat but does not disappear.\n“The end game with this virus is, it’s going to try to infect as many of us as possible,” Dr. Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said in an interview. “With the transmission characteristics we’ve seen, this is a virus that’s going to require at least 60 to 70 percent of population to be immune, from being infected or by vaccination, for substantial reduction of transmission.”\nHe added, “We have a long ways to go yet.”\nDr. Frieden’s analysis was similar: “Covid-19 is likely to continue to circulate until there is a vaccine. That means we need to be ready to reimpose distancing if cases threaten to overwhelm health and public health systems.”\nMost experts agree that a vaccine is at least a year or more away, at best.\nThe C.D.C. did not respond to requests for more information in time for publication.\nDr. Osterholm said there was a widely held misconception that if new cases start to diminish, people can go back to work, the downswing will continue, the disease will go away and life will go back to normal.\n“We don’t know what it’s going to do,” he said. “Like gravity, it’s going to keep trying to pull us down.”\nThere is no evidence that the warming temperatures of spring and summer will get rid of the disease, a scientific panel told the White House this month, noting that the virus was spreading rapidly in countries with hot weather, including Australia and Iran. Some laboratory studies have found that high temperature and humidity could lower the ability of the virus to survive, but the studies were not conclusive, according to the report, which came from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, independent agencies that advise the government and the public.\n“Generally, there are respiratory viruses, including flu and some common cold coronaviruses, that are seasonal,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview on Tuesday, before Dr. Redfield’s comments were published. “They do much better in winter and seem to taper off in summer. We do not know at all whether that will be a factor with this virus. There are indications it may not be the case.”\nHe added: “With warm weather, like in Singapore, they’re having outbreaks when it is warm. It is conceivable that on the basis of mitigation alone as we happen coincidentally to get into May, June, July, and it goes down, people may think it’s weather, but it’s the mitigation.”\nDr. Fauci described the ability of the virus to spread as “exquisite.” Both in the interview and in the briefing on Wednesday, he said that the nation would still be dealing with the coronavirus in the fall. He said he expected a resurgence then.\n“It could be mini or it could be a big blast,” he said in the interview. “We better be prepared with a real clear adequate amount of tests and all the hospital things you need if you get an outbreak.”\nDr. Frieden said it was possible that the steps taken to stop transmission of the coronavirus would also limit spread of the flu, but he said it was way too early to predict what the next flu season would be like or to say for sure whether there would be overlapping epidemics.\n“The only thing predictable about flu, as Dr. Anne Schuchat of C.D.C. taught me, is that it’s unpredictable,” Dr. Frieden said.\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]"}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/coronavirus_spreads_in_finnish_care_homes/11297042", "title": "Coronavirus spreads in Finnish care homes", "text": "Coronavirus spreads in Finnish care homes\nEight residents in a North Savo care home have died after being diagnosed with coronavirus.\nCoronavirus appears to have spread in Finnish care homes, with eight residents in one home in North Savo dying after being diagnosed with Covid-19, and nine in Helsinki homes also passing away.\nBoth staff and residents have been infected in the North Savo home, with all the deceased very old residents of the home.\nHealth authorities say that those with coronavirus have been isolated, and all the chains of infection in the region have been identified.\nAll staff members have been tested, with some still waiting for the results.

Experts Say Trump Administration Coronavirus Response Was Never Going to Work", "text": "The Trump Administration’s strategy to combat COVID-19, the novel coronavirus, began with a relatively simple focus: keep it out of the United States. In service of that goal, the White House issued drastic travel restrictions, imposed mandatory quarantines, and repeatedly told the public that these steps were working.\n“We have contained this. I won’t say airtight but pretty close to airtight,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in a television interview on Feb. 25, echoing Trump’s tweeted declaration that the virus was “very much under control” in the United States.\nBut it wasn’t, and the administration’s rosy messaging was fundamentally at odds with a growing cacophony of alarm bells inside and outside the U.S. government . Since January, epidemiologists, former U.S. public health officials and experts have been warning, publicly and privately, that the administration’s insistence that containment was —and should remain—the primary way to confront an emerging infectious disease was a grave mistake.\nRelated\nSign up for our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking on this link, and please send any tips, leads, and stories to virus@time.com.\nIn congressional testimony, in medical webcasts and in private discussions with health officials, they warned that the unique features of this flu-like virus made it impossible to control, and that the administration must use any time that containment measures might buy to prepare the country for an inevitable outbreak. The administration was using all its resources to blockade the doors, they warned, but the enemy was likely already in the house.\n“The current U.S. policy to deny visas to travelers from China and to quarantine returning Americans is not the right approach,” Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and expert in disease outbreak detection and response at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, testified to Congress on February 5. “I am deeply concerned that these measures will make us less safe by diverting public health resources from higher priority disease mitigation approaches.”\nTwo days earlier, former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb had warned “we have to assume it’s already here and circulating.”\nWhen it finally became indisputable that an outbreak was underway in Washington state, the administration was slow to catch up. There were not enough COVID-19 testing kits, hotlines were overwhelmed, and hospitals and public health departments were hobbled by a lack of reliable statistics on the spread of the disease. Experts say the U.S. response is now likely weeks—if not months—behind schedule.\nOn Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence, who is spearheading the White House response to the virus, cast doubt that the administration would be able to fulfill its promise to deliver one million testing kits by the end of the week. “We don't have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate the demand going forward,” he said.\nCOVID-19 first emerged in December in China’s Hubei province, where more than 80% of the 95,000 known cases have since been identified. By January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency, and moved quickly to cancel flights from China, ban non-U.S. citizens who recently visited China from entering the U.S., and quarantine Americans who had recently visited China’s Hubei province.\nThat initial strategy was not without validity, epidemiologists and former U.S. health officials tell TIME. Those measures likely helped to slow the spread of the virus. The problem, they say, is that once it was clear that the virus was within our borders officials did not pivot quickly enough to changing circumstances.\nAnd those new circumstances, experts told TIME, were entirely predictable. In a world linked by tens of thousands of flights a day, it’s nearly impossible to completely contain the transmission of an infectious disease like COVID-19, in part because people carrying the virus do not necessarily show symptoms. An effective response, experts say, would have required that administration officials capitalized on the temporary delay of new infections offered by containment strategies in order to aggressively prepare for inevitable outbreaks. But n ot one of the dozens of experts, doctors or former public health officials who spoke with TIME thought that the Trump administration used that delay effectively.\nRelated\nThe problem, they say, is partly that the administration misallocated limited resources. By being told to focus on monitoring a small number of quarantined travelers returning to the U.S., public health departments were not fully engaged in preparing mitigation efforts in communities, where we now know the virus was already infecting more people. Healthcare workers could have used that time to coordinate with hospitals, track suspected cases, funnel resources to diagnostics, prepare vulnerable populations, like nursing homes, and promote mitigation measures, such as isolating known cases outside of a hospital.\nInstead, the administration telegraphed that such mitigation work would only be necessary if containment failed. “Community mitigation work is not a failure, and part of the problem is not recognizing that,” Nuzzo tells TIME. “Sending the message that we are stopping this at our border, keeping this from coming in from China, has a psychological impact not on just on the American people but on practitioners as well.” The President’s repeated assertions that the containment strategy was working also diminished the sense of urgency, causing delays in community preparedness, public health experts and doctors told TIME.\n“Quarantines are intended to buy us time. Did we make good use of the time? No—and now we’re hustling,” says Steve Morrison, the director of the CSIS global health center and a former State Department official who served in the Clinton administration.\nThe Trump Administration only last week began authorizing disease surveillance within major American cities, where the medical community has been blind for weeks to the expanding number of new cases. Additionally, the drive to quarantine individuals from certain countries—China, Italy, Korea—discounted those from other nations, where the virus was also being transmitted. Taken together, the federal government’s singular focus on containment came at the expense of a more comprehensive—and more effective—approach, Nuzzo said.\nIn ideal circumstances, infectious disease experts tell TIME, the government would also have focused on mobilizing capacity to test for COVID-19 prior to the first reported case on U.S. soil. It would have sent test-kits to hospitals and clinics around the nation to identify any new infections and, armed with that data, officials would have tailored a rapid response, issuing public recommendations on sanitation practices, when to seek medical treatment, and how to limit the spread of the disease.\nInstead, public health departments in some parts of the country were blindsided. As experts predicted a month ago, some state coronavirus hotlines and hospitals have been overwhelmed.\nThe administration's failure to quickly disseminate enough working COVID-19 test-kits has also had lasting repercussions, likely exacerbating the spread of the disease and robbing public health officials of vital data about the spread of the virus.\nBecause medical professionals have been forced to limit the number of tests administered, there is no clear picture today of how many people, including those with mild symptoms, have been infected. (Until recently, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised that tests only be administered to those who had known exposure to someone with the virus, travel history to an affected region or had symptoms of a serious respiratory illness. ) It's unclear how many, Americans contracted COVID-19, but only had mild symptoms, and so were not tested and quarantined. It's also unclear how many other people those patients infected.\nThe CDC is struggling to gather state testing data, which isn’t being publicly shared, on where COVID-19 outbreaks are occurring or how many Americans total have been infected. A new genomic analysis by the Seattle Flu Study suggests that COVID-19 has likely been spreading in Washington state since mid-January, weeks before the U.S. implemented travel and quarantine measures.\n“Given the features of this virus, we knew from the onset that it’s not the type of virus that is amenable to containment,” says Luciana Borio, who served as director for Medical and Biodefense Preparedness at the White House National Security Council from 2017 through 2019 and as chief scientist for the Food and Drug Administration. “And that only works if you use the time really wisely. It’s possible that the time that it bought us wasn’t used in the best possible manner to help us get ahead of the curve in terms of preparing the homeland for the eventual epidemic.”\nRelated\nPublic health and infectious disease experts have been urging the Trump administration to take actions to mitigate an outbreak for more than a month. As early as Jan. 28, Borio, along with former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, began publishing op-eds highlighting the ways the U.S. healthcare system needed to prepare. The first one was titled “Act Now to Prevent an American Epidemic.” They warned that more cases in the U.S. were inevitable, that the CDC would struggle to keep up with the volume of screenings, and that hospitals and public health workers needed to prepare for an influx of patients. While U.S. containment measures could stall an outbreak, they wrote that officials needed to start testing patients with symptoms who had not traveled to China.\nSeveral former government officials also warned Congress in early February to resist the temptation to focus on travel bans and restrictions from affected areas. “Congress should press the administration for the science behind recently announced quarantines….and inquire as to the effectiveness of the measures being implemented,” Ron Klain, who served as Ebola response coordinator under President Barack Obama, told Congress on Feb. 5. He called the travel ban a \"band aid.\"\nOther former U.S. officials have put it more bluntly, calling the administration's focus on restricting flights and quarantining travelers the “original sin” of the Trump administration’s response. “The containment strategy was doomed from the start,” says Jeremy Konyndyk, who directed USAID’s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance during the Ebola outbreak and is a member of the World Health Organization committee overseeing health emergencies.\nThe containment measures were meant to buy the Trump administration time to move aggressively, but they didn’t do that, Konynkyk added. “What did you do with the delay?” he tells TIME. “If you buy time, you need to use that time to prepare. It’s insane to me that they’re still harping on containment and travel controls and keeping the disease out when that is not going to be the driver of transmission at this point.”\nEven as the coronavirus spread from Asia to Europe, Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and North America, and tracking and quarantining travelers became increasingly ineffective, the White House doubled down, insisting that containment was working. For weeks, both the President and administration officials repeatedly claimed that the decision to impose travel restrictions and quarantines was the reason for the low number of cases, and that the media and Democrats were exaggerating the threat. In fact, the low number of cases appears to be due to the fact that very few people were being tested for the disease.\n“We have had tremendous success, tremendous success, beyond what people would have thought,” the president said at a Feb. 27 press conference in which he often appeared to contradict his own administration’s health officials. “At the same time, you do have some outbreaks in some countries—Italy and various countries—are having some difficulties.”\nTwo days later, the administration increased travel restrictions on South Korea, Iran and Italy, and a man in Washington state—who had not been to any of those countries—became the first to die of COVID-19 on American soil.\n“Every state should be in the middle of mitigation planning at this point,” says Paul Biddinger, director of the Emergency Preparedness Research, Evaluation and Practice Program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “It’s an urgent need. Everything we’ve seen indicates this disease will be widespread within weeks, not months.”\nOnce it became clear that the crisis was unavoidable, the administration should have pushed harder, Nuzzo says. “What was missing was the sense of urgency. They were still so mentally focused on ‘we just have 15 cases.’”"}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/04/news-from-russia-what-you-missed-over-the-weekend-59-a70175", "title": "News From Russia : What You Missed Over the Weekend", "text": "Doctor down\nA third Russian doctor has fallen from a hospital window after he filmed a video in which he complained of being forced to work despite contracting coronavirus and facing a shortage of protective equipment.\nAlexander Shulepov, 37, is reportedly in critical condition with a fractured skull in a Voronezh region hospital 500 kilometers south of Moscow.

Yet that civilization is vulnerable to COVID-19, which can only be fought by decoupling the connections that underpin the modern world.\nCOVID-19 is, ironically, a function of the richer, more connected and more populous world created by the defeat of disease.\n- Medical technology like artificial ventilators will keep the death rate from COVID-19 lower than in past pandemics like the 1918 flu.\n- But the social distancing needed to slow its spread will exert a much worse economic toll than it would have a century ago because our much larger economy is far more dependent on global trade and uninterrupted human connection.\n- \"Globalization is both a vulnerability and a reason why our response to this, even with all the economic pain, will be much more effective than it was in the past,\" says Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and the author of a forthcoming book on the history of disease.\nBackground: For most of humanity's history, disease and infection kept a check on human development. Population growth, economic growth, even the spread of people across the planet — all were curbed by the threat of contagion.\n- As late as 1800, average global life expectancy was just 29 years. This wasn't because human beings couldn't live to an old age but because almost half of all people born died before their 50th birthday, mainly from contagion.\n- Death from disease in urban areas was so rampant that up until the 19th century, cities were only able to maintain their population through a constant influx of migrants to replace the dead.\nAll that began to change in the 19th century, with the sanitary revolution and later the widespread development of vaccines and antibiotics.\n- Untold numbers of lives were saved. Global life expectancy rose — to 71 years on average today — and with it, global population.\n- Freed from the constant reaping of their citizens from infection, cities exploded, their larger populations becoming engines of rapid innovation. Global travel became safer and with it, the global trade that has helped drive startling levels of economic growth over the past century.\n- \"Our defeat of infection overcame the barriers to human development,\" says Kenny.\nYes, but: That defeat has been so total that we often take it for granted, especially in the developed world, where we are far more likely to die from heart attacks or strokes — conditions human beings rarely lived long enough to suffer from — than infectious disease. As a result, we've let our guard down.\n- Global vaccination rates have stagnated and declined for diseases like measles in recent years, partially driven by anti-vaxxers who have no memory of a world threatened by childhood diseases.\n- As antibiotic resistance grows because of overuse, we desperately need new drugs. Yet in January the World Health Organization warned the pipeline for new antibiotics was essentially dry.\n- And of course the explosive spread of COVID-19 has shown just how unprepared the world was for a contagious, new infectious disease.\nThe bottom line: The reason COVID-19 feels so disruptive is because our world was built on the idea that events like this no longer happen. We won't get that world back until we beat this disease. And we can't safeguard that world unless we ensure it won't happen again.\nGo deeper: The pandemic highlights the man-made disasters to come"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51770856", "title": "Letter from Africa : The spread of coronavirus prejudice in Kenya", "text": "Letter from Africa: The spread of coronavirus prejudice in Kenya\nIn our series of letters from African writers, Kenyan journalist Waihiga Mwaura reflects on how the coronavirus has fuelled anti-Chinese prejudice in his country.\nDespite the concerns around the spread of the coronavirus, the greatest enemy is not the virus itself, but \"fears, rumours and stigma\".\nNot my words, but those of the Ethiopian who is leading the global effort to lessen the impact of Covid-19.\nThe World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was responding at the end of last month to cases of anti-Chinese prejudice.

But this pandemic is likely to finish off many titles\n- Coronavirus – latest updates\n- See all our coronavirus coverage\nIt is the bleakest of ironies: the biggest news story in a lifetime is killing off the very industry that exists to report it. Coronavirus is destroying newsprint newspapers across Britain, delivering the coup de grace to businesses that were already in the process of dying.\nLocal and regional newspaper publishers have found it economically unsustainable to go on producing papers. In response, they have suspended the publication of scores of titles and placed hundreds of journalists on paid leave. “Furloughs” have become part of the new pandemic lexicon.\nAt national level, print runs have been drastically reduced because of distribution problems, most obviously resulting from the widespread closure of retail stores. Edition sizes have also been cut back due to the drop-off in advertisers. Similarly, many magazines are also forsaking print in favour of digital-only publication.\nAlthough formal announcements by publishers stress that their dramatic Covid-19 measures will be temporary, there is reason to believe some may be permanent. Newsprint, the transmission of news by ink on paper, might not recover from the contagion in what could eventually be seen as a transformational moment for the 380-year British newspaper history.\nThere will not be a post-pandemic “old media” recovery because it seems inconceivable that publishers, already struggling to fund journalism, will return to the previous status quo. That’s because the status quo was, itself, one of perpetual fragility in which publishers were engaged in the delicate task of managing newsprint decline while, in parallel, seeking to create a digital journalism business model.\nAs is well known, their central problem has been the failure to find any viable alternative to advertising as newspapers’ major source of revenue. Throughout the past 20 years, papers have defied forecasters who predicted that advertising income was on the verge of disappearing. Instead, it has lasted well enough to sustain newspapers, even though its decrease has necessitated severe cuts to editorial budgets and a consequent diminution in the quality and quantity of content.\nAdvertising’s surprising durability has been important because it enabled publishers to play circus performers – riding two horses at the same time to provide funds for both newsprint and digital platforms. But sensible newspaper owners, managers and editors have long realised that there would come a time when advertising would dry up, newsprint’s ever-decreasing audience would vanish, and they would need to find a way to fund digital journalism without ad support.\nThat there is a hunger for online news is undeniable. For the past month, every major publisher has been reporting record numbers of website visits. Page views each day have been off the chart. Dwell time, one of the key metrics to show the depth of reader engagement with individual articles, has increased, too. One result, according to some national publishers that impose charges for online access, has been a rise in subscriptions.\nTo put this in an even more positive perspective for newspapers, the expansion of interest in their content has occurred despite record viewing figures for TV and radio news and current affairs broadcasts. This interest is obviously due to coronavirus being, as everyone emphasises on a daily basis, an unprecedented event.\nWhat is not emphasised, however, is the certainty that its aftermath will also be unprecedented. Economic activity will surely be slower to revive than optimists, such as government ministers, would like us to believe. Indeed, it wasn’t in a healthy state prior to the shock of Covid-19.\nBy the time the lockdown ends – and that light appears to be a long way down the tunnel – many companies may not be in a state to recover. It is true that some could seek to revive their businesses through advertising; but financial constraints on potential consumers, because of depleted income during the emergency, will make the outcome of such initiatives uncertain.\nPost-lockdown, publishers will be reassessing the state of their businesses. Aside from the difficulties they face in winning back advertisers, they will need to make rational decisions about their bottom lines. Did the closure of this or that title really matter? How much money did we save by publishing fewer newsprint issues? Do we need expensive offices when our papers have been so effectively produced by journalists operating remotely?\nIn mid-March, that wise historian, Peter Hennessy, conveyed the epoch-making significance of the pandemic during a BBC Radio 4 interview. Future historians, he said, will divide our age into BC and AC: “Before corona and after corona.”\nI am convinced media analysts will make the same division. AC will likely mark the final stage in newsprint’s long decline."}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/10_deaths_at_mehilainen_nursing_home_in_espoo/11320634", "title": "10 deaths at Mehiläinen nursing home in Espoo", "text": "10 deaths at Mehiläinen nursing home in Espoo\nTwo-thirds of Covid-19 deaths in Finland’s second-largest city have been at a single nursing home.\nYle has learned that 10 residents of an Espoo nursing home have died due to coronavirus infections.\nThe Huvilaharju facility is run by Mehiläinen, a private social and healthcare provider.\nEspoo’s Deputy Mayor and Head of Social and Health Services, Juha Metso, confirmed to Yle that all corona-related nursing home fatalities in the city have taken place at Huvilaharju.\nThe Regional State Administrative Agency of Southern Finland is looking into the home’s operations, says its social services inspector, Sari Husa.\nThe agency received a complaint about Huvilaharju on 5 April, the day that Yle reported on the first Covid-19 death there.\nMetso said that Huvilaharju has followed the national guidelines on protective measures.\n“There is no indication that operations there have been more careless than anywhere else,” he said.\nMetso says that city officials first inspected the nursing home before Easter.

Compliance with treatment guidelines and agreed criteria is assessed on a random basis.\n\"Whatever these results are, we get confirmation that they have either been well treated or there have been shortcomings.

But the flu has a vaccine — and a dedicated plan to increase vaccination rates could avert a magnified disease crisis.\nThe same social distancing put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 also seems to have brought an early end to this year's flu season. If those efforts continue into the fall and winter, \"it's likely to help us somewhat with the flu as well,\" says William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\nThe catch: If social distancing in some form remains in place — as many experts believe it will — it may prove difficult to distribute the flu vaccine.\n- Health officials have reported drastic drops in childhood immunization rates this spring, with uptake for some vaccines falling by more than 70%. That's due to many doctor's offices temporarily closing because of COVID-19, along with fears from parents that bringing children to open health clinics could expose them to the coronavirus.\n- \"As states look to reopen their economies, it is crucial that they open up healthcare services as well for vaccinations,\" says Besser.\nRegardless, it's almost certain COVID-19 and flu will be circulating at the same time this fall, says Richard Besser, CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \"That makes it important to plan now for how we will deal with both outbreaks simultaneously.\"\n- The flu on its own puts tremendous pressure on hospitals each year — last year's season resulted in nearly 500,000 hospitalizations, especially among the same elderly cohort that is most at risk from COVID-19. \"We must use this time to prepare for that,\" says Tom Frieden, former U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director and president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives.\n- The most important step Americans can take is to ensure they get vaccinated for the flu this year, which will offer them some individual protection and reduce the strain on the health care system.\nBackground: Each year from roughly November to April, circulating influenza strains infect people in the Northern Hemisphere. (The flu season timing is reversed in the Southern Hemisphere.)\n- A new flu vaccine is produced each season because flu strains mutate, but the vaccine is never a perfect match for the virus. This season's flu vaccine was 45% effective, according to an interim report from the CDC, on the low end of its usual range.\n- In part because the seasonal flu vaccine is imperfect, and in part because less than half of American adults get vaccinated, influenza takes a major toll on health — the CDC estimates more than 35 million people were sickened and more than 34,000 died in the 2018-19 season.\nWhat to watch: Assuming an effective COVID-19 vaccine can be developed, the world will need to produce hundreds of millions of doses, if not far more.\n- Some experts are worried vaccine manufacturers may hit production limits that force them to choose between a new COVID-19 vaccine and existing vaccines for diseases like the flu.\nThe bottom line: The annual misery of the flu season is the closest thing medicine has to a sure thing. Doctors will need to be on guard — and Americans will need to get their flu shot — to ensure that influenza doesn't make a bad COVID-19 pandemic even worse.\n'"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/live/uk-northern-ireland-52507022", "title": "Coronavirus in NI on 6 May", "text": "There have been a further 14 deaths related to Covid-19 reported by the Department of Health, taking their total, mostly comprising of hospital deaths, to 418.\nThree of the deaths happened since Tuesday.\nThese figures are one of two sets published in Northern Ireland - the other are weekly statistics from statistics agency Nisra, which cover all fatalities where coronavirus has been recorded on the death certificate.\nBy 24 April Nisra had recorded 393 Covid-19 related deaths here."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51946837", "title": "Coronavirus : Tourists quarantined on cruise ship Aidamira off South Africa", "text": "Coronavirus: Tourists quarantined on cruise ship Aidamira off South Africa\nSouth Africa is holding more than 1,700 people on a cruise liner and a cargo vessel off the coast of Cape Town because of coronavirus.\nA crew member of cargo ship MV Corona is suspected to have the virus.\nHe had been on a flight with six other people, who then boarded Italian-flagged cruise liner MV Aidamira.\nSouth Africa has 116 cases of coronavirus and President Cyril Ramaphosa has declared a state of disaster, restricting travel.\nNearly half - 35 out of 72 - of South Africa's land border crossings were closed on Monday, along with two of its eight sea ports.\nThe MV Aidamira, with 1,240 passengers and 486 crew on board, had returned to Cape Town from Namibia’s Walvis Bay.\nThe ship is mainly carrying German and Austrian nationals, though other nationalities are also thought to be on board, reports the BBC's Pumza Fihlani from South Africa.\nHealth authorities say they are awaiting coronavirus test results from six people on the cruise liner.\n\"We are prioritising the testing,\" health ministry spokesman Popo Maja told the BBC.\nNone of the passengers or crew on the cruise liner are reported to be displaying symptoms of coronavirus, according to a spokesman for the company.\n- LIVE UPDATES: Follow the latest developments here\n- EASY STEPS: How to keep safe\n- A SIMPLE GUIDE: What are the symptoms?\n- NEW MEASURES: What is the UK advice?\n- TRAVEL PLANS: What are your rights?\nThe MV Corona left Cape Town on 11 March but the ship’s master requested to return after the patient started to show symptoms of the virus, news agency Reuters reports.\nThe crew member has since been placed in isolation on-board the MV Corona, along with another crew member who was on the same flight from Turkey.\nAuthorities are working on tracing all the people the suspected cases came into contact with.\nMeanwhile, all schools in South Africa have closed from Wednesday.\nForeigners travelling from badly affected countries are also barred from entry into the country.\nThe concern is that the virus may spread fast in poor, crowded neighbourhoods."}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-swiss-politics/swiss-environmentalists-demand-green-recovery-after-coronavirus-idUSKBN22G1G3", "title": "Swiss environmentalists demand  green recovery  after coronavirus", "text": "BERN (Reuters) - Environmental activists delivered a petition to a special session of the Swiss parliament on Monday demanding that a government aid package should promote a “green recovery” from the coronavirus crisis.\nWith some lawmakers wearing protective face masks, parliament convened at an exhibition centre rather than its normal building so members had extra space to maintain social distancing rules.\nCampaigners said the 62 billion Swiss francs ($64 billion) in emergency economic aid should be used in an environmentally friendly way.\nMore than 22,000 people signed the petition demanding that support for companies in sectors with large greenhouse gas emissions like aviation be tied to reducing their environmental impact.\nThe package includes 1.28 billion Swiss francs in loan guarantees for Lufthansa (\n“We are here because we want to make it a green recovery.

Her husband, Ted, ended up in the ICU. Chloe spent weeks in a race against a bottlenecked system, trying to donate her plasma to Ted and hopefully save his life.\n- Story by Erika Hayasaki\n- Family\nThe prayer beads hanging from Chloe Le’s rearview mirror trembled as she exited the I-15 freeway in Lake Elsinore, California, heading toward a drive-through COVID-19 testing center in the parking lot of Diamond Stadium. In better times, the stadium was used for minor-league baseball games and the city’s annual Halloween “Field of Screams.” Health-care workers stood before rows of white tents, covered from head to toe in plastic, as cars lined up.\nChloe turned off her YouTube Music playlist of Vietnamese tunes. She pressed her driver’s license against the glass of her car window, so a worker could jot down her name. Chloe knew the drill. She had been through this process twice already at this very site. Both of those COVID-19 tests had come back positive.\nIt was April 16. Chloe needed this third test to be negative. She believed that her husband’s life could depend on it.\nForty-three miles away, 32-year-old Ted Le, also diagnosed with COVID-19, lay intubated on a ventilator. He had been unconscious in the intensive-care unit at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center, in Los Angeles County, since March 24. Prohibited from visiting his bedside, Chloe had not touched him in 24 days.\nIn early April, Chloe began reading news reports about doctors performing experimental treatments using plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. The therapy hasn’t been proved to work, but survivors’ antibodies might help critically ill patients fight off the coronavirus. So across the country, hospitals and blood banks have been putting out calls for anyone who has recovered from COVID-19 to donate their plasma.\nRead: Why the coronavirus is so confusing\nNot enough plasma is yet available for all the patients who might need it. Positive COVID-19 test results can show up weeks after symptoms disappear, preventing donations. Survivors like Chloe who want to offer their plasma have had to wait or have been turned away because they did not meet eligibility requirements; others have been unable to donate because they have not yet built up enough antibodies. The controversial ban on gay men donating has prevented potential contributions as well.\nThe donor programs that Chloe had applied for required proof of a positive COVID-19 laboratory test and 28 days of being symptom-free. As of her third test, Chloe’s coronavirus symptoms, which included a mild fever, a runny nose, fatigue, and loss of taste, had ended 19 days prior—meaning she had nine more days until she could donate. A negative test would allow her to bypass that 28-day waiting period and donate sooner. If Chloe was coronavirus-free, she could offer her plasma to a blood bank as soon as possible, and request that it be routed directly to Ted.\nOnly a day before Chloe’s third test, Pomona Valley Hospital had received approval to administer the treatment. Now doctors could begin giving plasma to patients, but the hospital did not yet have any viable donors. Though many COVID-19 survivors had signed up wanting to give plasma, blood centers were still trying to sort out who qualified before setting up their donation appointments—and most still did not. Chloe had also posted pleas on social media, asking people anywhere (but preferably local) who had tested positive for the virus a month ago to come forward and help her husband.\nRead: All the things we have to mourn now\nAs Chloe pulled up to a health-care worker in the Diamond Stadium parking lot, I watched on FaceTime as she rolled down her window and tugged off her face mask.\n“Okay, my dear, I’m going to have you put your head back,” the staffer told her, holding the swab with blue-gloved hands. “I’m going to put it in your nostril, twirl it about five times. It’s going to be a little uncomfortable.”\nChloe tilted back, her seat belt still stretched across her chest.\n“Breathe through your mouth.”\nChloe’s jaw dropped. She winced.\n“One, two, three, four. You got it,” the worker said.\nChloe’s eyes watered. She put her hands on the steering wheel, her mask dangling off her left ear.\n“You’re going to get a phone call if it’s positive,” the health-care worker told her. “If it’s negative, you’ll get an email.”\nIt could take anywhere from three to 10 days to get results, the worker said. Chloe did not know if her husband would live that long.\nChloe always thought of Ted as invincible. He had no other health problems, had not smoked in many years, and did not use drugs. When Ted came home on March 17 from his job as a manicurist at a nail salon with a runny nose, Chloe did not immediately suspect COVID-19. But by the evening, Ted had a fever of 101. The next morning his temperature climbed to 103.\nTed, who also drove for Lyft and worked as a tattoo artist, did not want to go to the hospital, because his health insurance had lapsed. Four days passed. He lay in bed, moaning from body aches and a terrible migraine, his eyes bloodshot. Chloe begged her husband to visit a doctor. She told him he could get emergency Medi-Cal benefits through the hospital. By Monday, March 23, Ted could barely walk or eat. He had lost his sense of taste and was having difficulty breathing.\nAt Chloe’s insistence, Ted finally agreed to go. Chloe drove him to Pomona Valley Hospital, where she also works the graveyard shift as an admitting representative. She dropped him off in the front of the emergency room. Visitors are not allowed into areas with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.\n“Text me,” she told Ted. “Let me know when they discharge you.” She did not think he would be there very long.\n“They took almost 20 vials of blood,” he wrote hours after being admitted, sending a photo of himself with a face mask connected to a blue tube.\n“You have to get better,” she replied.\n“I have no energy left.”\n“Do you think you’re gonna make it?” Chloe wrote, growing more panicked.\n“Idk babe.”\nTed texted her on March 24: “They are going to transfer me to ICU.” It was the last time she heard from him before he was intubated.\nThat same day, Chloe drove to the coronavirus testing site in Lake Elsinore for the first time, along with her parents. Chloe and Ted’s 2-year-old son, Kendrick, came too. None of them showed any symptoms, but Chloe wanted them to get tested to be sure. The toddler sat calmly and didn’t even cry when the swab was inserted, just as it was for adults, sharply into his nose.\nRead: Should you get an antibody test?\nTed and Chloe lived in the same house as her parents. When the test results came back, Chloe and her 74-year-old father both were positive for the virus. But her 64-year-old mother tested negative, and so did Kendrick. Chloe’s mom and Kendrick moved out of the house, and into Ted’s mother’s home.\nChloe’s symptoms did not show up until five days later, and they turned out to be mild: barely a cough or sore throat. Meanwhile, her father remained asymptomatic. If it had not been for the severity of Ted’s illness, they probably would never have been tested or even realized they had contracted the coronavirus.\nIt made no sense to her, how Ted’s body could become so ravaged by the same illness that hardly bothered Chloe or her father. Or how the virus seemed to have avoided her mother and son completely, even though they had all five been living under the same roof.\nDays passed in isolation at home, as Chloe checked social media and awaited FaceTime calls from doctors and nurses. Her boss dropped off grocery bags of honey, tea, oatmeal, oranges, and toilet paper in front of Chloe’s home. Chloe’s sister-in-law left home-cooked chicken soup, vermicelli, and pho on her porch for Chloe to pick up. Outside her window, she saw neighbors taking walks. She saw vendors selling tacos in her neighborhood without masks.\nOn Saturday, April 11, while many people were preparing to celebrate Easter the next day, Ted’s lungs collapsed. Doctors stabilized him.\nTed’s physician updated her daily through FaceTime, while standing next to his bed. “Doctors cannot give me false hope, and I understand that,” Chloe told me. She understood that Ted was a priority to receive the experimental plasma treatment if any donations came in. The doctor told her that “he will do everything in his power to make sure my husband gets the plasma,” Chloe said. “He promised me that, and I trust him.”\nThe treatment, Chloe knew, was no sure fix. Complicating matters, Ted had blood type B positive. Chloe had blood type A. Only when no perfect match is available can a plasma donation occur with mismatched blood types—a rare but not impossible feat that may not be as medically effective. Chloe brushed aside these technicalities. This was one of the few things over which she felt she had some semblance of control. An act of love, and desperation.\nNationwide, more than 1 million people in the United States have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the COVID Tracking Project, launched by The Atlantic, which collects data on the outbreak in the United States. More than 180,000 individuals have recovered, according to the John Hopkins University tracker, and they could potentially become plasma donors for patients with the most dire cases. Yesterday in California, 4,616 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized, with 1,464 in intensive care.\nDoctors across the country have already begun treating coronavirus patients with “convalescent plasma,” which contains the antibodies that the immune system develops while the body is under siege by the virus. More than 5,000 patients so far have been infused with plasma through a national program under the Mayo Clinic.\nRead: My whole household has COVID-19\nOn the Facebook group Survivor Corps, daily stories of recoveries, illnesses, deaths, people wanting to contribute plasma, places to donate, and people who have already donated fill the message wall, interspersed with heartbreaking pleas: “My family and I are desperately searching for an O+ plasma donor in Tulsa, Oklahoma! My husband is in critical condition in the ICU at St Johns hospital here in Tulsa and has been on a ventilator for 12 days. This is really our last hope.”\nIt is too early to see widespread results from the plasma treatments, though in a couple of studies, patients have shown improvement. But these aren’t enough to prove that the plasma works for sure. It is not uncommon for people to get better on their own—regardless of experimental treatments.\nData from clinical trials will begin to emerge in the coming weeks. Until then, family members with critically ill loved ones can only grasp at the fleeting possibility of a chance.\nChloe is 31, her birth name, Ngoc Lam Nguyen. She was born in Vietnam and moved to California in 2010, after an aunt in the U.S. sponsored her family. Three years later, she met Ted. His family had been refugees from the Vietnam War living in the Philippines, where he was born and given the name Truong. When he was just three months old, his family relocated to the U.S., where he became known as Ted.\nThey married in 2015, and after their wedding Chloe posted a Facebook photo of the two of them, her in a flowing white dress and long veil, holding his hand, both of their backs to the camera as they stood watching the sunset over the ocean. She called him “babe” instead of Ted or Truong. His term of affection for her was “doggy face,” she said with a laugh, “because their faces are cute and funny.”\nIn 2017, Chloe gave birth to Kendrick. “My son loves his dad; they are like shadows,” she told me. “Whenever my husband gets home from work, he’s like, ‘Daddy’s home!’ He runs to hug him and sticks with him the whole night.” Each week, Ted had one day off of work. Chloe also worked a second job at a vision-care clinic, doing medical billing. Time with their son was precious. Ted usually spent part of his day off with Kendrick at Chuck E. Cheese.\nTwice, Kendrick had a chance to see his father, unconscious with tubes running through his nose and mouth, over FaceTime with Ted’s mom. “Daddy,” he said, looking frightened. “Hospital.”\nAs nurses held up an iPad during another conversation, Chloe told her husband: “You have to fight, because we are fighting for you; all the doctors and nurses are helping, trying everything they can. Your son misses you. You have to hang on and be strong.”\nThe week of Chloe’s third COVID-19 test, she was one of 500 people to complete the online survey to be a convalescent-plasma donor through the San Diego Blood Bank. Only 10 of them so far had met the basic criteria, which included being 28 days symptom-free and in good health, Mark Edmunds, its chief medical officer, told me.\nDonation appointments were under way, but no plasma had yet been sent from San Diego Blood Bank to COVID-19 patients. By April 15, the American Red Cross, for which Chloe also filled out donation forms, had collected enough plasma to serve just 80 to 100 patients across the country, according to Pampee Young, the organization’s chief medical officer of biomedical services. Hospitals had requested plasma for about 400 critically ill patients through its program. And then, of course, many more requests had been received by other blood banks around the U.S. “We have not been able to meet the need,” Young told me. “I think this is true of virtually all blood centers across the country.”\nRead: The false hope of antibody tests\nA donation from a single person could generate three to four doses—about 200 to 250 milliliters each—of amber-yellow plasma. When transfused into a patient, the plasma hangs from an IV bag alongside the hospital bed. It is infused through a peripheral vein in the arm, Edmunds explained. The process can take a matter of hours or less, depending on how the timer on the release pump is set.\nPlasma programs and blood banks are still waiting for an influx of donors as antibody tests, which could work as quickly as a pregnancy test, are distributed widely to the public. But so far, many of these tests have not been screened or approved by the federal government. Medical professionals have until recently focused more on testing the sick than on those who are asymptomatic.\nFrom her home, Chloe anxiously kept up with the news. She posted an article about antibody testing in L.A. County on her Facebook page. “It would help if we had the antibody test quickly,” she said, “to determine who else can be a potential donor.”\nOn the day of her third coronavirus test, Chloe found out she could go back to her job at the hospital, which had instituted a 14-day return-to-work policy for employees who had been ill but were now symptom-free. She hoped it would distract her from the distress. Returning to work, Chloe said, “is going to keep me sane.” She was put on the schedule for the next graveyard shift.\nThere was also another reason she urgently wanted to return. Although Chloe worked in an administrative area at the hospital, she knew exactly where the ICU was. “Maybe I can stand outside and look at him,” she said. “I know they won’t let me in the room.” She just wanted to be close to her husband, even if briefly. She wanted to look at him without the boundary of a touch-screen device.\n“I won’t know until I get there,” Chloe said. “I will need to wander around, and maybe I can sneak in.”\nHours after receiving her third COVID-19 test, Chloe drove to the hospital to drop off the paperwork required for her to return to work. She pulled out her hospital badge. Once inside, she made a beeline for the ICU. The nurses seemed surprised to see her. But no one tried to kick her out. Chloe stared at her husband through the window. A nurse tried to bring her a chair, but Chloe only wanted to stand.\nHe looked comfortable, she thought, but completely unaware of anything going on around him. This was the first time she had been in her husband’s presence in nearly four weeks. Could he sense that she was close? She had no idea.\nAt some point during the 15 minutes she stood there, Ted’s doctor found her. “He’s headed in the wrong direction,” the doctor told Chloe. “His kidneys are failing.” Chloe had been clinging to the idea of a plasma treatment, to some kind of miracle. Now she had a sinking feeling. “It was hopeless,” Chloe said. There was no way to hug him, to comfort him or ease his pain. “In the moment there was nothing I could do.” She went home and tried to fall asleep.\nAt around 1 a.m. the next morning, a hospital employee called Chloe. Her husband’s oxygen-saturation levels had dropped perilously low. “He could code anytime now,” the health worker told her.\n“Please save him if you can,” Chloe begged.\nAt 5:30 a.m., another call. Chloe told me the words she remembered hearing from the medical staff: “We couldn’t bring him back. His heart was already very weak. There was no oxygen in his blood. His skin was already blue.”\nTwo days had passed since the hospital had received approval to participate in the Mayo Clinic’s convalescent-plasma clinical trials. Still, it had not received any plasma. A day had passed since Chloe’s third COVID-19 test. Now Ted was gone. They had run out of time. Weeping and alone, Chloe clung to the phone as if it could give her a different answer. Outside, the sun began to rise.\nChloe knew there had never been any guarantee that the plasma would have worked, but she had held on to the prospect of the treatment with the wishful thinking that people pour into prayers. “They tried,” she said. “The system wasn’t fast enough to save him. He couldn’t wait.”\nRead: Notes from a videochat memorial\nHours after she lost her husband, Chloe was still in shock when she received a message from the coronavirus testing program through the Lake Elsinore site. “I logged in to my account and saw my lab results,” Chloe said. They had come back in just one day, much faster than her previous two tests. “I am negative for COVID-19,” she said. “I’ve been cleared.”\nOn the day of Ted’s death, a dozen coronavirus patients remained at Pomona Valley Hospital. “We’ve certainly been frustrated that we haven’t been able to access plasma,” Daniel Gluckstein, the medical director of infectious disease for the hospital, told me. Several patients at the time had been candidates for the convalescent-plasma treatment, Gluckstein said, as well as for other clinical trials—particularly for the antiviral medicine remdesivir, which has been linked to recoveries in emerging studies. Gluckstein said the hospital has not been successful in getting approved for that trial, despite numerous attempts. But last week remdesivir received emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration to treat severely ill patients. The drug is expected to begin arriving in hospitals this week.\nAs of Wednesday, the hospital was treating 14 COVID-19 patients, with three in intensive care. Six patients so far have received convalescent plasma. It cannot yet report if any of their conditions have improved, but a spokesperson confirmed that all of the patients who received the treatment are still alive.\nSome of the hospital’s earlier critical patients had also received hydroxychloroquine as part of clinical trials (which the FDA recently warned can cause dangerous heart-rhythm abnormalities). Gluckstein could not say if hydroxychloroquine had helped those patients: “I haven’t been personally impressed.”\nAll of these treatments, like the virus itself, are in uncharted territory. Some patients may have improved with or without them. Some might have died with or without them. With convalescent plasma, there are also ethical concerns. With so little available, should it first go to the very sickest patients who are already in intensive care, or to those not yet at that stage who may have a better chance at recovery?\nChloe finally had proof of a negative coronavirus test and could safely see her son again. That weekend, she held Kendrick and did not yet tell him that his dad was gone.\nBy Sunday, April 19, Chloe had started planning Ted’s services, which would take place at a funeral home that permitted 10 people at a time for visiting hours, with an open casket. At home, Chloe looked around the bedroom she had shared with her husband. His clothes hung in the closet, their wedding picture on the wall. “I don’t want to stay in this room anymore,” she said. Not without him. “I will need to find another place.”\nChloe still planned to donate her plasma. She wanted to give hope to someone else. Recently, she drove an hour and 30 minutes from her home to a blood bank in Ventura County, California. After she arrived, a health-care worker checked her blood. Chloe has long been anemic, and her hemoglobins, the iron-rich proteins in red blood cells that carry oxygen around the body, were too low.\nThe health-care workers worried that she might not recover safely after donating, and told her to try to boost her hemoglobin levels with high-iron foods or supplements. This, Chloe understood, could take a couple more weeks. It is hard for Chloe to accept that potential donors are still getting turned away because they are not yet eligible.\nShe knows that for these families and for COVID-19 patients, every day is crucial. Chloe’s next plasma-donation appointment is scheduled for May 13."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-use-telemedicine-to-minimize-contact-with-virus-patients-11583337283", "title": "Hospitals Use Telemedicine to Minimize Contact With Virus Patients", "text": "- Business\n- Health Care\n- Health\nHospitals Use Telemedicine to Minimize Contact With Virus Patients\nCaregivers make use of phone, interactive video and secure messaging\nHospitals and doctors have a message for patients who want to come in because of fears they might be infected by the novel coronavirus: Try the phone first.\nDoctor groups, hospitals and health insurers are increasingly steering people with mild or no symptoms toward initial visits conducted by phone, interactive video or secure messaging.

And the service sector in general has felt the impact of the crisis, particularly tourism and recreation sectors.\n\"Just a couple weeks ago we had very healthy companies that are now heading into a cash crisis,\" said Tatu Rauhamäki, director of industrial policy at Service Sector Employers Palta, the representative group for service sector businesses.\nPalta’s own survey of service sector firms found that ten percent of companies had already laid off workers due to the coronavirus crisis. Meanwhile about 60 percent of the companies said it was likely that they will eventually be forced to lay off or dismiss staff.\nFive day negotiations\nThe complex legal procedures involved in laying off employees in Finland have been relaxed for a three month period due to the crisis, following an agreement reached between government and labour market organisations.\nRedundancy and layoff negotiations typically take weeks to complete, but the durations of both kinds of talks have been shortened to five days of discussion.\nCompanies with fewer than 20 employees are not bound by such restrictions.\nRomakkaniemi said the shortened negotiation time could help to slow down the flow of layoffs, noting that there is no longer a need for businesses to announce layoff plans far in advance. Firms can therefore more easily monitor cash flows and their ability to stay afloat day-by-day.\nMeanwhile Palta’s Rauhamäki praised the government’s support to suffering businesses but also noted shortcomings.\nHe said if Finland wants to avoid layoffs, it would be important for the government to provide direct wage subsidies for laid-off workers as some Nordic countries have announced."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/NewMediaWire/78fae12f83d0a819dddfb80c8a6708ee", "title": "Todos Medical Announces Positive Data for Serology Point - of - Care Fingerprick Antibody Test Kits", "text": "Todos Medical Announces Positive Data for Serology Point-of-Care Fingerprick Antibody Test Kits\nRehovot, Israel - ( NewMediaWire ) - April 28, 2020 - Todos Medical Ltd. (OTCQB: TOMDF), a commercial in vitro diagnostics company focused on the development of blood tests for the early detection of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as point-of-care and lab-based tests for novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or COVID), today announced positive data for its Colloidal Gold point-of-care (POC) 2 to 10 minute fingerprick blood antibody test kits from a study of 71 patients with suspected COVID-19 infection (30 COVID PCR-Positive and 41 COVID PCR-Negative) admitted to the hospital. The data demonstrate that Colloidal Gold accurately distinguishes between COVID positive patients and COVID negative patients, as confirmed by PCR (Quest Labs), with sensitivity of 96.5% using fingerprick blood sample collection and specificity of 97.5% using fingerprick or venous blood sample collection.\n“These U.S.-generated data demonstrate that our Colloidal Gold test can detect COVID-19 in patients who have been confirmed positive or negative by standard U.S.-based PCR testing,” said Jorge Leon, Senior Medical Advisor for Todos Medical. “As we begin to understand the immunology of COVID-19 infections, and the pragmatic value of rapid point-of-care COVID-19 antibody tests in different medical settings, the most consistent finding is that IgG is upregulated early in COVID-19 patients after infection and for an undetermined time upon full recovery after the viral molecular test becomes negative.\n“Most other rapid serological POC tests in the market have so far been shown to be unreliable. A great number of countries, including the U.S., are developing strategies to begin to return their economies to work, and for that to be successful it is of the essence that we quickly determine who has recently been infected with COVID-19, so that policy makers and employers can prioritize the development and implementation of mass screening and related confirmatory COVID-19 testing programs to minimize the risk of viral spread. Since there are still several aspects of the biology of the immune response to COVID-19 that are not fully clear, such as whether recovered patients upregulate IgG antibodies that protect them from a possible re-infection, at Todos we are committed to ensuring that physicians fully understand what a positive or negative result from our test really means, so they can develop good clinical protocols. We will continue to innovate and validate new versions of these tests to improve the clinical utility of these serological assays as we develop more knowledge of the biology of this infection over time.”\n“Our Colloidal Gold test is now available for sale in the United States after the manufacturer notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of its intent to sell under Policy IV D of the FDA’s Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 during the Public Health Emergency,” said Gerald Commissiong, President & CEO of Todos Medical. “We are beginning to market antibody screening testing in combination with reflex PCR testing services to our healthcare provider clients. We believe the way in which these antibody tests should be used is in combination with PCR testing, and that the combination will be critical to make sure we stop the spread of the virus and begin to help put the U.S. economy back to work.”\nAbout the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus (COVID-19)\nCoronaviruses are a family of viruses that can lead to respiratory illness, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Coronaviruses can be transmitted between animals and people and evolve into strains not previously identified in humans. On January 7, 2020, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, and additional cases have been found in a growing number of countries worldwide. COVID-19 is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nAbout Todos Medical Ltd.\nHeadquartered in Rehovot, Israel, Todos Medical Ltd.

They would not have to speak to a health advisor or wait for a medical test result.\nThis would send a cascade of alerts to people they had recently been in proximity to, advising them to go back into self-isolation.\nThe experts say \"speed is of the essence\", and that delaying contact tracing by even a day from the onset of symptoms could make the difference between epidemic control and resurgence.\n\"There would be more people receiving notifications as a result of false warnings,\" explained Prof Christophe Fraser.\n\"But actually, it results in fewer days of people in self-isolation and quarantine, because the effect of suppressing the epidemic more quickly outweighs the risks in waiting for a test before the notification.\"\nThe over-70s have not been factored in, on the basis they would remain \"shielded\" by staying at home, he added.\nThe Oxford University academics are a mix of epidemiologists and ethicists advising NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - on what basis the contact-tracing app should be created. They are not involved in coding or designing the software itself.\nTheir model takes into account different age groups, household structures and movement patterns in an effort to try to maximise the number of people who could be allowed to freely move about once a contact-tracing app has been launched.\n\"We're looking at introducing the app towards the end of lockdown,\" Prof Fraser added.\n\"When you install it, it needs a few days to start recording data before it can be fully functional.\"\nThe group first published a paper about its work at the end of March.\nSince then, they have adjusted their model to take account of changing factors, including the fact that Covid-19's infection rate has been faster than they had anticipated.\nThey have also changed plans from using a system that relied on GPS location readings and scanning QR codes to one that exclusively depends on Bluetooth signals. This has been done to provide users more privacy, which in turn could encourage take-up.\nThe hope is that using the app, as well as other measures such as hand-washing and social distancing from vulnerable members of the population, will prevent a second peak in infections or the need for repeated national lockdowns.\nThe team estimates that 56% of the general population must use the app to halt the outbreak. Prof Fraser said that equated to 80% of all existing smartphone owners, based on data from Ofcom.\n\"That's a very ambitious target,\" the professor acknowledged.\n\"It's not something that would typically happen for a new app - even an incredibly popular one - but if we can explain that this is a public health intervention, that will be new and different.\n\"Some of my colleagues have... commissioned large surveys in multiple European countries including the UK.\n\"More than 80% of people surveyed said they were likely to or would install this app when it was explained in detail what it would be doing.\"\nEven if fewer people install the app, the team estimates that one infection will be averted for every one to two users.\nOpt-in app\nThe Oxford team suggests that use of the tool should be voluntary. However, this will pose a challenge.\nOn 20 March, Singapore became one of the first countries to deploy a voluntary contact-tracing app, TraceTogether.\nBut only about 12% of the population installed it, and after a spike in new cases the city-state introduced a lockdown on 7 April, which it termed a \"circuit-breaker\".\nTo further complicate matters, a small number of phones still in use in the UK do not support the Bluetooth Low Energy system required, making the target even harder to reach.\nProf Fraser said that officials were discussing giving smartphones to those without - or cheaper, wearable Bluetooth devices - in order to boost the number of citizens involved.\nNHSX is also keen to keep the app opt-in.\nBut some have already started exploring the implications of it becoming obligatory.\nInternet law expert Prof Lillian Edwards has drafted a law to safeguard citizens' rights that says:\n- any compulsion must be public, legitimate, necessary and proportionate to the public goal of defeating coronavirus\n- sharing of data for any purpose beyond defeating corona must require users' consent\n- a new Coronavirus Safeguarding Commissioner should act as watchdog\nOthers - including the cyber-security expert Ross Anderson and AI entrepreneur Kai-Fu Lee - have cast doubt over whether contact-tracing apps have any chance of success, and fear they could give \"false hope\" to politicians looking for a way out of lockdowns."}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/the-corona-pandemic-has-catapulted-many-artists-into-financial-crises/av-53046883", "title": "The corona pandemic has catapulted many artists into financial crises | DW News - latest news and breaking stories | DW", "text": "More and more German artists are being affected by the corona pandemic.

As a child in the early 2000s, he watched his fellow Brazilians compete in the world surf championships in Hawaii. They were known as “small-wave surfers”: scrappy but second-rate. Australians and Americans took home all the trophies.\nThat changed in 2014, when Mr Medina’s daring aerials and cut-throat competitiveness led him to victory. His generation, called “the Brazilian storm”, professionalised the sport. “Fifteen years ago,” says his trainer, Allan Menache, “you got out of the water and drank a beer.” Adriano de Souza, a Brazilian surfer who went pro before Mr Medina, introduced unprecedented discipline. Cross-training (eg, swimming and yoga) gave him and his compatriots an edge. English lessons helped them secure sponsorships. Last year, Brazil clinched its fourth win in six years.\nThe World Surf League (WSL) recently opened an office in São Paulo. Globo, Brazil’s largest television network, expanded its coverage of the sport in 2015 and made Mr Medina’s rags-to-riches tale into an on-demand film. More man about town than beach bum, the 26-year-old arrived at its premiere in January wearing a sleek blue suit, trailed by an entourage.\nSurfing will make its Olympic debut in Tokyo in July, and more amateurs are braving the waves than ever. The WSL is trying to attract new fans through sustainability and sexual equality: beach clean-ups follow tournaments and both sexes win equal prize money, though the pro tour has 34 spots for men and only 17 for women. In Brazil, “lots of parents are putting their kids in the water and hoping they’ll be the next Gabriel Medina,” says Alfio Lagnado, the owner of Hang Loose, a surfwear brand.\nBut the forces behind the Brazilian storm are weakening. The global surf industry is going through a slump. Quiksilver, a beachwear brand that once sponsored hundreds of athletes, filed for bankruptcy in 2015, after trying but failing to become a mainstream fashion giant just as the retail industry hit hard times. In 2019 Hurley, another surfwear maker, announced that it would dissolve its professional team. Big brands like Corona and Jeep are “more interested in profiting off superstars than building the talent base”, says Miguel Pupo, one of 12 Brazilian surfers on this year’s pro tour. The sport’s fate depends on sponsors’ farsightedness: using the fame of this generation to invest in the next.\nCaio Costa, a 15-year-old from Maresias, understands the precariousness of his chosen career. He trained at the Gabriel Medina Institute, which provides free coaching to talented adolescents. He plans to ask businessmen who holiday in Maresias for money to buy surfboards ($500) and plane tickets for qualifiers that will put him on track for the professional circuit ($15,000). He gazes at the ocean as rain begins to pelt the waves. A dozen young surfers scamper out, boards in hand. “We Brazilians make a huge effort,” he says. He hopes they can weather the storm.■\nThis article appeared in the The Americas section of the print edition under the headline \"The big break\""}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/ebdbf56585701c3e8a298c51368b810d", "title": "Iran reports 2 more deaths , 13 new cases of new coronavirus", "text": "Iran reports 2 more deaths, 13 new cases of new coronavirus\nTEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranian health authorities Friday reported two more deaths from the new virus that emerged in China and said the fatalities were from among 13 new confirmed cases of the virus in Iran.\nThe report by the semiofficial Mehr news agency came as Iranians voted in nationwide parliamentary elections. After authorities reported two earlier deaths this week, the death toll from COVID-19, the illness caused by virus, stands at four in Iran.\nSo far, 18 cases have been confirmed in Iran, including the four who died.\nThe spokesman of the health ministry, Kianoush Jahanpour, said the newly detected cases are all linked with city of Qom where the first two elderly patients died on Wednesday.\nJahanpour said the new cases were either from Qom or had visited the city recently. He said four of them have been hospitalized in the capital, Tehran, and two in northern province of Gilan.\nMinoo Mohraz, an Iranian health ministry official, said the virus “possibly came from Chinese workers who work in Qom and traveled to China.” She did not elaborate. A Chinese company has been building a solar power plant in Qom.\nIn Lebanon, Health Minister Hamad Hassan on Friday reported the Mediterranean country’s first case of the new virus.\nAt a news conference in Beirut, he said the patient was a 45-year-old woman who arrived Thursday on a flight from Qom. He said the woman was in “good health” and the ministry was also following up on the cases of two other people suspected of having the illness.\nThe woman and two other suspected victims were quarantined at the Rafik Hariri government hospital in Beirut.\nConcerns over the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, prompted authorities in Iran this week to close all schools and Shiite seminaries in Qom, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) south of Tehran.\nAlso, earlier news reports said Iran had recently evacuated 60 Iranian students from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicenter of the epidemic. The students were quarantined upon their return to Iran and were discharged after 14 days without any health problems.\nQom is a popular religious destination and a center of learning and religious studies for Shiite Muslims from inside Iran, as well as Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan and Azerbaijan. It is also known for its cattle farms.\nIran once relied heavily on China to buy its oil and some Chinese companies have continued doing business with Iran in the face of U.S. sanctions. Unlike other countries — such as Saudi Arabia, which barred its citizens and residents from traveling to China — Iran has not imposed such measures. But it has suspended all passenger flights with China for the past two weeks, allowing only cargo flights.\nIran’s civil aviation spokesman Reza Jafarzadeh said on Thursday that the “cargo flights, if necessary, are under supervision, and controls imposed by the health ministry are carried out.”\nIn Turkey, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said officials have started to screen travelers arriving from Iran at border gates and are refusing entry to anyone with signs of illness. He also said Iranians who have traveled to Qom in the past 14 days will be refused entry.\nThe new virus emerged in China in December. Since then, more than 76,000 people have been infected globally, in as many as 27 countries, with more than 2,200 deaths being reported, mostly in China.\nThe new virus comes from a large family of coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a cold. It causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath. It can worsen to pneumonia, which can be fatal. The World Health Organization recently named the illness it causes COVID-19, referring to both coronavirus and its origin late last year.\nThere have been few virus cases in the Middle East so far. Nine cases have been confirmed in the United Arab Emirates, which is a popular tourist destination, and one case in Egypt. Of the nine in the UAE, seven are Chinese nationals, one is a Filipino and another an Indian national.\nIran’s neighbor Iraq, which has reported no cases of the virus, took measures to contain it by suspending visas on arrival for Iranian passport holders and direct flights between the two countries.\nIraq’s top Shiite cleric weighed in, using his weekly sermon at Friday prayers to urge authorities to be prepared for any outbreak.\n“The level of preparations should match the level of the threat,” said Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, calling on officials to boost preparations to avoid the danger.\nAlso Friday, one of 11 Israelis who were flown home after being quarantined on a cruise ship in Japan has tested positive for the virus, the first case to be reported inside Israel, the Health Ministry.\nThe Israeli cruise ship passengers, who had all initially tested negative, arrived on a charter plane overnight. They were met by medics in protection suits and immediately taken to the Sheba Hospital near Tel Aviv, where they will be kept in quarantine.\nAnother four Israelis were hospitalized in Japan after testing positive for the virus. Israel has cancelled all flights to and from China, and is requiring Israelis returning from China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore or Thailand to be quarantined at home for two weeks.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Joseph Krauss in Jerusalem, Zeina Karam in Beirut and Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-german-lawmaker-calls-for-delay-to-eu-climate-targets/a-53094006", "title": "Coronavirus : German lawmaker calls for delay to EU climate targets | News | DW", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic's effects are expected to cause a deep recession in Europe and elsewhere.

The Bayreuth Festival 2020 has been called off, for the first time in its 144-year history due to an epidemic.

There's a silver lining though: it may only be postponed and not canceled altogether.\n-\nThe Bayreuth Festival canceled\nBollywood 'Oscars'\nThe International Film Academy has announced that it would be postponing its awards ceremony, also known as Bollywood's Oscars, due to fears over the coronavirus outbreak. According to official numbers, India has been until now relatively unscathed by the epidemic.

But in a world that has the technological capability that ours does, we have the power to mitigate those disasters through our preparation and resilience — or to make them worse through our failures.\nToday we can either directly see through technology a disaster coming or reasonably know our level of risk based on the experience of the past or the ability to model what's to come.\nWhat this means is that in the truest sense, no disaster is really — or only — natural. The toll a catastrophe takes, especially in human lives, now has as much or more to do with our preparation, response and level of wealth as it has to do with the strength of the event itself.\n- One example: The 2010 earthquake that hit Haiti had a 7.0 magnitude and killed at least 220,000 people, while another temblor that struck a much better prepared Chile a month later was far stronger, yet killed fewer than 600 people.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was entirely foreseeable, as I reported recently.\n- Yet by refusing to take that threat seriously, and even dismantling some of the response measures that were already in place, the U.S. effectively expanded its \"bull's-eye of risk\" for an infectious disease disaster.\nBe smart: What happens next with COVID-19 will have far more to do with the steps we take in the days and weeks ahead than anything to do with the virus itself.\n- The New York Times reported on March 13 that worst-case projections by the CDC had as many as 214 million Americans being infected and as many as 1.7 million dying.\n- But those projections assume that nothing would be done to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. The wide-scale canceling of social gatherings and distancing measures being put in place will almost surely bend that curve.\n- The apparent success of China and South Korea in curbing the outbreak, and places like Hong Kong and Singapore in preventing the disease from gaining a strong foothold in the first place, demonstrates the difference that action can make.\nWhat's true of the pandemic now will also be true of threats from megatrends that will only intensify in the future, like climate change. What we do to directly mitigate global warming and adapt to its effects will determine our level of risk.\n- Actions that make us more vulnerable — like building up development on coastlines that face rising seas or allowing vaccination rates for preventable diseases to fall — expand the bull's-eye of risk.\n- Mismanagement of a disaster while it occurs or immediately after it can make a catastrophe far worse, as we saw with Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\nThe bottom line: There's no such thing as a natural disaster anymore. Our ability to prepare and respond to what nature throws at us is our strength — or, should we fail to do both, our vulnerability.\nGo deeper: The new threat of unintentional coronavirus misinformation"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/03/14/entering-a-bear-market", "title": "Webfly - Entering a bear market | Finance and economics", "text": "IT MAY HAVE been lost amid the stockmarket panic but on March 9 America’s bull market turned 11 years old.

Bryant’s occupation is listed as “author, producer and athlete” while Gianna is listed as a “coach and student.” They were buried at Pacific View Memorial Park in Corona del Mar.\nThe Bryants and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash last month. The retired basketball superstar, his daughter and the other victims will be honored at a 24 February public memorial at Staples Center, where Bryant starred for most of his 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers. The date corresponds with the No24 jersey he wore and the No2 worn by Gianna, whose team was coached by her father.\nIt’s not yet known what caused the crash, which occurred while the helicopter was taking the Bryants and the others to a youth basketball tournament. A report by the National Transportation Safety Board issued last week stated there weren’t any signs of engine failure from the wreckage recovered from the crash site in Calabasas, northwest of Los Angeles. The pilot, Ara Zobayan, had nearly navigated the helicopter out of blinding clouds when it turned and plunged into a mountainside.\nAt a public memorial Monday, several thousand people mourned three of the other victims: Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife, Keri, and their daughter Alyssa, Gianna’s teammate.

The company, which in the past helped build such successful e-commerce sites as Kylie Cosmetics, the $1.2 billion dollar beauty brand founded by Kylie Jenner, has registered nearly 500 new sites over the past two months with names that include “corona” or “covid,” The Times found. Untold others have been started using other names.\nOne of the new sites marketed an “oxygen concentration” machine for $3,080. Another had the “Corona Necklace Air Purifier,” which for $59 claimed to provide “All Day Protection.” A third offered a $299 pill that promised “Anti-Viral Protection” for 30 days. And sites such as CoronavirusGetHelp.com and test-for-covid19.com marketed home test kits for $29.99 to $79, none of which have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\nMany of the sellers do not actually possess the goods, nor have they verified that the products are legitimate. Often, the sites’ operators are middlemen who fulfill customers’ orders by buying items on other websites — a kind of digital arbitrage known as “dropshipping.” Shopify is attractive to these new businesses because its software can integrate the sites with the distant vendors, mostly in China.\nAmy Hufft, a Shopify spokeswoman, said the company last week closed more than 4,500 sites related to the virus. She said sites that did not back up the medical claims they made were suspended from the platform. By Monday, nearly all the sites identified by The Times had been removed.\n“Our teams continue to actively review Covid-19 related products and businesses, and stores that violate our policies will be immediately taken down,” she said in an email.\nGibril Bachouchi, a 20-year-old Canadian engineering student in Algiers, told The Times in a video call how he started his Shopify site, killcoronavirus19.com.\nMr. Bachouchi said he created the store to raise money for a hospital where his aunt works as a doctor, after hearing it was short on face masks and other equipment. His site advertised the $3,080 oxygen machine last week, and a Covid-19 testing kit for $30.40, among other products.\nLatest Updates: Economy\n- Latest projection: A deep recession and ballooning unemployment in Europe.\n- A stock rally is flagging in Europe.\n- How my boss monitors me while I work from home.\n“I was just like, ‘I’m a 20-year-old kid — what can I do to help a bit?’” Mr. Bachouchi said.\nHe watched videos on how to start a Shopify business, he said, and used the Shopify platform to log in to AliExpress, a Chinese retail site similar to eBay. He selected the oxygen concentrator and the testing kit from the Chinese site because they were among the “hottest-selling items,” he said. “You click a product you like on AliExpress and then it’s just on your website.”\nMr. Bachouchi said he used Shopify’s algorithm to set competitive prices and choose a markup; he said he chose 10 percent, though other resellers were typically charging 25 to 33 percent. As of last week, he had made no sales.\n“Shopify pushes you to spend as much as you can on marketing,” Mr. Bachouchi said. “I just don’t have the money.”\nA spokesman for Alibaba, the owner of AliExpress, said that medical testing kits were previously allowed under their policy “but given the current environment, we have made the decision to prohibit suppliers from listing Covid-19 testing kits.”\nMike Schmidt, founder of the digital marketing platform Dovetale, said the Shopify sites were emblematic of both the ease and the risks of setting up an e-commerce business. “It becomes much more accessible to sell things around Covid,” he said, cautioning that “there’s no verification label on these stores. There’s no one saying this is a trusted supplier.”\nThough Shopify has been policing the new sites, it also encourages its customers to go into the dropshipping business. It offers a guide for starting such a business and makes money from them by charging a monthly fee and a percentage of sales. The Canadian company is one of the largest turnkey e-commerce sites in the world, bringing in $1.5 billion last year. In February, Shopify announced that it had hosted over a million businesses.\nNew sites selling coronavirus products come online every day. A majority of the sites tracked by The Times appeared over the past two weeks, including over 70 registered since Wednesday, according to data from DomainTools, a cyberforensics company. The sites target users around the world and are in English, French, Spanish, German, Romanian, Icelandic and other languages.\nThe registrations are part of a larger increase in Coronavirus-related activity, said Chad Anderson, senior security researcher at DomainTools. In February, he said, he saw about 100 new websites a day related to the pandemic. Now, the figure is 2,000. Their systems have flagged about half of those as likely related to malware, ransomware or phishing.\n“It’s a massive uptick,” Mr. Anderson said.\nThe operator of another Shopify dropshipping site, covid-defender.com, who would identify himself to The Times only as Radwan, said he lived in Denmark and had run Facebook ads for his site. The site sells face masks for $30 to $40, including one marketed for children described as “Kid Mask Protection Against Virus and Bacteria With N95 Standards.”\nHe said he believed the supplier’s statements that the masks were certified to the standards claimed. “It doesn’t say by any means that it provides 100 percent protection,” he said.\nHe said he had not heard of shortages of the masks he sold. “If I had heard of any shortage anywhere on the planet I would not sell it,” he said. Even so, he said, it was up to his customers to vet the products before buying.\n“They shouldn’t trust these stores, and they have to find the proper information themselves,” he said.\nRadwan’s and Mr. Bachouchi’s sites were among those that were no longer available as of Friday.\nLike Radwan, many other Shopify sites were advertising on Facebook last week, as well as on Instagram, despite bans on such ads. The social platforms are lifelines for the shops, representing the primary way of generating sales. Similar ads have also appeared on Google, as CNBC reported.\nThe Facebook page “Coronavirus Test Kit” ran ads last week saying “Check whenever necessary at the comfort of your home! 🏠 Protect yourself and your family 👪.” It pointed to its website, which sold one blood test for $19.99 or 500 for $1,329.99. The site said, next to a photo of a blurry document, that the tests met certain European safety standards.\nThe Times found nine other Shopify sites that had run advertisements seeming to violate Facebook’s recently announced bans on price gouging and ads that create “a sense of urgency.” After The Times sent information to Facebook about the site selling Covid-19 testing kits, the company announced it was banning all such ads. In a statement, Rob Leathern, Facebook’s director of product management, said the ads The Times identified had been removed for policy violations and the company was “ramping up” its automated enforcement system.\nBut sellers are finding other ways to advertise.\nOne site, LuxuryWildSpot.com, which sells anti-coronavirus face masks, pays influencers to promote its pages on Instagram.\nThis can be cheaper than traditional ad buys — allowing posts to reach millions for as little as $30 — and also harder for the platform to police since they often appear as regular posts. And while Federal Trade Commission guidelines require accounts to identify sponsored content, these rules are often ignored.\nLast week, posts showing videos of people convulsing, being wheeled into ambulances or being decontaminated appeared on at least four Instagram accounts as a part of a paid influencer campaign, according to screenshots of private messages showing payments to the influencers, some with over a million followers.\nThe posts promoted air purifiers and face masks on LuxuryWildSpot.com, and masks on n95security.com and SmartMasks.uk — where they were described at the top of the site as a “Smart Antiviral N95 Pollution Mask” and elsewhere in smaller type as an “Anti Dust Cycling Face Mask.”\nOne of the accounts removed the post after The Times asked about it; others that were still online were removed for policy violations on Monday after The Times flagged them to the company. On Tuesday, Instagram announced it was banning ads and branded content promoting “certain medical supplies, including face masks.” None of the sites responded to requests for comment.\nRafael Cintron, a dropshipper and marketing consultant who teaches the business on YouTube, said he wasn’t surprised that people were trying to profit from the crisis. But he advised staying away from selling these products.\n“It’s not just supply and demand and connecting people,” he said. “It is really affecting the process of taking care of this pandemic and making sure that everybody goes back to their regular lives. That’s the real issue.”"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/international/2020/03/12/should-other-countries-copy-italys-nationwide-lockdown", "title": "Allitaliana - Should other countries copy Italy nationwide lockdown ? | International", "text": "GIOVAMBATTISTA PRESTI, a psychologist at the Kore University of Enna in Sicily, is an adviser to the Policlinico, Milan’s oldest hospital, which is at the centre of Italy’s covid-19 epidemic. Of great concern now, says Mr Presti, is staff burnout. He is particularly worried about post-traumatic stress disorder among some medics. If hospitals reach the point at which they no longer have the capacity to treat every patient, some of them “will be forced to decide who should go into intensive care and who should be left to die”.\nSimilar accounts are emerging elsewhere. Daniele Macchini is a doctor at the Humanitas Gavazzeni hospital in nearby Bergamo. It has been overwhelmed by covid-19 patients. “Cases are multiplying. We are getting 15-20 admissions a day,” he wrote on Facebook. “The results of the swabs come in one after another: positive, positive, positive. All of a sudden, accident and emergency is collapsing.” Nurses, he added, have been reduced to tears “because we cannot save everyone”.\nThese reports are coming out of Lombardy, a wealthy region whose health service is judged to be among the best in a country that last year came second in Europe in a health-care efficiency ranking by Bloomberg. On March 10th Antonio Pesenti, the intensive-care co-ordinator for Lombardy’s crisis unit, told journalists that the region’s health system was “one step from collapse”.\nItaly’s epidemic, which is still concentrated in Lombardy, spread rapidly. On February 25th the country’s health authorities had detected 322 cases of covid-19. Two weeks later that number had passed 10,000. Deaths have risen even more steeply as the virus, which is disproportionally lethal to the elderly, has attacked Europe’s oldest population. By March 11th, more than 800 of those infected had died.\nThe crisis in Italy is sending shivers down spines in Europe and America. In many countries the number of cases being detected is rising on a trajectory that will soon bring them to the point at which Italy currently finds itself (see chart). Governments elsewhere are watching to see whether Italy’s efforts slow its epidemic, spreading infections out over time and giving its hospitals some breathing room.\nOn March 8th the Italian government imposed nationwide curbs on large gatherings. Big weddings and funerals were banned; museums, cinemas and theatres were closed. Nationwide travel restrictions followed a day later. Italians are not allowed to leave—or travel within—the cities and towns where they live, except for work or emergencies. Restaurants, bars and all shops except foodstores and pharmacies were told to close entirely from March 12th. Europe has not seen controls on this scale since the second world war.\nOther European countries have, for the moment, opted for less restrictive measures. Like Italy, several countries including France, Spain and Greece have closed schools and universities. Some have banned big public gatherings. In America variations on these themes are being imposed at county or state level. A growing number of universities, including Harvard and Princeton, are switching to remote teaching or simply sending their students home. But if these limitations fail to slow rapidly and substantially the rate at which infections are increasing, Italy may become a role model.\nItaly’s national lockdown was prompted by its apparent success using comparable measures on a regional level. The government tested similar restrictions in two “red zones” around a handful of small towns in the northern part of the country where, in late February, it found its first big clusters of covid-19 cases. On March 8th Silvio Brusaferro, the president of Italy’s national public health institute, said the number of new infections in both areas was falling.\nBut that is no guarantee the national quarantine will lead to similar results. The efficacy of the shutdown depends on two things: the extent to which people comply with the rules; and the length of time the rules can be left in place, given their vast social and economic costs. For those watching Italy, the crucial question is whether they need to go to similar lengths, or whether a more modest set of restrictions will slow the epidemic.\nItaly is following the example set by China, which got a raging covid-19 epidemic in Hubei province under control and prevented outbreaks elsewhere by imposing stringent mass quarantines. Millions have been mostly stuck inside for weeks. In some cities, such as Wuhan, where the outbreak began, people have been prevented from leaving their homes for more than a month. The lockdown has been strictly enforced by neighbourhood committees and building managers, though restrictions are now being loosened as China’s new cases have dwindled. In Italy, by contrast, the implementation of the travel restrictions depends on the public’s co-operation. Authorities and doctors are imploring people to stay at home. But at checkpoints drivers need only show a self-certified form stating their reasons for travelling.\nSo far Italians seem to be adhering to the new rules. There have been exceptions. A hospital porter who tested positive for the virus and should have been in self-quarantine was found shopping in a supermarket at Sciacca in Sicily. He risks being charged with spreading an epidemic, which carries a maximum penalty of 12 years in jail. People were still gathering in bars and clubs—in at least one case, to watch a football match—before the strictest measures came into effect. But in Caserta near Naples, where a handful of infractions were reported on the first full day of police checks, a senior officer said: “Members of the public are starting to be aware that it’s in the interests of their health to keep their movements to a minimum.”\nThe extent to which people continue to comply with demands that they keep their distance from friends, colleagues and the general public depends in large part on how long they are required to do so. Social-distancing measures work best when they are put in place early, before an epidemic takes off, says Elias Mossialos from the London School of Economics. In China cities that imposed restrictions on mass gatherings and transport before identifying their first covid-19 case had fewer infections in the first week after that milestone than places that acted later.\nIn Britain, however, the government is worried about introducing such restrictions too soon. The country, which is at an earlier stage of its covid-19 outbreak than many others, has not yet banned mass gatherings, nor has it closed schools or instructed people to work from home. The scientists advising the government are concerned that if such measures come now, compliance fatigue may set in just as the epidemic is taking off. But tougher restrictions are almost certainly on the way. Sometime in the next two weeks everyone with symptoms of a cold will be asked to stay at home for seven days because at that point many such cases will be assumed to be covid-19 infections.\nThe experience of South Korea, which has seen one of the largest outbreaks of covid-19, suggests that scientists in Britain may be right to worry. Outside the city of Daegu, where most of the country’s covid-19 cases have been identified, the government has not introduced any mandatory restrictions—hoping instead that people will voluntarily follow advice to stay at home and to take precautions during gatherings that they cannot avoid. In Gyeonggi province, which surrounds Seoul, mourners at funerals have been told to co-operate with temperature checks before writing their names in visitors’ books. They have also been ordered to minimise contact and conversation with others in attendance (including relatives of the deceased). Across the country guests attending weddings must wear masks—as must the happy couples, prompting many to postpone their nuptials.\nRestaurants and bars in Seoul were noticeably quieter for a few days during the peak of the government’s official social-distancing campaign, which began in the capital on March 2nd. But that has changed in recent days. Seoul’s popular nightspots are once again seeing long queues forming. Trains are filling up and people are getting laxer about wearing masks. The shift is probably the result of officials saying that, based on a steep fall in new cases in recent days, they hope that the country has passed the peak of its epidemic.\nBut on March 11th a new cluster of infections was discovered in a call centre in an office building in Seoul that sits next to one of the city’s busiest subway interchanges. The outbreak may prompt people to stay at home once again. And the government may start enforcing its rules more strictly if the voluntary approach proves inadequate. On March 11th Park Won-soon, the mayor of Seoul, said that he may consider forcing call centres to shut down if they do not follow recommendations to keep their employees at a distance from each other.\nAs countries employ varying intensities of measures to battle their covid-19 epidemics, it should become clearer which work best—and whether the most drastic are the most effective. Gabriel Leung, an epidemiologist from Hong Kong University who was part of a World Health Organisation team that examined China’s efforts to contain its epidemic, says nobody knows yet what combination of controls works best against covid-19. “Do you need to do everything that the Chinese have done to control it?” he says, or is it enough to copy only certain elements. “That”, says Mr Leung, “is really the big question.” ■\nDig deeper:\n- For more coverage of covid-19 see our coronavirus hub\n- The science of the virus\n- Fatality rates for covid-19 could vary enormously\n- How to deal with a new sort of financial shock\nThis article appeared in the International section of the print edition under the headline \"All’italiana\""}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/coronavirus-outbreak-a-pandemic-in-all-but-name-says-expert", "title": "Coronavirus outbreak a pandemic  in all but name , says expert", "text": "Coronavirus outbreak a pandemic 'in all but name', says expert\nWhile WHO says virus still containable, sudden cases in Iran and Italy causing alarm\n- Coronavirus live blog: latest news and updates\nThe World Health Organization has played down fears of a coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world, despite sudden serious outbreaks in Italy and Iran, but some experts said they believed it was now inevitable.\n“Using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear,” said the WHO’s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, at a briefing.\nWe are not there yet, said Tedros. “What we see are epidemics in different parts of the world affecting different countries in different ways.”\nThe word pandemic is used to describe a serious disease that is spreading in an uncontrolled way around the world. China, he pointed out, appeared to have contained it. The international team sent in by the WHO, which is about to report its findings, has said the virus probably peaked between 23 January and 2 February.\nTedros added, however, that “the sudden increase in new cases is certainly very concerning”.\nMost worrying is the arrival of the coronavirus in Italy and Iran with no prior warning, presumably spread by people who were asymptomatic carriers. Italy now has 219 cases and seven people have died. The figures in Iran are disputed, but some reports claimed there had been 50 deaths in the city of Qom, which is a pilgrimage site.\nOther experts said it was hard to believe that Covid-19 would not now spread worldwide.\n“We now consider this to be a pandemic in all but name, and it’s only a matter of time before the World Health Organization starts to use the term in its communications,” said Dr Bharat Pankhania, from the University of Exeter Medical School.\n“This gives us focus and tells us that the virus is now appearing in other countries and transmitting far afield from China. However, it doesn’t change our approach in monitoring the outbreak. In the UK, there’s no need to move towards mitigation strategies, as so far, our containment policies are working. We only have 13 cases, and they are contained and controlled. I expect we will continue with this containment strategy while it’s successful.”\n“A pandemic means an infectious disease is spreading out of control in different regions of the world. We already have a Covid-19 epidemic in China and, more recently, large outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy. If those outbreaks cannot be brought under control, then Covid-19 would fit the criteria of a pandemic,” said Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh.\n“The immediate implication is that many different countries around the world may be sources of Covid-19 infections. This makes it much harder for any one country to detect and contain imported cases and trying to do so will place ever greater demands on national health systems.\nTedros said the new cases outside China reinforced the need for all countries to ensure they were ready for the arrival of Covid-19. “This is the time for all countries, communities and families and individuals to focus on preparing,” he said. “We do not live in a binary black and white world. It is not either/or. We must focus on containing while doing all we can to prepare for a potential pandemic.”\nThat would mean safeguarding the elderly and those with health problems and weakened immune systems, who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus.\nDr Michael Ryan, WHO’s director of emergencies, said a flu pandemic was more recognisable because of the knowledge scientists have of the way influenza viruses behave. “What we don’t understand yet in Covid-19 is the absolute transmission dynamics,” he said.\nThe Italian government has introduced stringent internal travel restrictions, closing off the worst-hit areas in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. About 50,000 people in 11 northern Italian towns have been under lockdown since Friday night, with police patrolling the streets and fines being imposed on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas.\nAustria suspended train services over the Alps to Italy for about four hours late on Sunday before restarting them after two travellers tested negative for coronavirus. A train carrying about 300 passengers from Venice, in Italy, to Munich, in Germany, was halted on the Italian side of the Brenner Pass before being allowed to continue its journey after the two tested negative, authorities said.\nFrance’s junior transport minister, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, said on Monday that there was no need to close down transport borders between France and Italy.\n“Closing down the borders would make no sense, as the circulation of the virus is not just limited to administrative borders,” he told BFM Business."}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/world-politicians-coronavirus-e8299289-a760-48c1-8d26-d6438d75380e.html", "title": "Politicians hold the fate of the coronavirus in their hands", "text": "Politicians hold the fate of the coronavirus in their hands\nIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\nThe fate of countries around the world lies in a very few individual politicians' hands — more so than at any other time in half a century or more.\nWhy it matters: Two politicians in particular, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin, wiped about $20 trillion off the value of the world's oil reserves this week when they failed to come to an agreement on cutting oil production. That's more than $2,500 per human being on the planet.\nThe spread of the novel coronavirus is similarly a function of decisive action by heads of state, or the lack thereof. Governments alone determine whether the number of new cases increases exponentially, or whether it is brought under control within days.\nOf note: The Chinese government, through inaction, allowed COVID-19 to grow to the degree that global infections were inevitable. Subsequent Chinese actions, however, were decisive and effective.\n- South Korea has also been effective in combating the coronavirus and has managed to do so through \"openness and transparency\" rather than lockdowns.\n- Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has locked down the entire country, imposing severe restrictions on travel and shuttering all stores except groceries and pharmacies.\n- President Trump, by contrast, sent markets into a series of tailspins by talking about the virus as a political attack rather than as an epidemiological emergency. His plan for minimizing the domestic spread of COVID-19 is notable mainly for its nonexistence.\nThe big picture: It's generally very difficult to determine the amount of credit or blame for economic conditions that can be laid at the feet of any individual politician. Heads of state tend to inherit an economic system and stick with that system. But a global pandemic is exactly the kind of shock that only government action can address.\n- Russia and Saudi Arabia have already failed the test. Faced with a significant decline in demand from the coronavirus, they failed to agree to cut supply by a similar amount. Instead, they both decided to increase production, sending oil (and stock market) prices plunging.\n- The United States is also failing. Its official count of 1,281 coronavirus cases is much lower than the reality, given that testing kits have been extremely scarce and that the country had tested fewer than 5,000 people as of Monday. (South Korea, by contrast, with only 15% of the U.S. population, has tested almost 200,000 people.)\nThe bottom line: In normal day-to-day life, someone with the novel coronavirus will infect more than 3 other individuals. That's a simple recipe for exponential growth. Effective heads of state have shown that they have the ability to change individual behavior across their country so that the number gets reduced to less than 1.\n- Normally, the health of a country is a function of the strength of its economy. That correlation has now temporarily been upended. Politicians need to slow down economic activity to save their countries.\nGo deeper: Brace for coronavirus supply shocks"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/queens-stadium-to-be-converted-into-temporary-hospital-in-coronavirus-fight-11585605068", "title": "Queens Stadium to Be Converted Into Temporary Hospital in Coronavirus Fight", "text": "- U.S.\n- New York\n- Tri-State Area\nQueens Stadium to Be Converted Into Temporary Hospital in Coronavirus Fight\nTraining facility at Billie Jean King Tennis Center will have 350 beds as Covid-19 cases surge in New York\nNew York City’s emergency management office plans to build a 350-bed facility at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park as efforts intensify to supplement hospital space as the U.S. battles the coronavirus pandemic.\nConstruction could begin as early as Tuesday at an indoor training center at the facility, which has multiple courts and wide spaces, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Tennis Association.

Like Cecil for instance: “They’re all foreigners, don’t understand our ways.”\nSpot on, though not in the way he meant. The care staff who make our breakfasts and wipe our bottoms don’t understand our ways, because many of them come from cultures that view the dislocation of elderly people from their families, the outsourcing of their care to paid strangers as barbaric. “Who’s going to replace them, that’s what scares me.” Elizabeth is known for her honesty. With half the “economically inactive” already undertaking care and many of the others retired themselves and on the cusp of being cared for, there’s not exactly a queue for care jobs.\n“I’m more scared of this virus thing, corona whatsit, and if there’s fewer carers, well…” Joyce this time. Cecil scoffs, pointing out that there’s a flu epidemic every winter. Charlie adds that it’s nature’s way of culling, which chimes with the comments I’ve received from neighbours in the almshouses, not quite “que sera, sera”, but a sanguine recognition that all of us crumblies are headed for the exit, one way or another. The reason why older people are more concerned about the deficit in care than about catching the virus is simple; we are less afraid of being dead than we are of the process of dying. The care worker is the only human buffer between us and the indignity of the final process. Hardly attractive work, I suggest. “So?” Charlie ripostes “It’s a job, get on with it. We’re all human after all.”\nBut are we? Human, I mean. We uber-old are a novelty, a new breed, almost a new species. Only two generations back, the octogenarian was the exception. The majority of us departed on time. Longevity has generated dysfunctions and ineptitudes that require of those who care for us a portfolio of skills for which there is no accredited prior learning.\nThat, for me, is the real issue of the government’s immigration policies, not the xenophobic undertone. To describe care work as “low-skilled” reveals a serious misconception: there is no issue about which the inhabitants of the palace of Westminster are more illiterate than social care, perhaps because frontbenches have ever been occupied by men, primarily, with a history of nanny, matron, bedders and scouts. To understand the skills required for the delivery of care, you need to understand how it feels to be old and on the receiving end. We are afraid of tomorrow’s indignities. We feel guilty for today’s privileges. We resent the erosion of yesterday’s independence. Above all we feel humiliated by our redundancy. It is a degrading process that makes us querulous, perverse, implacable and that’s why delivering the most intimate services to us demands an emotional literacy which is off the scale.\nPoliticians do not appreciate any of this, nor that care goes beyond bodily hygiene: it is essential to wellbeing and involves mental and physical health, especially during the present coronavirus crisis, when carers can serve as frontline diagnosticians of infection.\nNot content with devaluing their skills and paying them below the subsistence rate, the commercial care industry drives a work regime that gives no time to establish and maintain the crucial emotional connection that tells us that we matter, and can tell how we are feeling.\nThe alarm and confusion provoked by Westminster’s indifference to care has been reinforced by the tabloid scaremongering from Whitehall, with its contradictory messages about an illness with common cold symptoms requiring morgues in public parks. Together they create fear and it is fear that is masked by Charlie and Cecil as they grumble and gripe.\nLike them, I am graduating from slippered pantaloon into zimmered malcontent. Caring for me will require a much higher level of patience and humanity than that required to stack shelves in supermarkets. By equating them, the political establishment reveals an alarming illiteracy about civic values.\nFaced with the prospect of a decade of undignified deterioration in a “care-less” society run by emotional illiterates, if I am honest, I do not find the possibility of an early Covid-19-induced departure quite so daunting.\n• Stewart Dakers is an 81-year-old community worker"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/f91d0b6e51b22c377d6730ea7f1b16ea", "title": "Woman who went to hospital twice tests positive for virus", "text": "Woman who went to hospital twice tests positive for virus\nATLANTA (AP) — A woman who went to a Georgia emergency center with flu-like symptoms late last month has tested positive for COVID-19 by the state health lab, officials said Friday.\nThe Georgia Department of Public Health said it is still awaiting final confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the Floyd County case.\nThe 46-year-old woman went to the emergency care center on Feb. 29, but didn’t meet testing criteria for COVID-19 and was released, Floyd Medical Center said in a statement.

Though she still didn’t meet the criteria for coronavirus testing, her doctor and the district health director for the region pushed for it, the hospital said.\nAt the “adamant urging” of the two local health officials, the CDC and the state health agency authorized the testing. The initial testing that returned a positive result was completed Thursday, state health officials said.\nState officials have requested expedited processing for an official determination from the CDC, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said in a statement Friday.\nOfficials haven’t disclosed where the woman went or who she might have been in contact with in the three days between her two visits to the emergency room. However, state health officials are now working to identify any people who might have been exposed, the agency said in statement.\nFloyd County is about 70 miles (115 kilometers) northwest of Atlanta.\nIf confirmed, it would be the third case of COVID-19 in Georgia. The state’s first case was a 56-year-old Fulton County man who had traveled to Atlanta from Milan, Italy on Feb. 22. He began showing symptoms of the disease a few days later, health officials said earlier this week. The man’s teenage son also tested positive for the disease.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

On February 10th a rocket blasted off from Florida carrying Solar Orbiter, a European space probe designed to solve some of them. This craft will spend the next two years performing fly-bys of Venus and Earth, using the gravity of both planets to kick itself into an unusual orbit that will take it well above the ecliptic, the plane in which all of the sun’s planets orbit.\nFrom that vantage Solar Orbiter will peer at the sun’s poles, something no spacecraft has managed before, and do so from close up. At its nearest, it will be just 42m km from the sun—closer than Mercury, the innermost planet, gets. One of its features is, therefore, a heat shield coated with charcoal made from cooked animal bone and designed to endure temperatures up to 500°C. Tiny windows within this will illuminate the probe’s various instruments.\nThose instruments are designed to shed light, as it were, on several questions. One concerns the solar wind, a flow of charged particles that streams from the sun at a rate of more than 1m tonnes a second. The solar wind blows at an average speed of 400km a second, but physicists do not know exactly what accelerates those particles to such a velocity. Another mystery is the sun’s magnetic field. Every 11 years or so, for reasons only partly understood, this flips its north and south poles around. Solar Orbiter’s masters hope their charge will observe such a reversal, which is expected to happen within the next few years.\nThey also hope that Solar Orbiter will advance the nascent science of solar-weather forecasting. The entire solar system is bathed in the solar wind, which means that what happens on the sun can affect conditions around the planets. Solar flares—sudden spikes in the sun’s brightness—boost radiation levels in the neighbourhood of Earth, which can interfere with satellites’ electronics, alter their orbits and pose health risks to astronauts. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are occasional burps of superheated plasma that the sun releases into space, can disrupt radio communications and induce large, potentially damaging electric currents in power grids, communication lines and the like.\nThese risks are not hypothetical. In 1859 a massive CME caused auroras as far south as the Caribbean and damaged telegraph systems all over America and Europe. Another, in 1989, caused nine-hour blackouts across large parts of north-eastern Canada. Britain’s government lists a direct hit from a big CME on its National Risk Register of potential disasters, alongside floods, pandemic diseases and big terrorist attacks. Early warning of such space-going storms would help resist their effects.\nSolar Orbiter is not the only craft soon to endure a close encounter with the sun. In 2018 NASA, America’s space agency, launched the Parker Solar Probe. This will orbit even closer, at a distance of just 6.2m km. Researchers see the missions as complementary. Parker will fly through the corona, a tenuous atmosphere that stretches far out from the sun’s luminous sphere, allowing it to sample the gas there directly. But that is much too close for any kind of direct optical observation, says Richard Harrison, chief scientist at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Britain, and one of Solar Orbiter’s designers. Parker, in other words, suffers from the same limitation as Earthbound human astronomers: it cannot look directly at the blinding light emitted by the object it is studying. ■\nThis article appeared in the Science & technology section of the print edition under the headline \"Hot topics\""}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/b2544b5e8bebd318cadfb681dbda15cb", "title": "New virus causing Chinese tourists to cancel trips to Alaska", "text": "New virus causing Chinese tourists to cancel trips to Alaska\nA spreading virus is keeping Chinese travelers at home, leading to hundreds of cancellations during the peak of Alaska’s winter tourism season.\nAbout 500 travelers canceled February itineraries with a travel agency that caters solely to Chinese tourists, The Anchorage Daily News reported Tuesday.\nHotels, dog mushing businesses and aurora borealis tour operators also reported losing business because of the illness known as COVID-19 that emerged last year in central China.\nAlaska had no recorded cases of the virus as of mid-February.\nChinese tourists make up a fast-growing group of travelers to Alaska.

If the virus continues to spread, it will act as a sort of tax on group formation and physical-space community. Every component of the tourism economy will falter, including airlines, hotels, restaurants, museums, and amusement parks. As more Americans self-quarantine, ride-share and taxi drivers will lose income and gas stations will struggle. With their income pinched, workers in each of those fields will spend less in the economy.\nRead: The problem with telling sick workers to stay home\nBasic macroeconomic theory says there are two ways to address a crisis like this.\nThe first is monetary policy, which would typically mean central banks cutting short-term interest rates to stimulate economic activity. But interest rates are already at historic lows, which reflects a need for other forms of stimulus.\nThe second is fiscal policy. That means the U.S. government giving people and firms money—either without strings attached or for earmarked purposes, such as building infrastructure. With long-term interest rates under 1 percent, borrowers are essentially paying the U.S. to hold on to their money. The federal government could use this opportunity to do a number of things, such as finance green infrastructure. But first, it should pass a massive fiscal stimulus to confront the economic effects of the viral outbreak.\nRead: What you can do right now about the coronavirus\nWhat might an Antiviral Stimulus look like? Here are four ideas:\n- Cold, hard cash.Giving Americans money should make them more willing to withdraw from work, more comfortable about an extended break from public life, and more stable if their line of work is threatened by the epidemic. In 2008, George W. Bush signed an economic stimulus that mailed checks to families within six weeks of the bill’s passage. The White House could do a beefed-up version of that stimulus by writing every adult a check for $1,500 with an extra $1,000 per child.\nInstead, the Trump administration has proposed a payroll-tax cut. Although that’s a fast way to get workers money, the largest benefits of such a plan would flow to upper-middle-class workers, who can often do their jobs remotely. The front line of the epidemic is the leisure and hospitality sector, where low-wage workers constantly interact with people face-to-face. What these workers really need is universal paid sick leave.\n- Paid sick leave.Before the coronavirus outbreak, the lack of paid sick leave in this country was merely morally indefensible. During a viral outbreak, it’s also just plain dumb. As Amanda Mull has written forThe Atlantic, millions of American workers cannot take time off in the event of an illness, which means they are encouraged to remain at work, where they become unwitting vectors of mass contamination. Fortunately, a solution may be imminent. White House advisers have reportedly briefed the president on such a policy, and House Democrats plan to introduce guaranteed sick leave for certain workers in a forthcoming bill. Even if this bill passes, however, Washington will still have to deal with likely increases in unemployment.\n- Expanded unemployment insurance.Unless we get very lucky, the epidemic will cost many thousands of people their jobs at the same time that their families are either going through a medical emergency or feeling terrified that illness is imminent. The federal government jointly funds jobless benefits with the states, but in this crisis, Washington should fully fund a large increase in the dollar amounts of unemployment insurance. This would help stabilize the finances of individuals and families who lose their jobs on account of a viral recession.\n- Emergency funds for state and local governments.A large part of the 2009 stimulus was earmarked for states and cities to make up for the tax revenue they would lose after employees lost their jobs. A sharp recession in 2020 will require the same intervention. In this crisis, emergency funds could also help states pay for expanded health-care treatment, because 10 percent of state spending goes to hospitals."}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/23/russian-prisoner-in-us-yaroshenko-tested-after-cellmates-coronavirus-death-a70080", "title": "Russian Prisoner in U .

So strong is China’s diplomatic pressure that Taiwan can no longer take part in the organization’s annual World Health Assembly, even as an observer.\nChina claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan and uses its diplomatic clout to stop the island from joining any organizations that require statehood for membership. Taiwan left the United Nations in 1971 when China joined and is excluded from all of its agencies, including the International Civil Aviation Organization, which has also played a role in the current crisis.\nBut some observers say Taiwan’s publicity offensive seems at least as much about highlighting its China-imposed diplomatic isolation as it is about public health.\nLack of WHO membership puts Taiwan at risk of missing firsthand updates on infectious diseases, but the island’s government has found alternative ways to stay informed, officials and analysts say.\n“I think the WHO matter is more politics than real needs,” said Alex Chiang, associate professor of international politics at National Chengchi University in Taipei. “Even though we are not in WHO, we can still get this info from many, many other places.”\nStill, delays in getting the latest information pose a danger to Taiwan and the international community, foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanna Ou said.\n“If there is no way to get timely information about the outbreak as well as no way to participate completely in international health bodies, that could pose a high-level risk,” she said.\nChina’s isolation campaign against Taiwan has grown since 2016, when independence-leaning Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen took office.\nChina’s Communist government seeks to lump Taiwan with the semi-autonomous Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macao when reporting outbreak data, something considered highly condescending to the people of the island who have never been ruled by the Communist government in Beijing.\nThe new viral disease, COVID-19, has caused 1,380 deaths in mainland China as of Friday. Taiwan has reported 18 cases, all linked to people who flew in from China, but no fatalities.\nDespite the obstacles, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic in Geneva said Wednesday that the organization is allowing Taiwan to access information about the virus and is also taking virus data from Taiwan for wider use. Taiwan was also invited to participate in a global coronavirus forum this week, Jasarevic said.\n“We have Taiwanese experts involved in all of our consultations — the clinical networks, laboratory networks, and others — so they’re fully engaged and fully aware of all of the developments in the expert networks,” Jasarevic said.\nDisease outbreaks always lay bare the effects of Taiwan’s exclusion from organizations such as WHO, analysts say. Pragmatism generally wins out in the end, even if Beijing’s approval is required first.\nAs Taiwan grappled in 2003 with SARS, a related viral disease that also originated in China, WHO sent a two-person team to Taipei that helped local health authorities control the outbreak, which contributed to 73 deaths on the island.\n“If there’s a true outbreak like the SARS outbreak, WHO wouldn’t withhold assistance because, what if it spread to somewhere else?” said Joanna Lei, chief executive officer of the Chunghua 21st Century Think Tank in Taiwan."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-trends.html", "title": "Opinion | Our New Historical Divide : B . C . and A . C . the World Before Corona and the World After", "text": "Before the coronavirus crisis hit, I was toying with writing a book about 21st-century political parties, but in light of this global epidemic it’s obvious that whatever nonfiction book you’re working on now, put it down. There is the world B.C. — Before Corona — and the world A.C. — After Corona. We have not even begun to fully grasp what the A.C. world will look like, but here are some trends I’m watching.\nUnknown unknowns. I wrote my book “The World Is Flat” about growing global interconnectedness in 2004. The world has gotten so much flatter and interconnected since. Heck, when I started writing that book, Facebook was just being launched; Twitter was only a sound; the cloud was still in the sky; 4G was a parking place; LinkedIn was a prison; for most people, applications were what you sent to colleges, Skype was a typo and Big Data was a rap star. And the iPhone was still Steve Jobs’s secret pet project.\nAll of those connectivity tools, not to mention global trade and tourism, exploded after 2004 and really wired the world. Which is why our planet today is not just interconnected, it’s interdependent — and in many ways even fused.\nThis has driven a lot of economic growth. But it’s also meant that when things go bad in one place, that trouble can be transmitted farther, faster, deeper and cheaper than ever. So, a virus-laden bat bites another mammal in China, that mammal is sold in a Wuhan wildlife market, it infects a Chinese diner with a new coronavirus and in a few weeks all my public schools are closed and I’m edging six feet away from everyone in Bethesda.\nBut that’s why this virus crisis is so not over. Bill Joy, the computer scientist who co-founded Sun Microsystems, put it to me like this: “The last few weeks were actually pretty unsurprising and predictable in how the pandemic spread. But we’ve now reached a point where all of our interlocking systems, each with their own feedback loops, are all shutting down in unpredictable ways. This will inevitably lead to some random and chaotic consequences — like health care workers not having child care.”\nThe power of exponentials: One of the hardest things for the human mind to grasp is the power of an exponential — something that just keeps relentlessly doubling and doubling, like a pandemic. The brain just can’t appreciate how quickly 5,000 cases of confirmed coronavirus infection in America can explode into one million if we don’t lock down now.\nHere’s a simple way to explain the exponential threat we face — in a way an oft-bankrupt real estate developer like Donald Trump might understand. It was also offered by Bill Joy: “The virus is like a loan shark who charges 25 percent a day interest. We borrowed $1 (the first coronavirus to appear here). We then fiddled for 40 days. Now we owe $7,500. If we wait three more weeks to pay, we’ll owe almost $1 million.”\nThat’s why working every single day to slow the rate of infection and testing everyone possible is everything. Lose that battle, lose the war.\nThat’s also why the only number I am watching now is not the Federal Reserve’s interest rates, it’s the number of critical-care coronavirus patients versus the number of general hospital and I.C.U. beds in the country needed to care for them. If the second number can accommodate the first number when the virus peaks, we’ll be O.K. If it can’t, we’re going to have pandemonium on top of a pandemic.\nThe upside of exponentials. There is, though, another exponential that may end up saving us: Moore’s Law, which was coined by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 and posited that the speed and processing power of computers would double every two years, as more transistors could be steadily packed on a microchip.\nIntel, to explain the power of Moore’s Law to make all kinds of things better, smarter, faster, had its engineers take a 1971 Volkswagen Beetle and try to calculate what that car would be like today if it had improved at the same exponential rate that microchips had improved since 1971. Intel’s engineers’ best guess was that that Volkswagen Beetle today would go about 300,000 miles per hour, it would get two million miles per gallon and it would cost 4 cents.\nThat is the power of an exponential in engineering on the upside — and it may be just the kind of exponential that can also help bring us a coronavirus treatment and vaccine quickly.\nAs Nitin Pai, director of the Takshashila Institution, an independent research center in Bangalore, India, wrote on livemint.com on Sunday: “Advances in computer technology and synthetic biology have revolutionized both detection and diagnosis of pathogens, as well as the processes of design and development of vaccines, subjecting them to Moore’s Law-type cycles. Recent epidemics, starting with SARS, and including H1N1, Ebola, Zika and now Covid-19, will drive more talent and brainpower to the biological and epidemiological sciences.”\nBut will it be fast enough? Even in the age of supercomputers, noted Gautam Mukunda, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership, “we still have no vaccine for H.I.V. or malaria — two widespread critical diseases that we have been fighting for years. It is definitely true that the science will reach the point where we can develop new vaccines on the fly; the problem is, it’s still really, really hard.”\nWill American culture or politics be fundamentally changed by this pandemic? I know for sure one joke Republican politicians will not be telling on the campaign trail this year. It’s the one where they impugn the deep state, government bureaucrats and get the audience to laugh by saying, “Hi, I’m from the government and I’m here to help.”\nWe’ll get through this crisis because of the depth of talent, and selfless commitment, in our deep state, our Big Government: the scientists, the medical professionals, the disaster professionals, the environmental experts — all the people whom Trump tried to prune. Right now I am rooting for both Big Government and Big Pharma to rescue us.\nOur political culture may also change before this is over. My friend Prof. Michele Gelfand from the University of Maryland is the author of “Rule Makers, Rule Breakers: How Tight and Loose Cultures Wire the World.”\nIn an essay in The Boston Globe last week, Gelfand recalled that in a paper she and her colleagues published in Science several years ago, they classified countries in terms of how much they prioritized rules over freedom as either “tight” or “loose,” writing: “Tight societies, like China, Singapore and Austria have many rules and punishments governing social behavior. Citizens in those places are used to a high degree of monitoring aimed at reinforcing good behavior. Loose cultures, in countries such as the United States, Italy and Brazil, have weaker rules and are much more permissive.”\nThese differences in tightness and looseness, she argued, were not random: “Countries with the strongest laws and strictest punishments are those with histories of famine, warfare, natural disasters, and, yes, pathogen outbreaks. These disaster-prone nations have learned the hard way over centuries: Tight rules and order save lives. Meanwhile, cultures that have faced few threats — such as the United States — have the luxury of remaining loose.”\nIt’s been pretty obvious, said Gelfand, that “famously ‘tight’ societies like Singapore and Hong Kong … have demonstrated the most effective response to Covid-19.”\nAt the same time, our deficiencies in White House coordination and reckless public figures — like Larry Kudlow, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Rush Limbaugh, Kellyanne Conway, Devin Nunes and Trump himself —– who initially minimized the virus’s potential impact or imputed political motives to those pounding the table for action, helped compound the risks to us all.\nSo, Gelfand concluded: “In all of the uncertainty, we need to remember that the trajectory of the virus has as much to do with the nature of the coronavirus as it does with culture. Our loose cultural programming needs to do a big switch in the days to come.”\nThe Greatest Generation did it in World War II. But can we now?\nOnly generosity will save us. There are millions of business owners and employers out there who are invested in long-term assets that they were assuming would go up in value — a stock, a company, a home, a restaurant, a store — with borrowed money. That’s money that they can’t now repay.\nTherefore, we not only need the Fed to backstop their banks to prevent a total meltdown, we not only need the banks to restructure their debts, we need to get fresh cash into the pockets of all their workers so they can eat after their last paycheck is spent. It is encouraging to see the administration and Congress moving rapidly to do just that.\nThe more we simultaneously tighten our culture and loosen our purses, the stronger and kinder society we’ll be A.C. — After Corona.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-tests-everyone-tiny-colorado-county/608590/", "title": "Coronavirus Tests for Everyone in a Tiny Colorado County", "text": "San Miguel County in Colorado has, in ordinary times, fewer than three full-time employees in its public-health department. It has no hospital. Its total population is only 8,000. And yet last week, the county became the first in the United States to announce that it would be offering all its residents a new kind of test for COVID-19.\nThe tests are being donated by United Biomedical, a multinational biotech company whose executives, a married couple, happen to live part of the year in Telluride, the resort town that is also San Miguel’s county seat.\n“It’s a small community,” Mei Mei Hu of United Biomedical told me on the phone from Colorado this weekend. “Very small,” her husband, Lou Reese, added. “Whether it’s just getting a donut or walking by on the street or on the ski hill with the ski patrol,” he said, “we know and have met or interacted with almost every member of the medical or emergency community here throughout the course of our lives.”\nHu and Reese—along with Hu’s mother, Chang Yi Wang, who is United Biomedical’s chairwoman—are the founders of the company’s new COVID-19–focused subsidiary, c19. United Biomedical has facilities in New York, China, and Taiwan, and it develops animal vaccines as well as diagnostic kits for human diseases. So when the novel coronavirus first appeared in China, the company started working on testing, and when cases started showing up closer to home, Hu and Reese thought of their community in Telluride. They floated the idea of testing the county to an old family friend, who also happens to be the area’s chief paramedic.

The only way to do that is by testing.”\nOriginally, doctors in the U.S. were advised not to test people unless they had been to China or had contact with someone who had been diagnosed with the disease. Within the past two weeks, the CDC said it would start screening people in five U.S. cities, in an effort to give some idea of how many cases are actually out there. But tests are still not widely available. As of Friday, the Association of Public Health Laboratories said that only California, Nebraska, and Illinois had the capacity to test people for the virus.\nWith so little data, prognosis is difficult. But the concern that this virus is beyond containment—that it will be with us indefinitely—is nowhere more apparent than in the global race to find a vaccine, one of the clearest strategies for saving lives in the years to come.\nOver the past month, stock prices of a small pharmaceutical company named Inovio have more than doubled. In mid-January, it reportedly discovered a vaccine for the new coronavirus. This claim has been repeated in many news reports, even though it is technically inaccurate. Like other drugs, vaccines require a long testing process to see whether they indeed protect people from disease, and do so safely. What this company—and others—has done is copy a bit of the virus’s RNA that one day could prove to work as a vaccine. It’s a promising first step, but to call it a discovery is like announcing a new surgery after sharpening a scalpel.\nThough genetic sequencing is now extremely fast, making vaccines is as much art as science. It involves finding a viral sequence that will reliably cause a protective immune-system memory but not trigger an acute inflammatory response that would itself cause symptoms. (While the influenza vaccine cannot cause the flu, the CDC warns that it can cause “flu-like symptoms.”) Hitting this sweet spot requires testing, first in lab models and animals, and eventually in people. One does not simply ship a billion viral gene fragments around the world to be injected into everyone at the moment of discovery.\nInovio is far from the only small biotech company venturing to create a sequence that strikes that balance. Others include Moderna, CureVac, and Novavax. Academic researchers are also on the case, at Imperial College London and other universities, as are federal scientists in several countries, including at the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Anthony Fauci, the head of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, wrote inJAMAin January that the agency was working at historic speed to find a vaccine. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, researchers moved from obtaining the genomic sequence of the virus and into a phase 1 clinical trial of a vaccine in 20 months. Fauci wrote that his team has since compressed that timeline to just over three months for other viruses, and for the new coronavirus, “they hope to move even faster.”"}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-crisis-what-travelers-now-need-to-know/a-52734140", "title": "Coronavirus crisis : What travelers now need to know | DW Travel | DW", "text": "Most governments strongly advise their citizens to avoid travel and postpone their plans indefinitely. Tour operators are canceling their offers, and airlines are cancelling flights along with international connections. TUI, the world's largest tourism group, is suspending almost all its regular operations.\nThe most important question is no longer where can holidaymakers travel to, but rather how to get back home. That's why the German Foreign Ministry has launched a repatriation program for thousands of Germans who are stuck abroad due to travel restrictions imposed as a result of the coronavirus crisis.\nForeign Minister Heiko Maas announced on Tuesday (March 17, 2020) that up to 50 million euros (54.9 million USD) would be made available for this purpose. He said that the main target groups were holidaymakers in Morocco, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, Egypt and the Maldives.\nThe politician, a member of the SPD party, spoke of an \"airlift\". In the past few days, many countries have closed borders and cut flight connections due to the rapid spread of coronavirus infections. Since Germany has become one of the risk countries, German travelers are particularly strongly affected by the restrictions.\nWhat do travelers from Germany have to take into account?\nThe first port of call for questions from tourists from Germany is the Foreign Ministry website. It provides up-to-date travel and safety information about the risks in the various destinations.\nUntil now, the German government had merely advised against travelling to a few countries that were particularly affected by the coronavirus. Now the German government has even issued a global travel warning. Such a step is only taken if there is a danger to life and limb.\nIn the coronavirus crisis, such a warning had previously only been issued for the Chinese region where the virus originated. \"We must prevent more Germans from becoming stranded abroad,\" Maas explained the unusual step, adding: \"Please just stay home.\"\nThe website of the Federal Foreign Ministry continues to state that further drastic restrictions on air and tourist traffic, quarantine measures and the restriction of public life in many countries are to be expected.\nChanges to the entry and quarantine regulations would in some cases be made without any prior notice and with immediate effect. Many travellers in several countries are currently affected and prevented from travelling on or returning home.\nZurich Airport is also unusually quiet at the moment due to the corona virus\nAre travelers from Europe entitled to claim reimbursement and compensation?\nIn the event of flight cancellations or if a tour operator cancels a package tour on their own initiative, customers will be reimbursed the full price. However, there is no general right to additional compensation if the providers can point to exceptional circumstances due to the virus.\nIf the flight or trip has not already been cancelled by the provider, travelers can also choose to cancel themselves. If they can cite exceptional circumstances, they do not pay anything. This does not necessarily mean that a travel warning or entry restriction has to be issued: Even if a package tour is significantly impeded or impaired, those affected can cancel free of charge, for example because major sights or routes are blocked locally, which could not be foreseen before the booking was made.\nTourism has slumped worldwide\nIndividual travelers find it more difficult to get their various bookings, for example of accommodation and transport, refunded. If services have been booked directly in the country of travel, the only way to obtain reimbursement is to contact the respective contract partner. \"If you do not want to travel, even though free cancellation is not possible, you should seek an amicable goodwill solution,\" is the advice issued by ADAC, the German automobile association.\nGerman rail operator Deutsche Bahn is expanding the possibilities for customers to postpone or cancel their journey. \"The goodwill arrangements will apply in the coming weeks, so it is not necessary to contact us immediately,\" the company emphasized. Refunds can also be submitted after the booked day of travel.\nFor all tickets purchased by March 13 with travel dates between March 13 and April 30, passengers can postpone their journey and use the ticket as a flexible fare for the booked route until June 30. For the discounted \"Sparpreise\" economy price and \"Supersparpreise\" tickets, the train connection is voided.\nWhat do travelers who come from another continent have to be aware of?\nAgain, it is best to contact your own foreign ministry or embassy to find out whether there are any general restrictions or limitations, for example regarding the accessibility of places of interest.\nThe Australian government, for example, advises its citizens to reconsider any overseas travel, especially because of the risk of infection and unpredictable restrictions caused by the coronavirus in the targeted area. Those who have already traveled have been asked to organize their journey home as soon as possible.\nThe US government is calling on American citizens to reconsider all planned trips abroad. Even countries that have not yet registered any confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections may impose travel restrictions without prior warning. In its travel advice, the State Department raised the overall level of travel warnings to three out of four. Level three states that trips should be reconsidered. The highest level four warns against traveling to these areas.\nWhat does the World Health Organization (WHO) advise?\nFace masks do not protect against infection unless you are infected yourself, says the WHO\nPeople with pre-existing conditions should postpone or avoid planned travel to regions with an increased risk of infection, especially older people suffering from chronic illness. In addition, the WHO recommends following the generally accepted hygiene guidelines: wash your hands frequently, cough into the crook of your arm or handkerchief, and avoid touching your face.\nWhat do travelers have to consider when returning home?\nEntry requirements vary greatly from country to country. Returning travelers should also ask their embassy about the current situation.\nAccording to Maas, the Foreign Ministry agreed on Monday (March 16, 2020) with commercial flight providers such as Lufthansa to launch a \"one-off program\" to bring back German tourists. All travelers wishing to use the \"airlift \" have been called on to check the website of the Federal Foreign Ministry and contact their tour operators.\nFurther details will be announced as soon as possible, Maas said. The German embassies and consulates were \"already doing their utmost to provide individual and fast assistance\" and remained available for inquiries.\nAsked about the situation for German tourists in Morocco, Maas said that this involved a particularly large number of travelers, with \"four to five thousand\" people stuck there.\nBecause of the high volume of traffic, he said, action would have to be taken very quickly there, which poses \"extreme challenges\" for everyone. In some cases, however, repatriations have already begun, and Maas added that: \"we will continue to push this in the coming days.\"\nIn many countries, people who return from risk areas by plane or ship are required to provide their details. In Germany, so-called exit cards must be filled out on arrival. On these cards, passengers must provide information on their state of health, where they will be for the next 30 days, as well as information on stops in their countries of origin and contact persons. This makes them easier to find later in the event of an emergency should a fellow passenger test positive.\n-\nCoronavirus: The consequences for tourism\nBavaria's beer gardens reopen\nOn May 18th, the coronavirus lockdown for Bavaria's outdoor gastronomy is to end and the beer gardens will reopen.

But a lot is happening online. Just take a look at the Instagram accounts of star opera singers.\n\"Corona, corona, corona, we're all now sitting at home / Corona, corona, corona, instead of visiting the theater,\" warbles the celebrated tenor Jonas Kaufmann to a cheerful accordion melody playing on his computer. \"Concert hall and opera, everything is shut, so all we have is hope it won't take all that long.\"\n\"It's good that you haven't lost your sense of humor,\" comments one Instagram friend on Kaufmann's corona serenade, which has gained 6,000-odd likes on the social media platform.\nWith performances, recordings and even rehearsals canceled for the foreseeable future, Kaufmann and his fellow opera superstars from across the globe are trying to keep a positive attitude during their corona downtime. Some are now simply going on tour through their apartments.\nUndaunted in times of crisis\nEven in the midst of a global pandemic, Russian-Austrian diva Anna Netrebko exudes life-affirming energy online. Having performed alongside Jonas Kaufmann in Verdi's La Forza del Destino in March 2019, Netrebko is in corona isolation in her spacious apartment in downtown Vienna a year later.\nShe might regret that she cannot shine as Tosca on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera in March and April as had been planned but is making the most of her life indoors with son, Tjago, and tenor husband Yusif Eyvazov.\nPancakes, hats, nostalgia for a different world: Anna Netrebko's Instagram in times of Corona\nNetrebko's Instagram community, which has now grown to over half a million subscribers, is watching \"Annuschka\" with great interest as she remodels her living room: Dressed in pajama bottoms, the singer enthusiastically moves heavy furniture on her own. She also carefully sorts her impressive hat collection. And then the cooking begins.\nFood is, after all, one of the singer's great offstage passions. Whether tacos with pulled beef; tagliatelle with prawns in cream sauce; pancakes with sour cream; or raspberries pureed with brown sugar, cooking à la Netrebko is as rich as her vocals.\nNetrebko believes it's important to impart her culinary know-how to her followers because, as she reminds them: \"Corona doesn't mean you stop eating.\"\nVacation at home: Kristine Opolais says hi from Latvia, Piotr Beczala from Poland\nHome sweet home\nFor many international stars, the corona timeout also means an unexpected opportunity to return home in the middle of an opera season. Latvian soprano Kristine Opolais, ex-wife of conductor Andris Nelsons, is enjoying spring at Jurmala, a sophisticated spa southeast of the capital, Riga.\nIn a short video message she calls on everyone to enjoy the quiet time and to reflect on the \"real values\" in their lives, and the \"people who you really love, and understand who really loves you.\"\nThe tenor Piotr Beczala, who raised a storm of applause as the new Lohengrin at the 2018 Bayreuth Festival, is back with family in his native Poland. Embracing the solitude in their retreat in the Giant Mountains National Park, the singer informed his 36,000 Instagram faithful of \"a place that always calms us and fills us with energy.\"\nNo appearance in Bayreuth this year: Piotr Beczala (l.) as Lohengrin in 2018\n\"We were all suddenly forced to stop in this constant race we call life,\" Beczala continued in a post from April 2. \"Maybe this is our chance to rethink our lives and our priorities, devote more attention to what we miss in our daily rush — the closeness of our loved ones, the beauty of the nature that surrounds us, the joy of small pleasures. Please look after yourself and each other, and try to make the most of this #timeathome.\"\nSinging for a good cause\nOf course, many in the opera business are having a rough time. \"But how to earn a living when the show's not going on? Low tide in the wallet leaves many artists fearful,\" continues Jonas Kaufmann's corona ditty.\nHe is well aware that he and his star colleagues still have it very good compared to less renowned freelance singers, musicians, directors and others who are hired and paid exclusively for individual projects or performances.\nSocial distancing on the opera stage isn't easy: Jonas Kaufmann and Kristine Opolais (2014 in \"Manon Lescaut\", London)\nKaufmann thus combines his serenade with an appeal to all opera fans to especially support these opera workers via the website saengerhilfe.de (Help for singers).\n\"Dear opera and concert enthusiasts, wherever you are, I know there are many problems right now,\" he writes in the Instagram post accompanying his corona song video. \"Even so, I would like to ask you: If you're interested in enjoying such a varied and high-quality range of culture in Germany in the future, please donate ... I can assure you, your ears will be grateful for it!\"\nOlga Peretyatko takes a deep breath and looks forward to when it's all over\nTake a deep breath\nBerlin-based singers Anna Prohaska and Olga Peretyatko are also trying to make the most of the lockdown. While Anna Prohaska rehearses new parts and sings for passersby from her balcony, Olga Peretyatko gives Instagram lessons on breathing techniques that strengthen the lungs and help to cope with stress.\nPeople without artistic ambitions can benefit from them, too: Take a deep breath, exhale slowly, pay attention to yourself, sing silently, think positively. The techniques also help against corona depression. Now is the time to try them out.\nOne of the world's top tenors, feted on opera and concert stages across the world, Kaufmann looks back on a quarter century of stellar singing — and shows no sign of slowing down.

You are lounging on a faraway beach and have nothing to do but listen to the sound of rolling waves. The confining walls, niggling tasks and dreary routines in your life are but distant memories. In their place, palm trees rustle and turquoise water stretches to the horizon. A beautiful somebody relaxes at your side, safe and free.\nIf this sounds like an upgrade on life in lockdown, you now know why the marketing for Corona beer has been so successful. In the 1980s Grupo Modelo, the Mexican brewer that created it, began exporting Corona to the United States, projecting an image of “fun, sun and beach”. Unlike branding for other beers, which merely invited drinkers to unwind, Corona offered escape. Save for Huawei, a Chinese telecoms mammoth, Corona is the most valuable global brand not from the rich world, according to Interbrand, a consultant. Or it was: 2020 has been riddled with rotten luck.\nStart with a brutal clash of names a century in the making. Grupo Modelo began producing Corona in Mexico City in the 1920s. The crown that adorns the beer’s label and bottle-cap first appeared in 1963. Around that time, virologists crouched over microscopes in southern England identified a new kind of pathogen in humans. Its distinctive petal-like patterns on its edges “recall[ed] the solar corona”, wrote Nature in 1968. Soon afterwards, Corona beer began to conquer the world; by 2018, estimated Forbes, its sales reached $6.6bn. The coronavirus group bided its time.\nIn 2020, thanks to the pandemic, the word “corona” has ceased to be the plaything of marketeers at AB InBev, the giant brewer that bought Grupo Modelo in 2013. The term is now a battlefield on which glamour and calamity collide. Whether “corona”, a year or two from now, elicits thoughts of beaches and limes or of hospital beds and quarantines, is potentially a question worth billions.\nThe first shots fired in this battle were jokes. As the coronavirus spread, amateur comedians flocked to the images of far-flung exotica posted daily on Corona’s Instagram account. Some sardonically urged the brewer to “please stop killing innocent people”. Others suggested that Corona change its name to something with fewer negative connotations, “like Ebola”. Corona’s social-media team stopped posting on March 13th. It is safe to say that a lengthy furlough awaits them.\nCould the bad vibes from the coronavirus prove more than a passing joke? Many experts in marketing psychology are sceptical. The term “coronavirus” will probably become less salient with time. “Corona” is not uniquely tied to the beer, which shares its name with a neighbourhood in New York and the sun’s aura; corona is also Spanish for “crown”. It may help that Corona is drunk mostly by the young, many of whom regard the pandemic as a nuisance rather than a trauma.\nAnd yet Corona’s custodians must wonder if their beer will get through this unscathed. A brand’s power lies in its ability to trigger subconscious associations in consumers’ minds. But who can now hear the word “corona” without thinking of plague? At best, that may dilute Corona’s escape-to-the-beach message. At worst, it could drown it, getting consumers to think of suffering rather than pleasure, quarantine boredom rather than coastal escape, and of disease or bad hygiene. Many cite the unfortunate precedent of Ayds, a weight-loss candy whose sales plummeted in the 1980s. Its makers changed its name.\nThere are some ominous signs. This year Corona’s “buzz score”—a measure compiled by YouGov, a pollster, tracking whether people have heard positive and negative things about brands—has fallen by a third, to its lowest ever. But any evidence of lasting damage to the brand would be slow to emerge, points out Tom Meyvis, a professor of marketing at the Stern School of Business, at New York University. Market research amid a lockdown is unreliable, as is purchasing behaviour during a global recession. Sales at Constellation Brands, which makes and distributes Corona for drinkers in the United States, were “superb” in March, Bill Newlands, its chief executive, told CNBC, though “some of that’s obviously pantry loading” ahead of a lockdown.\nThose who know Corona note that it has defied the odds to reach the top. Mexico had no beer-making pedigree with which to win foreign drinkers’ trust, but images of Mexican beaches soon became a novel, glamorous and world-beating selling-point. Corona’s transparent glass bottle causes the beer to spoil easily when exposed to sunlight, but a “nothing to hide” marketing slogan was a hit. On hearing that Californians were putting a slice of lime in the bottle before drinking it, Corona’s master brewers were horrified it would ruin the taste and wanted it stopped. It is now a cherished rite for drinkers across the world.\nThe beer’s success abroad has mattered deeply for its homeland. Its rise occurred in tandem with the opening of the Mexican economy. Corona took advantage of loosening trade barriers to enter new markets, and became a national ambassador for Mexico in faraway places. By the 1990s the secretary for commerce, Jaime Serra Puche, was boasting that “Mexico exports two fluids: crude oil and Corona”. It was perhaps the first product that asked Americans and others to pay more, rather than less, for something with a “Made in Mexico” label. That forged a path for other Mexican wares, from tequilas to tacos, to be branded as “high-end”.\nIt is a happy story curtailed by the unlucky events of 2020. But Corona’s woes this year go beyond its name. On March 21st and 22nd a controversial Corona brewery for Constellation Brands, already under construction in Mexicali, on Mexico’s border with California, was put to a public vote. Opponents said the brewery used too much water in a dry region. Constellation said its pledge to pay for fixing the region’s leaky pipes meant the water supply would be improved rather than imperilled. Mexicali’s mayor, Marina del Pilar Ávila Olmeda, said the debate around the brewery “has been politicised”, and that a decision to scrap it would affect the “legal certainty” that foreign investors seek in Mexico and cities like Mexicali. Turnout for the vote, at just 36,781 in a city of nearly 1m people, was itself depressed by the coronavirus. Of those, 76% voted to scupper the plant.\nIn the days before the referendum your correspondent visited the brewery site, 20 minutes’ drive south of Mexicali’s centre. The towering tanks were already built and painted creamy white, with a strip of Corona Gold on the top. Fields of dirt were soon to become car parks and offices for the plant’s 3,000 workers. Constellation had already spent $900m on the $1.4bn project, which now cannot be completed. Constellation, which has two other breweries in northern Mexico to serve thirsty Americans, is now unsure where—or whether—to build a replacement. For the first time, the Corona Americans drink might not be brewed only in Mexico.\nWorse was to come for Corona in April, when the Mexican government belatedly ordered the closure of all non-essential activities. Unlike making wine in France or beer in the United States, brewing in Mexico was declared “non-essential”. Within weeks the national supply of Corona dried up. Your correspondent’s local supermarket in Mexico City has neither Corona nor any other domestic brew left on its shelves; there are only a few imported beers to choose from. Some of Corona’s moribund breweries have taken to filling up their iconic clear bottles with drinking water and delivering them to the poor.\nBut what is Corona to do about its biggest headache? For now both AB InBev and Constellation are staying silent. Any public recognition of the association between the virus and the beer is a no-no. “By acknowledging it you strengthen it,” says Mr Meyvis. To change the name of such a powerful brand would be dangerous, too. It would not only undo decades of hard work, but also destroy the beer’s sense of authenticity and history—which customers also prize. But if damage to the brand is unavoidable, its owners could do worse than pick Coronita, the beer’s name in Spain (the result of a trademark dispute). It preserves the brand’s identity, and it might just be enough of a change to get drinkers’ imaginations back on the beach, where they belong.■\nDig deeper:\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus tracker and story hub"}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/03/23/russian-medical-specialist-suspected-of-working-while-infected-a69726", "title": "Russian Medical Specialist Suspected of Working While Infected", "text": "Russian investigators opened a criminal case on Monday against a top infections specialist who tested positive for the coronavirus after visiting Spain but neglecting to self-isolate afterwards.\nThe negligence probe was launched after an infectious disease professor and top health care consultant in the southern Stavropol region became patient zero for the coronavirus there, exposing hundreds to the virus.\nThe woman \"went on holiday to Spain, where she was from March 6 to 9, without telling her superiors\" and did not self-isolate after her return, Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement.\nShe \"continued her usual routine, giving lectures in the university, attending conferences\" and was eventually diagnosed after she went into hospital on March 17 because she was feeling unwell, the statement said.\nLocal governor Vladimir Vladimirov confirmed the patient's infection in an Instagram post on Sunday, as angry commentators called for her to be put on trial and banned from working again in medicine.\nBy Monday, some 350 people who have been in contact with the woman were under monitoring, with at least 11 suspected of having contracted COVID-19, regional officials said.\nRussia has so far reported 438 new coronavirus infections, most of them in Moscow.

In St Mark’s Square in Venice, pigeons outnumber tourists. Madrid is closing prestigious art museums, including the Prado and the Reina Sofía. Beijing’s Forbidden City has been shut for weeks. Football matches are being played in front of empty stands.\nThe quarantines and directives to avoid travel set up in response to covid-19, a new disease, have reduced visits to tourist sites. But do these eerie images reflect a broad retreat from public spaces? Data from Google show that the virus has indeed prompted a sharp decline in overall foot traffic. They also suggest that shops and restaurants in places where covid-19 is now taking root should prepare for similar slowdowns.\nBy tracking mobile phones, Google constantly estimates how busy places are relative to historical averages. For example, Rome’s central train station, Termini, is typically most crowded at 9am on Fridays. Google assigns this peak level a value of 100, and expresses footfall at other times as a share of this maximum. The average value throughout the week at Termini is 30.\nMarch 6th, however, was an unusual Friday. Even though Rome was not yet subject to an official lockdown, at 9am that day Google reported a foot-traffic level at Termini of just 31, 69 points below the average for that time. The pattern was similar at other times, and at 14 other stations and 11 museums in Rome—though the declines were steeper in tourist areas than in places frequented by locals. In total, Rome’s metro was about one-third less busy during the past week than normal, the biggest drop-off among the 18 cities we tracked. Moreover, the decline in Rome’s pedestrian traffic sharpened from 15% when the week began to around 50% when it ended.\nRome is the capital of a country with a dire outbreak, but it reflects a broad pattern. From March 3rd to 11th, footfall at metro stations was below the usual rate in 12 of the 18 cities. Among those 12, the average drop was 15%. The other cities with big dips were mainly in Asia, where covid-19 began.\nIn some Asian cities, the rate of new cases has fallen and normal life is resuming. Foot traffic in Hong Kong returned to standard levels on March 7th. Conversely, metro stations in New York are as busy as ever, just as the city’s outbreak gathers speed. If its counterparts elsewhere are any guide, the worst lies ahead.■\nSources: Google; Johns Hopkins CSSE; The Economist\nThis article appeared in the Graphic detail section of the print edition under the headline \"Ghost towns\""}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/03/05/what-the-world-has-learned-about-facing-covid-19", "title": "Firstest with the mostest - What the world has learned about facing covid - 19 | Briefing", "text": "SPEAKING FROM his home in Abuja, Chikwe Ihekweazu, the director general of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, says China has one big lesson to teach the world about covid-19: “It can be contained.” Mr Ihekweazu was in voluntary self-isolation following a visit to Wuhan, the city at the centre of the Chinese outbreak, as part of a group of experts dispatched by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to examine the country’s measures to stop the spread of covid-19.\nThese measures seem to have had significant success. On February 4th China recorded 3,887 new cases. On March 4th the number was 139. The report that the WHO group published on February 28th put the good results down to the way that the state had used manpower and technology to implement quarantine meticulously on an unprecedented scale. It did not go into the disturbing mechanisms of state power employed to that end.\nAll over the country cities closed down schools, public transport and almost all social and economic activity to stop people from moving around. In Wuhan, a city of 11m people, the population has been restricted to their homes for five weeks. The lockdown was enforced not just by the network of officials which covers every block of flats, street and alley but also, under the influence of those officials, by the property managers at residential compounds. In some villages life is now relatively unconstrained; there are reports that in others every visitor has to be cleared by a local party boss. The top-down set-up lends itself to excessive alacrity among the lower echelons. Missing a target is more dangerous than overstepping the mark. Hence the (swiftly censored) online videos showing police smashing Mahjong tables, people being paraded or tied to trees for failing to wear face-masks, or a screaming woman barricaded in her home with iron bars.\nHow less thuggish states can achieve similar results remains to be seen. In South Korea, the country with the most cases outside China, stringent measures widely supported by the public may be slowing the rate of spread. A drop has definitely been seen in Singapore, where pandemic preparedness became a priority after the SARS outbreak of 2003. The city-state knows where all but 12 of the 112 cases it has seen got infected.\nBut whether the isolation of whole towns in northern Italy has done much to curb the outbreak there remains to be seen. In Iran there is no evidence as yet of any overarching control at all. And in America the response to date has been a shambolic missed opportunity. Shockingly, the worst American bungling has more in common with the catastrophic early stages of the Chinese epidemic—when officials minimised risks and punished truth-tellers, thus letting the disease spread much further and faster than it might have—than with the country’s later co-ordinated control efforts.\nThe wrong controls\nIn the week from February 26th to March 4th the number of countries and territories reporting cases of covid-19 rose from 50 to 85 (see map). Most, so far, have fewer than a dozen cases, mostly imported from or directly linked to cases in China, Iran, Italy and South Korea, which between them accounted for 91,903 of the 95,124 confirmed cases as of March 4th (see chart). Low case numbers, though, should not be taken to signify successful containment; they are often a measure of ignorance.\nTake America. On February 25th Larry Kudlow, chief economic adviser to President Donald Trump, told reporters that “We have contained this. I won’t say airtight, but it’s pretty close to airtight.” As he spoke a cluster of cases at a care facility in Washington state was showing that America’s public-health agencies had been caught flat footed. Test kits made available by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were faulty; restrictions were limiting tests in other settings. By March 1st, when South Korea had run 100,000 tests for the virus, America—which saw its first case on January 23rd—had run fewer than 500.\nThe WHO team urged all countries which have seen any cases to follow China in carrying out as much testing as they could, especially of unexplained pneumonia cases and flu-like symptoms in patients who seem not to be infected with the flu virus. “Test and you shall find,” says Gabriel Leung of the University of Hong Kong, who was also on the WHO team. “You either test and find it early, and do something about it, or the body bags are going to pile up,” he adds.\nThat dire warning has not yet born bitter fruit in under-tested America, but it could. As of March 4th, there were cases in 14 American states. Some of them, such as that of a New York lawyer and his family, have no obvious connection to any of the four high-incidence countries, strongly suggesting that there are what epidemiologists call silent chains of transmission in the country. In a population without measures in place to control such chains, a single undiagnosed case can, in principle, give rise to more than 3,000 cases six weeks later. On March 4th, while Mr Trump blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the CDC’s problems, Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, revealed he had asked 1,000 people in Westchester, where the infected lawyer lives, to isolate themselves.\nIn South Korea, by contrast, the government is being forthright and formidably transparent, allowing Koreans to trace their possible brushes with the disease. As well as briefing the press thoroughly twice a day, and texting reporters details of every death, the government puts online a detailed record of each new patient’s movements over previous days and weeks, allowing people to choose to shun the places they visited. The risk of illicit activity being thus uncovered—at least one extramarital affair may have been—gives people an extra incentive to avoid exposure to a disease which, in most of the infected, results in only mild symptoms.\nNo Roman candles\nAcross the country, schools are closed and public gatherings cancelled. Though neither Daegu nor Cheongdo, the cities which saw the first clustered outbreaks, were ever completely locked down, more than 9,000 people in Daegu were quarantined. As in China, where personal data from electronic payment and social media apps have been used by the authorities to track people’s movements and estimate their chances of infection, phones play a role in South Korea, too. The government has produced an app which reports on quarantined people’s movements and can alert authorities if they abscond. Officials call regularly to check in on people.\nSouth Korea has powers that put very little weight on its citizens’ privacy; some aspects of its response might be hard to mount in other democracies. But in countries where there is a high level of trust in government, some strong measures will be supported. When SARS hit Toronto in 2003 only 23 of almost 30,000 people placed under quarantine refused to comply. Asked in a survey how serious a crime or misdemeanour they thought breaking quarantine was, half of Canadians ranked it as similar to manslaughter. In all the countries questioned about their attitudes to quarantine in an Ipsos MORI poll at the end of February, a majority said that they would back quarantines if the government called for them. In Canada, the majority was 78%, one of the largest seen. In Italy it was only 60%, the smallest.\nThat seems to reflect national levels of trust. Last June polling by the Wellcome Trust, a charity, found that 78% of Canadians said they trusted government health advice. In Germany and Britain the number was over 80% and in South Korea a remarkable 86%. In Italy it was just 63%; in America, worryingly, lower still at 59%. Italians will need to wait a bit to discover if their government’s response has deserved what trust they have accorded it. According to Walter Ricciardi, a leading public-health expert in Rome, it will take until the middle of March to know whether sealing towns with outbreaks off into two “red zones” has worked to slow the virus’s spread. It cannot be good news that over 400 cases have now been diagnosed in an area around the city of Bergamo, north of Milan. On March 4th the government announced it was closing schools and universities until March 15th.\nIf a quarantine is to enjoy public support, the people it shuts away need to be well looked after. Economically, those in Italy may be: the government has put aside €3.6bn ($4bn) to cover the epidemic’s costs. Some of it is earmarked to help exporters such as the doubly unlucky Erik Granzon. Not only is his fireworks company suffering the inconvenience of life in one of the two red zones; it also lost €300,000 last week when big displays were cancelled in Qatar and Milan so as to limit opportunities for further infection.\nSome in the other red zone have more pressing problems. In a video posted to YouTube on March 3rd, Costantino Pesatori, the mayor of Castiglione d’Adda, a village of 4,650 inhabitants, said: “We feel truly alone. People are ill and are not receiving the necessary assistance. Help us please.” There are around 100 infections among the villagers; there have been 15 deaths. Mr Pesatori told The Economist that all three doctors in the village were in quarantine and a locum had “no gloves, no mask, no overalls—nothing to protect him.” He is begging the authorities to open consulting rooms at two local hospitals or send in army doctors.\nA lack of supplies is being reported elsewhere in the red zones, too. In nearby Casalpusterlengo, Anna Rossi, a pharmacist, says she has no disinfectant gel to sell her customers, nor any masks capable of stopping contagion. On March 2nd a group of general practitioners wrote to the health minister in Rome that they too lacked protective equipment. “We want to stay at our patients’ sides,” they wrote. “But how can we do so effectively if we are not given the minimal means with which to defend them and defend ourselves?”\nThis looks like being a problem more widely. The WHO says the world’s health-care workers will need 89m medical masks a month to deal with covid-19. Because production is currently only about 70% of that there are shortages, and prices have gone up six-fold. Germany, Russia, Taiwan and Thailand have restricted exports of masks to protect their domestic supplies. China, which last year made half the world’s face masks, has not banned exports. But in practice they have, understandably, ground to a halt.\nMasks of sorrows\nProduction, though, has rocketed—as it could elsewhere, if politicians forced it to. According to the government, China is now making 116m face masks a day, 12 times the production a month ago, with 1.7m of them the high-performance sort that health-care workers need when faced with patients coughing and sneezing. A General Motors joint venture in south-western China is making both its own disposable face masks and face-mask-making machinery for the many other companies doing the same. There are no precise figures for the production of tests, but the number carried out suggests that it, too, has soared.\nSome populations will not be able to afford to test at the necessary rates—or to hospitalise large numbers of patients. In Africa, which currently has very few cases, a big emphasis on tracking cases at this early stage in the epidemic could serve to limit the absolute number of infections, avoiding wherever possible the extensive community transmission that seems to have taken off in Iran. Bitter experience of other epidemics means that some African countries are well set up for this. Mr Ihekweazu’s teams go out to investigate a new disease outbreak of some sort almost every week with the help of SORMAS, an open-source data-logging app used by health workers.\nThat said, although covid-19 has become a major priority, it is not the overriding concern it could be. Mr Ihekweazu notes that Nigeria is currently experiencing the largest spike in Lassa fever cases it has ever seen; Africa also has a high burden of the world’s most deadly respiratory disease, tuberculosis. Most of Mr Ihekweazu’s team is focused on the new virus, but some remain ring-fenced for other areas “so that we don’t drop the ball.”\nIn places where the covid-19 ball is being dropped, or has been dropped already, the sort of self-isolation being urged in Westchester will be crucial to slowing the spread of the disease. In Britain statutory sick pay, normally not applicable until the fourth day of absence, will now be paid from the first to encourage people to stay at home if they think they need to. That said, the pay is not generous and does not cover the lowest paid.\nIn America both the health-care system and paid-leave laws are poorly configured for epidemics. Public-health authority is mostly devolved to state and city health agencies, creating a patchwork system of control. Preparedness, funding and sophistication all vary by county and hospitals, meaning that response and care could become uneven.\nThe patchwork system could be especially problematic if it leads to sick people showing up to work when they should not. Few lower-income workers in service-sector jobs have the option of paid sick leave available to them. The prospect of lost wages—and potentially a lost job—could be enough to persuade them to attend work rather than stay at home feeling a bit ill but increasingly poor. A study of paid sick-leave mandates in America by Stefan Pichler and Nicholas Ziebarth, two economists, found that the policy reduced the spread of influenza by 5% in normal times and 40% during a wave. Assuming that covid-19 is comparable, that calculation suggests that the 39 states that do not require paid sick leave risk a worsened crisis.\nThe second big problem is that, because pandemic preparedness is not generally billable, American hospitals do not keep spare infectious-disease capacity. “We’re already running our health-care systems razor-thin in terms of capacity. There’s very little excess capacity in people, beds...or protective equipment,” says Michael Osterholm, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Minnesota. A lack of preparedness has already forced the quarantine of 124 staff because of a single patient in California.\nAt the patient level, the costs of medical testing and treatment could act as a hindrance to effective containment. There are already widely circulating reports of worried patients showing up to emergency rooms for testing who are leaving with medical bills for thousands of dollars. More than a quarter of the 28m uninsured Americans say they have put off medical care they cannot afford. The Trump administration is said to be considering routing disaster-relief funds towards reimbursing the uninsured, which would ease things. The implications for the un- and under-insured of the $8.3bn “supplemental appropriation” passed by the House on March 4th are not clear.\nPay attention\nNot all countries can be as well prepared as Singapore: rich enough to pledge S$5.6bn ($4bn)—as much as Italy—to blunt the disease’s economic impacts, well organised enough to enforce pretty strict measures and shaken by SARS into taking such things seriously. Yet Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister, still worried in February that the costs would eclipse those of SARS. Lawrence Wong, co-chair of the ministerial task force on covid-19, warns that “all it takes is one incident, one event, and there is a sharp spike in cases and sustained transmission.” Everyone has things to learn. Some have more than others. ■\nThis article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline \"New world curriculum\""}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/20/coronavirus-hits-russian-psychiatric-hospital-a70040", "title": "Coronavirus Hits Russian Psychiatric Hospital", "text": "Dozens of patients and staff have been infected with the coronavirus at a psychiatric hospital in Russia’s northwestern Arkhangelsk region, leading to a sharp rise in local cases, Interfax reported Sunday, citing regional authorities.\nThe Arkhangelsk state clinical psychiatric hospital was placed under quarantine Saturday when one of its employees was found to be infected.

An unofficial tally kept by colleagues lists 11 St. Petersburg medics who have died after contracting Covid-19.\nSt. Petersburg has confirmed 5,346 coronavirus cases since the outbreak began, third among Russia’s regions and almost 4% of the 145,268 nationwide cases reported as of Monday."}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-tests/washington-state-urges-patience-as-covid-19-test-delays-stoke-anger-idUSKBN20S096", "title": "Washington state urges patience as Covid - 19 test delays stoke anger", "text": "(Reuters) - Washington state officials urged patience on Wednesday as medical staff reported fear and anger among people told they could not be tested for the coronavirus due to limited capacity in a state facing the United States’ deadliest outbreak.\nClinics in the Seattle area reported an increase in patients seeking tests as Washington reported 39 cases of coronavirus and 10 deaths.\nHealth officials and front-line medical staff in Seattle’s King County, the location of most cases, asked mildly sick people to stay home rather than inundate clinics and hospitals for tests and risk infecting others.\n“We know there is huge demand out there for testing, we know there are a lot of people in our state who are sick and they want to know if they have Covid-19,” Washington State Health Officer Kathy Lofy told a news conference. “I want to tell you we are doing everything possible to expand testing capacity here in our state.”\nNurse practitioner Paula Ruedebusch asked patients not to take out frustrations on front-line medical staff.\n“We have had patients presenting here, angry that they cannot be tested for COVID-19, yelling, cussing, throwing their dirty mask at us and even spitting their secretions on the floor and walls on their way out,” Ruedebusch, who works at an urgent care clinic in the Seattle suburb of Monroe, wrote on Facebook.\nTesting was delayed after a first round of kits sent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) failed and it took weeks for replacements to arrive in states.\nThe CDC initially set narrow criteria on who could be tested but widened them in the last day to anyone who has symptoms of Covid-19, Lofy said.\nWashington still faces capacity issues, with the state public health laboratory only able to test around 100 people a day, Lofy said. The state hopes to ramp up testing through commercial labs.\nHealth officials are concerned that clinics and hospitals could be overwhelmed, said Patty Hayes, King County public health director.\n“We do not want the situation that has been seen in other areas, in other countries where the healthcare system was overloaded, and unable to cope,” said Hayes.\nTo slow the virus’ spread, county officials recommended on Wednesday that residents avoid gatherings of more than 10 people and urged sick or elderly people to stay home.\nMegan Farnsworth said patient volume was high at two Seattle-area walk-in clinics she directs, but not at record levels.\nMuch of her staff’s work is easing people’s fears and telling them to stay home and monitor their symptoms, she said.\n“Honestly, patients are just scared and want someone in the healthcare field to tell them something that they can believe,” said Farnsworth, a doctor with Providence Regional Medical Center Everett.\nGraphic - Tracking the novel coronavirus: here\nReporting by Andrew Hay in New Mexico; Editing by Bill Tarrant and Peter Cooney"}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/15/waiting-for-the-coronavirus-tsunami-to-hit-st-petersburg-a69997", "title": "Waiting for the  Coronavirus Tsunami  to Hit St . Petersburg", "text": "A huge tent stands in the courtyard of St. Petersburg Hospital No. 2 — an extra emergency ward if the hospital receiving ward can’t cope with a surge of coronavirus cases. The hospital, one of the city’s largest, has 1,200 beds. At the end of March, the director was told to get ready to receive Covid-19 patients, train its staff and stock up inventories.\nSt. Petersburg’s Covid-19 statistics are less dire than Moscow’s. The number of confirmed cases has been fluctuating between 35 and 120 per day over the past week, in contrast with Moscow’s number rising to over 3,000 new cases a day. On April 14, 799 cases had been confirmed in St. Petersburg.\nSo far, the tent has not been used. But the hospital’s staff say they are in the “calm before the storm.”\nWhat they don’t know is how devastating the Covid-19 tsunami will be when it hits.\nA day in the new life\n“We are torn between hope and uncertainty, and the uncertainty is really the hardest part right now,” Pyotr Puzdryak told The Moscow Times. Puzdryak is a vascular surgeon who was retrained to deal with infectious diseases.\n“We are sailing through troubled waters. There is so much we don’t know for a fact, from the true numbers of people infected and recovered — a lot of people must have already had Covid-19 without even noticing — to how many people had it and died before testing began. With both the Chinese and the Italian scenarios in front of us, we are doing the best we can with what we have to avoid a disaster.”\nUp to 270 ambulance vehicles arrive at the hospital per day, most with patients showing symptoms of Covid-19, pneumonia or acute respiratory syndrome, he said.\nPuzdryak and his colleagues are on 24-hour shifts. The protocol is 20 minutes per patient in the emergency ward, where he is assigned. All the routines have been changed to deal with the Covid-19 emergency. Everyone on staff gets their temperature checked every day and takes a coronavirus test once a week.\n“The training helped a lot, thanks to our chief doctor Vladimir Volchkov, who had first-hand experience creating infection wards in past flu epidemics,” Puzdryak said. “But there is a lot to learn and get used to, like how to work in gear that is like a spacesuit for many hours without food, water and bathroom runs. Or how to how to use a phonendoscope — a stethoscope that amplifies sound — without touching your face, and how to find veins when you’re wearing thick goggles that fog over when you breathe.”\nReady or not\nWhen the hospital was ordered to start operating as an infectious diseases center in the end of March, there was a serious shortage of just about all protective gear, from airtight respirator masks to surgical gowns and eye gear, Puzdryak said. “Given the dire shortages of basic personal protection equipment, I thought a lot of my colleagues were just going to resign,” he said. “But no one quit. There is a strong sense of camaraderie and mutual support. The attitude ‘if not us, who?’ was stronger than everyone’s fears.”\nAccording to the St. Petersburg Health Committee, the city’s hospitals currently have 1,784 ventilators, and the local government has announced tenders to buy more. Earlier this month St. Petersburg governor Alexander Beglov said the city would need a further 1,600 ventilators in a bad-case scenario.\n“At the moment, we are fully stocked with equipment, including ventilators and personal protective gear, which is, I must admit, a huge relief. We know that this is not the case in all Russian clinics.”\nTo keep spirits high, the hospital staff send each other corona memes. One of them shows Death spraying disinfectant over her scythe, cursing the panic.\nBut Puzdryak doesn’t see much panic. “I don’t see it much among the patients who come in, although the situation must be terrifying: doctors and nurses dressed like cosmonauts, and everyone knows there is no easy cure,” he said. “But people are upset to be separated from their families. No visits are allowed, and people know they will have to get through this on their own.”\nIf the virus doesn’t get you, starvation will\nWhat does upset the staff is how hard it has been to motivate the Russian people to stay home. “Thousands of people fear losing income much more than they fear catching the virus,” Puzdryak said. “I read in the news that many people are already facing unemployment, unpaid leave, crippling debts and instant poverty — and they see that prospect as another form of death.”\nBusinesses, which have been most affected by restrictions introduced by the government in an effort to handle the pandemic, have so far only been given the option of putting off some of the payments they are required to make. The measure has been called a “suspended sentence” by some entrepreneurs, who already have mounting debts.\nA lot of Russians remember the economic reforms of 1990s, when Russia's population shrank and the annual death rate exceeded the birth rate. The country was hit by a wave of unemployment, poverty and crime.\n“The truth is that in Russia, the topics of the coronavirus and poverty go hand in hand. Just look some of the most popular jokes about Covid-19,” Puzdryak said.\nA popular one making the rounds in St. Petersburg is: The Russian Pension Fund cares for you. They give you small pensions so you can’t waste money on gambling or traveling to dangerous places, like China and Italy.\nIn one illustrative recent incident, St. Petersburg entrepreneur Alexander Zatulivetrov, the owner of several restaurants, announced on April 9, that he would open his eateries, come what may, on April 15, under the slogan “I am as safe as a bank or the metro.”\n“We don’t have a strong lobby,” he wrote on social media. “But think how many people work for us! These are people who don’t have a single chance of getting a bank loan. The banks have lost their consciences. If you care as much as I do, please join me.”\nUnder pressure, he had to cancel his plans.\nPublic support\nThe more the virus spreads, the greater the risk that Puzdryak and his colleague will have to do what they dread: make morally wrenching choices to allocate shrinking resources among growing numbers of patients with equal needs.\nIn the meantime, the doctors’ own call for support is being heard by the media, the public and private donors. After the doctors at St. Petersburg’s Pokrovskaya Hospital posted a video on YouTube on April 3 showing their catastrophic lack of individual protective gear, the reaction was powerful and immediate, from media campaigns to direct donations of masks from Leningrad rock band frontman Sergei Shnurov, the Yabloko party and private donors.\nGrassroots campaigns under the slogans like “Support Doctors!” and “We’re together!” have sprung up all over the city. Private companies are providing gear, food and water which volunteers deliver to the hospitals daily. “I talk to doctors at St. George Hospital a lot, and they say volunteers bring them hot meals,” Puzdryak said. “We’ve never heard so many warm words of encouragement before. I can’t even say how much it means to us.”"}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-fake-idUSKBN208028", "title": "Fake news makes disease outbreaks worse , study finds", "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - The rise of “fake news” - including misinformation and inaccurate advice on social media - could make disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic currently spreading in China worse, according to research published on Friday.\nIn an analysis of how the spread of misinformation affects the spread of disease, scientists at Britain’s East Anglia University (UEA) said any successful efforts to stop people sharing fake news could help save lives.\n“When it comes to COVID-19, there has been a lot of speculation, misinformation and fake news circulating on the internet – about how the virus originated, what causes it and how it is spread,” said Paul Hunter, a UEA professor of medicine who co-led the study.\n“Misinformation means that bad advice can circulate very quickly – and it can change human behavior to take greater risks,” he added.\nIn their research, Hunter’s team focused on three other infectious diseases - flu, monkeypox and norovirus – but said their findings could also be useful for dealing with the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.\n“Fake news is manufactured with no respect for accuracy, and is often based on conspiracy theories,” Hunter said.\nFor the studies - published on Friday in separate peer-reviewed journals - the researchers created theoretical simulations of outbreaks of norovirus, flu and monkeypox.\nTheir models took into account studies of real behavior, how different diseases are spread, incubation periods and recovery times, and the speed and frequency of social media posting and real-life information sharing.\nThey also took into account how lower trust in authorities is linked to tendency to believe conspiracies, how people interact in “information bubbles” online, and the fact that “worryingly, people are more likely to share bad advice on social media than good advice from trusted sources,” Hunter said.\nThe researchers found that a 10% reduction in the amount of harmful advice being circulated has a mitigating impact on the severity of an outbreak, while making 20% of a population unable to share harmful advice has the same positive effect.\nReporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Frances Kerry"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/27caa625ab05ed55906bed9c562abe60", "title": "New York governor confirms state 2nd case of COVID - 19 .

The funds would be common and would come from the European Investment Bank. This would be mutualised debt, taken collectively by all member states of the European Union.\"\nNine EU countries have called for such bonds to be issued: Spain, Italy, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Slovenia.\nA common Eurobond would mean money would be borrowed jointly, but it could be used by financially disadvantaged countries, ETV's \"Aktuaalne kaamera\" reported on Wednesday night.\n\"This is an old wish that Southern Europe can make its loose fiscal policy in solidarity with others.

Take South Korea which, until recently overtaken by Italy, had the highest number of covid-19 infections outside China. Of 7,869 diagnosed cases, three-fifths trace back to a sect called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.\nShincheonji’s 88-year-old founder, Lee Man-hee, is said to descend from ancient Korean kings. As the “Promised Pastor”, he is uniquely able to interpret the Book of Revelation and to foresee the apocalypse it describes. He will take 144,000 followers with him to Heaven on the Day of Judgment, apparently.\nOther Christian leaders call Shincheonji a cult. Many of its 245,000 adherents hide their membership from family and workmates. At church they worship sitting on the ground in serried ranks, are not allowed to wear glasses—or, at least until recently, face masks—and are encouraged to attend even when ill. In February one congregant with undiagnosed covid-19 infected dozens of worshippers in Daegu, a southern city.\nMr Lee, who has a taste for videos of white chargers and for mass games performed by his followers in stadiums, has become the butt of nationwide invective. He has therefore had to abase himself. Not long ago he blamed the epidemic on evil types jealous of Shincheonji’s success. But at a press conference last week he was on his knees apologising for his church’s role in spreading the virus. Shincheonji, he said, would do everything to help the authorities check its spread. Meanwhile, politicians are grandstanding. The mayor of Seoul wants prosecutors to investigate Mr Lee for murder through negligence. A provincial governor and presidential hopeful showed up with 40 officials at Shincheonji’s headquarters demanding a full list of members.\nWhat of that other cult leader, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un? He also goes in for white chargers, mass games and dodgy family mythology, but is far swifter at spotting threats. In January, soon after reports surfaced of a growing epidemic in China, North Korea slammed its borders shut. The country responded similarly to China’s outbreak of SARS in 2003 and even to the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa in 2014. The measures were much more comprehensive this time. All travel in and out of the country was stopped. Foreigners already in the country, notably diplomats and aid workers, were put in quarantine. Trade across the border with China, three times higher than in 2003, has ground to a halt, including (to judge by rising domestic prices for staples) the huge, officially sanctioned smuggling rackets that get around UN sanctions. North Korea has even refused to take back defectors rounded up by Chinese authorities.\nA nasty virus is yet another foreign threat—like Japanese or American imperialism—against which a loving leader must guard his pure, vulnerable people. The response includes the mobilisation of tens of thousands of “disease-control workers” and the production of “our-style” disinfectants. Vagrants are being rounded up to stop them bringing illness into the capital, Pyongyang. In official pictures Mr Kim, who this week fired off another round of missiles, is the only North Korean not wearing a mask.\nThe question is whether the “super-special” quarantine measures are working. North Korea supposedly has not a single infection. Perhaps its extreme quarantine has worked. As Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University puts it, the regime is readier to see tens of thousands of already malnourished citizens starve to death, as the price of staple foods rises sharply, than it is to let the virus take hold. Mr Lankov predicts pockets of hunger in remoter rural areas and among groups deemed to be disloyal.\nBut with so much cross-border activity before the clampdown, it seems implausible that the virus has been kept wholly at bay. It is impossible to know for sure. One report claims that 200 North Korean soldiers have died from covid-19. If that is true, and anything like the typical ratio of infections to deaths holds true, then tens of thousands of North Koreans have the virus—and the chances of keeping it away from the well-fed elites in Pyongyang are close to zero.\nIf the new coronavirus does take hold, it will ravage the malnourished (including many army conscripts) before anyone else. To Mr Kim, these people are expendable. Nonetheless, the ferocity of his response suggests he is terrified of the virus. A big epidemic would make him look ineffective—something no all-powerful god-king can afford.\nDig deeper:\n- For more coverage of covid-19 see our coronavirus hub\n- The science of the virus\n- Fatality rates for covid-19 could vary enormously\n- How to deal with a new sort of financial shock\n- Should other countries copy Italy’s nationwide lockdown?\nThis article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline \"Apocalypse, but no deliverance\""}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/d305b8c6fcc5ac1f1a6e24382e6769fb", "title": "WHO chief praises China virus fight , urges more from world", "text": "WHO chief praises China’s virus fight, urges more from world\nMUNICH (AP) — The head of the World Health Organization is urging governments to step up their efforts to prepare for the COVID-19 virus and says “it’s impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take.”\nThe U.N. health agency’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told a gathering of international foreign policy and security leaders Saturday that WHO has been encouraged that there has not yet been widespread transmission of the virus outside of China.\n“The steps China has taken to contain the outbreak at its source appear to have bought to the world time,” Tedros told the Munich Security Conference. “We’re encouraged that an international team of experts is now on the ground working closely with Chinese counterparts to understand the outbreak.”\nBut he said the agency is still “concerned by the continued increase in the number of cases in China,” and by reports about the number of health workers who have been infected or died.\n“We’re concerned by the lack of urgency in funding the response from the international community, ...

He was jailed for 26 weeks.\nLeanne Honess-Heather, an RSPCA officer, said she was approached by five boys aged between 16 and 17 as she tried to help a stranded swan at Rush Lyvars fishing lake in Hullon Saturday.

The number of deaths among those infected, known as the fatality rate, remains low but rises among those over 80 years old.\nCoronavirus fatality rate in China\nLooking at the sex ratio, men are more likely to die (2.8%) than women (1.7%).\nThe study also identifies which existing illnesses put patients at risk. It puts cardiovascular disease at number one, followed by diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and hypertension.\nPointing out the risk to medical staff, the paper says that a total of 3,019 health workers have been infected, 1,716 of which were confirmed cases. Five had died by 11 February, which was the last day of data included in the research.\nOn 13 February, China broadened its definition of how to diagnose people, including \"clinically diagnosed cases\" which previously were counted separate from \"confirmed cases\".\nThis is by far the most detailed study of the coronavirus outbreak within China. It gives us incredible insight into what is happening, but the picture is far from complete.\nYou can study only the cases you find, and other scientists have estimated there could be 10 times as many people infected as are ending up in the official statistics. That means the overall death rate is likely to be lower than the one reported in this study.\nThe report also suggests the outbreak peaked in late January, but it is too soon to know for sure.\nWhat this analysis clearly describes is a \"highly contagious\" virus that spreads \"extremely rapidly\" even in the face of an \"extreme response\" by China.\nThat should be a warning to the rest of the world.\nWhat does it say about the future?\nLooking forward, the paper finds that \"the epidemic curve of onset of symptoms\" peaked around 23-26 January before declining up to 11 February.\n- What are the symptoms?\n- 'No change' in virus outbreak despite China spike\n- Apple warns coronavirus will hurt iPhone supplies\nThe study suggests that the downward trend in the overall epidemic curve could mean that \"isolation of whole cities, broadcast of critical information (e.g., promoting hand washing, mask wearing, and care seeking) with high frequency through multiple channels, and mobilization of a multi-sector rapid response teams is helping to curb the epidemic\".\nBut the authors also warn that with many people returning from a long holiday, the country \"needs to prepare for the possible rebound of the epidemic\".\nChina's response to the virus has seen the lockdown of Wuhan - the largest city in Hubei - and the rest of the province as well as severe travel restrictions on movements across the country.\nWhat's happening with the cruise ships?\nThe virus has spread beyond mainland China to countries around the globe and two cruise ships are now confirmed to have been affected.\nThe Diamond Princess was quarantined in the Japanese port of Yokohama on 3 February, after a man from Hong Kong tested positive. More than 450 of the 3,700 people on board have since become infected.\nThe US has begun evacuating its citizens from the vessel.\nOn Tuesday South Korea joined the list of the countries and territories also planning to get their residents out which already includes Canada, Australia, the UK, Israel and Hong Kong.\nA second ship, the MS Westerdam, was turned away by multiple ports around Asia over fears it could be carrying the virus.\nIt was finally cleared to dock in Sihanoukville, Cambodia, after no cases were found on board. Disembarking passengers were personally welcomed by Prime Minister Hun Sen. No one was quarantined.\nHowever, days later, a woman who had been on the ship tested positive after arriving in Malaysia. Huge efforts are now being made to track down the passengers, who have moved on to many different countries including Malaysia and Thailand, but also further afield to the US and Canada.\nSeveral countries have said they will not admit foreign visitors who were on the ship.\nThere are still 255 guests and 747 crew on board the MS Westerdam, while more than 400 passengers have been sent to a hotel in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, to await test results."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/16/stewart-lee-coronavirus-is-ruining-my-happy-memories", "title": "Coronavirus is ruining my happy memories | Stewart Lee", "text": "Coronavirus is ruining my happy memories\nWhy must things change, I wonder? Why can’t they just be the same for ever? It is a common grievance, and one of the main factors that drove the pro-Brexit vote. Thankfully, soon “things” will be able to go back to being “like they were”. A Clarks Commando shoe, with white dog muck in the treads, will moon-stomp on a Remoaner’s face – for ever.\nWords, however, have a habit of changing their meanings, and the fact that I am submitting this week’s column from a medical isolation tent at an undisclosed emergency location proves their fluid nature. Bear with me. Imagine, for example, that I were to come into work and say: “Hello. I am gay today!” Once, not long ago, everyone would have assumed I meant I was happy. But the word “gay” officially transitioned to meaning “homosexual” on 5 July 1960, its new coinage minted by Benny Hill in the Tommy Steele vehicle Light Up the Sky!, a Brechtian comedy about a man trying to get his wedding cake iced by a recidivist Northern Irish baker.\nThe last people to use the word “gay” to mean “happy” were the Flintstones, who were still promising viewers a “gay old time” as recently as 1966. To be fair, The Flintstones was set between 9000 and 2000 BCE, so it is possible they intended to hold up a mirror to the prehistoric attitudes of the era, while not necessarily endorsing them, like how “the ironic standup comedy of ‘The Wokefinder General’” (© Sarah Vine, The Daily Mail, 2020) Ricky Gervais does.\nBy the 80s, however, the word “gay” was an insult in some circles. Indeed, when asked, by Metal Mania magazine in 1986, if he would ever use keyboards in a song, Anthrax’s drummer, Charlie Benante, said: “No. That is gay.” In 1990, I found myself in a music shop watching an instruction video in which Benante explained how some drums were in fact gay. Then, in 1992, I accidentally saw Anthrax live. They had a massive clock on stage, but its speeding hands, intended to illustrate humanity’s race to oblivion, got stuck at 4pm, leaving Anthrax thrashing furiously and for ever in an eternal tea-time time-loop. Which was gay.\nToday, liberal values have been inculcated into society so thoroughly, only the drummer from Anthrax would still use the word “gay” as an insult, and even then only to a musical instrument. The best way to insult homosexuals today is to call them “bumboys”, as we have learned from the sterling work of our prime minister, Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-the-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Girly-Swot Big-Girl’s-Blouse Chicken-frit Hulk-Smash Noseringed-Crusties Death-Humbug Technology-Lessons Surrender-Bullshit French-Turds Dog-Whistle Get-Stuffed FactcheckUK@CCHQ 88%-lies Get-Brexit-Done Bung-A-Bob-For-Big-Ben’s-Bongs Cocaine-Event Johnson.\nLike the word “gay”, the word “Corona” has changed its meaning too. When I thought of “Corona” as a child, I did not think of a planet-ravaging virus. I thought of a colourful range of Welsh carbonated soft drinks, sold in bottles with 10p returnable deposits, and delivered direct to our door by the be-aproned Corona Man himself, And he was a jolly ruddy-faced tradesman, not an embodiment of global viral doom.\nThe Corona Man would park his yellow flatbed truck in the communal car park, and scamper along our row of terraced houses with his basket of joy-inducing psychedelic fizz-milk. But the Corona factory in south Wales closed in 1987, after a eulogy from Tom Jones, who drank an entire bottle of dandelion and burdock and then retched The Last Post in burps into the microphone. It was the Corona Man, incredibly, who taught me how to ride a bike, taking pity on me as I fumbled and fell on the shared grass out front, and perhaps eyeing my obviously single mother, like a tartrazine Robin Askwith. Within a few months of The Corona Man’s brief weekly instruction, I stopped crying and I was stable in the saddle. I was 28 years old. I’m joking, of course.\nAs the 70s shifted into the 80s, Corona’s fortunes wavered, and the humiliating outfits the Corona Man was forced to wear on his Corona round reflected the company’s desperation. In 1979, he delivered dressed as a giant bottle of Corona, his eyes peeping mournfully through tiny slits. By the end, he waddled round in a rubber fat-suit, his face painted bright orange like the anthropomorphised bubbles in the company’s “Let’s Get Fizzical” adverts, and The Corona Man was too ashamed to meet my gaze, despite our former intimacy. I got my fizz fix from cider now, and left for university, never to return. Deliveries ceased.\nLast week, a man came up to me after a standup show in Sheffield. He said he had lived, as a child, in the room I once lived in, in the house where I grew up, after my mum moved to Worcestershire. I suddenly felt humbled. After two-and-a-half hours of pretending to be someone, and something, else, I knew that this stranger would be able to locate me, socially and historically, and that he knew exactly who I really was.\n“Did the man still deliver Corona when you were there?” I asked. “The virus?” the stranger said, “someone delivered a deadly virus to your home? What do you mean?” A mild panic ensued at the merchandise table and people reached for their hand sanitisers before hurrying away. “No. Corona!”, I shouted, “Corona. A man gave it me every week and I drank loads of it. He’ll be dead by now I expect.”\nThis, to be fair, only added to the confusion, and suddenly I found myself spirited away by insistent health officials in protective clothing. Perhaps when boffins christen the next virus, they could spare a thought for the fond childhood memories they may be trampling under their sock-and-sandalled feet.\nStewart Lee’s Snowflake: Tornado is at London’s South Bank Centre in June and July, and is touring nationally now"}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/kenyan-crowd-sourcing-technology-maps-the-corona-crisis/av-53105046", "title": "Kenyan crowd - sourcing technology maps the corona crisis | DW News - latest news and breaking stories | DW", "text": "Ushahidi, a Kenyan tool that has been used to collect data for disaster relief is now being used around the world to navigate the corona crisis."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/6abd8c3d3dc252bfc721efe032679996", "title": "Alabama facility could be backup site for COVID - 19 patients", "text": "Alabama facility could be backup site for COVID-19 patients\nANNISTON, Ala.

That means 66 people in every 100,000 have died from Covid-19. In the US, with a population of around 330 million, it's 19 in every 100,000, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\nBut those figures are \"faulty comparisons\" that have been \"abused\", argues Prof Steven Van Gucht, a Belgian virologist and government spokesman.\n\"That's the difference between public health science and political motivation,\" he explains. \"That's purely inspired by showing how good you are doing, and it's wrong. We are actually reporting in a more correct way.\"\nWhat's different about Belgium?\nBelgian officials say they are counting in a way that no other country in the world is currently doing: counting deaths in hospitals and care homes, but including deaths in care homes that are suspected, not confirmed, as Covid-19 cases.\nAccording to Belgium's latest official figures, out of 7,703 deaths, 53% have been in care homes.\nSome 16% of deaths in care homes were tested positive for coronavirus. The rest are suspected.\nThat means more than 3,500 deaths have been counted as caused by Covid-19, but not confirmed.\nHow do they work it out?\n\"It's based on the assessment of the medical doctor, usually taking into account whether the coronavirus is present in the same care home,\" says Prof Van Gucht.\n\"For example: if you have one or two confirmed cases, then the week after you have 10 deaths in the same home based on similar symptoms.\"\nThey are not tested in the lab, but it's reasonable to assume that these are also Covid-19 related\nPrime Minister Sophie Wilmès recently suggested Belgium may be over-reporting the actual number of cases.\nHowever, Prof Van Gucht says the real number of deaths may still be higher than they are reporting, as he believes they may still be missing a few cases.\nIs it just down to counting?\nAnother factor is that many more people here put loved ones in care homes than elsewhere in Europe.\nOnly the Netherlands and Luxembourg have a higher rate of care home occupancy, relative to their populations.\nLong-term care in Europe\nOver-65s in care per 1,000 people\n|Country|\n|Luxembourg||82|\n|Netherlands||75|\n|Belgium*||71|\n|Germany||54|\n|France||51|\n|UK||44|\n|Poland||12|\nOfficials also acknowledge mistakes were made at the beginning: poor preparation left care home staff lacking personal protective equipment (PPE). That allowed the virus to spread quickly, with devastating effect.\nNow all nursing home staff are issued with masks and protective clothing, and nurses from hospitals and the military have been brought in to help.\nEpidemiologists say they've found a \"remarkable\" observation in care homes, that around 10% of residents have been asymptomatic carriers of the virus and have built up an immunity. A small comfort, but of important scientific value.\nHow long has Belgium been in lockdown?\nSince 18 March all non-essential business has been closed and, apart from emergency workers, people have been asked to stay at home.\nShopping is limited to one person per family. You can leave the house for medical reasons, to walk the dog, or for an hour's exercise with immediate family, or one other person, while maintaining social distancing of at least 1.5m (5ft).\nBelgian police have been enforcing the lockdown, using drones in parks and fines for anyone breaking social distancing rules.\nCheckpoints have been set up at the borders with Luxembourg, France and the Netherlands, allowing through only cross-border workers, or those with an urgent reason to enter Belgium.\nSome cyclists have been fined after taking a ride into the Netherlands, then being stopped by Belgian police on the way back.\nNeighbours with different lockdowns\nAll non-food shops have been closed too, which led to a bizarre incident in the neighbouring towns of Baarle Hertog and Baarle Nassau, where the border line runs through a bargain store called Zeemans.\nThe Dutch half of the shop is open, but the Belgian half has been taped off, with customers unable to get to the men's clothing section.\nUnlike Belgium's policy, the Netherlands has what Prime Minister Mark Rutte described as an \"intelligent lockdown\", with florists, ironmongers, bakeries, clothes and toy stores remaining open.\nThere have been fewer deaths in the Netherlands, despite having a larger population. But unlike Belgium, the Netherlands does not count suspected Covid-19 deaths in care homes.\nI asked the head of Belgium's Covid-19 taskforce, Minister Philippe De Backer, if he thought the Belgian confinement method was more effective than the more relaxed Dutch and Swedish approaches.\nHe told me Swedes were renowned for following government advice, while it was \"a bit more difficult in a country like Belgium\". However, he was generally \"impressed by how Belgians has dealt with the crisis\".\n- Has Sweden got its coronavirus science right?\n- European Parliament shelters 100 homeless women\n- Belgium unveils plans to lift lockdown\nWhat happens next?\nBelgium will lift its lockdown gradually, in four phases. From Monday, fabric stores are being opened so people can buy material to make their own face masks. Masks will be mandatory on public transport.\nSport will be allowed, too, though no more than two people can play together.\nAll other shops will open from Monday 11 May. Schools will restart on 18 May, with a maximum of 10 students per class.\nCafes, restaurants and some tourist attractions will open after 8 June, if there has been no second spike in cases. Trips abroad may also be allowed in early June.\n- A SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?\n- AVOIDING CONTACT: The rules on self-isolation and exercise\n- HOPE AND LOSS: Your coronavirus stories\n- TESTING: Can I get tested for coronavirus?\nHow is Belgium testing?\nTesting for Covid-19 is being done on 10-20,000 people a day, with priority for emergency workers.\nThe taskforce has also finished screening all 210,000 residents and staff in care homes, discovering that 10% of people are infected. There are more than 500 care homes, and roughly half have had an outbreak.\nAntibody tests to detect if people have had the virus will start in mid-May.\nWill Belgium use tracking apps ?\nNot in the short term. Taskforce head Philippe De Backer tells me it's not \"feasible\" at the moment, so they will concentrate on the laborious system of tracing manually.\n\"When people test positive, it activates a call centre, and our staff ask who they've been in contact with, and they will be contacted and may have to self-isolate.\"\nMr De Backer says use of an app requires at least 60% of the nation to take part voluntarily and he believes that is not realistic at the moment.\n\"I've seen reports in Austria where it's around 9-10%. So that means you need to do 90% of the tracking in another way,\" he says.\nAs Belgium gradually lifts its restrictions, 2,000 so-called \"corona detectives\" are being hired, to trace people who have been in contact with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patients.\nWhat has Belgium learned?\nBelgian scientists have started to look at lessons that can be learned, including an analysis of why three cities have had the biggest concentration of cases: Charleroi in the south, and Hasselt and Sint-Truiden in the east.\nEarly indications suggest that local carnivals with big gatherings of people in March may have contributed, along with areas where second-generation Italian populations are high. In the case of Charleroi, experts are studying whether the spread was linked to issues of poverty and deprivation.\nBelgian hospitals have been largely able to cope with the epidemic so far, with a 42% occupancy rate now, but some hospitals in Brussels have been overwhelmed, and have had to move patients elsewhere.\nAs the confinement here slowly ends, September is a worry for officials, as Prof Van Gucht makes clear.\n\"When all the schools are open again after the summer, that's when the virus risks spreading quickly again. That's when I'm more afraid, with winter coming too.\""}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/more-than-1700-health-workers-infected-by-coronavirus-in-china", "title": "More than 1 , 700 health workers infected by coronavirus in China", "text": "More than 1,700 health workers infected by coronavirus in China\nWHO is seeking information after country announced six health professionals had died\n- Coronavirus – latest news\nThe World Health Organization is seeking more information from China about the large numbers of health workers falling sick because of the coronavirus after it was revealed 1,760 of them have tested positive and six have died.\nThis is the first time China has included the specific numbers for healthcare professionals in the data it has provided on the spread of the epidemic. “This is a critical piece of information because health workers are the glue that holds the health system and the outbreak response together,” said the WHO’s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n“We need to know more about these figures, including the time period and circumstances in which the health workers became sick.”\nOn the same day, Egypt reported a case, making it the first country in Africa to do so. The country’s health ministry said the affected person was a foreigner who had been put into isolation at hospital, adding that the WHO had been immediately informed and that all necessary preventative measures had been taken. It did not give the nationality of the affected person or any other details.\nEarlier this month the WHO said it was particularly concerned about high-risk nations with weaker health systems that may lack the facilities to identify cases.\nDoctors and nurses in China are having to adopt makeshift measures to try to protect themselves in the face of dire shortages of protective gowns, gloves and masks, according to the New York Times. Eyewitnesses told of health professionals patching up damaged protective masks with tape and reusing goggles meant to be used once and thrown away. They are wrapping their shoes in plastic bags because they have no protective covers for them.\nSome have used their own money to buy protective gear if they could find it for sale, or begged from friends. Others told of avoiding eating and drinking for long stretches because going to the toilet meant removing and discarding safety gowns that they would not be able to replace.\nTedros pointed out that the WHO had disseminated its guidelines for protecting health workers to China and other countries with Covid-19 cases, but the critical problem in coronavirus-hit Chinese hospitals appears to be obtaining protective gear.\nOn Friday, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said that it would send 3.5 tonnes of medical protective equipment to Wuhan Jinyintan hospital— one of the hospitals at the forefront of treating patients with the virus.\nThe lockdown in China’s cities is intended to stop the virus travelling but has impeded the production and delivery of essential supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks and glove, while donations have not always got through to where they are most needed.\nWHO is already seeking more information from the Chinese government about the change in the way doctors are now diagnosing Covid-19, which led to a big surge in diagnoses numbers on Thursday. An extra 15,000 cases were reported from the centre of the outbreak, Hubei province, who had all been diagnosed by a CT scan of their lungs and not a lab test.\nOn Saturday the National Health Commission announced the total number of cases in China stood at 66,492. Deaths from the virus stood at 1,523. The total cases included lab-confirmed Covid-19 and clinically diagnosed cases by doctors. Tedros said they needed to know doctors were not misdiagnosing other infections as the coronavirus.\n“While it is not uncommon in outbreaks for clinical definitions to change over time as more information becomes available, we are seeking further clarification on how the clinical diagnosis is being made, to ensure that other respiratory illnesses including influenza are not getting mixed into the Covid-19 data,” he said.\nUS experts will be part of an international team that will arrive in China at the weekend to hold talks with their counterparts, the WHO said. The confirmation followed calls from a senior White House official for Beijing to be more transparent over its handling of the outbreak and its change in the reported data, as Chinese authorities expanded “wartime” measures to limit its spread.\n“We’re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese,” said Larry Kudlow, the director of the US National Economic Council.\nChina’s national health commission’s vice-director, Zeng Yixina, confirmed that more than 1,700 Chinese medical workers had been infected and six had died, adding that the commission was “highly concerned about this issue” and had issued guidelines for the prevention and control of infection within medical institutions.\nHealthcare workers accounted for about 3.8% of confirmed cases as of three days ago, Zeng said.\nThe death toll stands at 1,383. Three deaths were outside of mainland China: in Hong Kong, Japan and the Philippines.\nSingapore confirmed nine new cases on Friday, bringing its total to 67, while in Japan, the health ministry said 11 elderly passengers on the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess were allowed to leave the vessel after they tested negative.\nWhile public health experts have greeted the change in reporting positively, others say it raises more questions about the data. The change in diagnostic criteria has been applied only to Hubei province.\n“Is the politburo really being honest with us?” Kudlow asked, referring to communist China’s top leadership body. Kudlow said President Xi Jinping had assured Donald Trump that Beijing would accept US help, but “they won’t let us”.\n“I don’t know what their motives are. I do know that apparently more and more people are suffering over there,” he said.\nAt a meeting of senior leaders in Beijing on Thursday, officials called for other areas to “adopt quarantine and rescue measures equal to that of Wuhan”, which has been under lockdown for the past three weeks. The meeting, chaired by the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, called on Wuhan to speed up classifying and quarantining residents suspected or confirmed of contracting the virus.\nIn Huanggang, one of the worst-hit areas outside of Wuhan with more than 2,000 cases and at least 59 deaths, authorities issued emergency measures for 14 days, “fully sealing” all residential areas and banning vehicles, except those for emergency, medical or official purposes.\nCheckpoints would be set up and public security deployed to enforce the measures. Local district committees are to organise residents’ food and supplies. “All residents must not enter or leave their communities without authorisation,” the notice said.\nAdditional reporting by Pei Wu Lin"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/03/12/the-politics-of-pandemics", "title": "Covid - 19 - The politics of pandemics | Leaders", "text": "TO SEE WHAT is to come look to Lombardy, the affluent Italian region at the heart of the covid-19 outbreak in Europe. Its hospitals provide world-class health care. Until last week they thought they would cope with the disease—then waves of people began turning up with pneumonia. Having run out of ventilators and oxygen, exhausted staff at some hospitals are being forced to leave untreated patients to die.\nThe pandemic, as the World Health Organisation (WHO) officially declared it this week, is spreading fast, with almost 45,000 cases and nearly 1,500 deaths in 112 countries outside China. Epidemiologists reckon Italy is one or two weeks ahead of places like Spain, France, America and Britain. Less-connected countries, such as Egypt and India, are further behind, but not much. (For more coverage of covid-19 see our coronavirus hub.)\nFew of today’s political leaders have ever faced anything like a pandemic and its economic fallout—though some are evoking the financial crisis of 2007-09 (see article). As they belatedly realise that health systems will buckle and deaths mount, leaders are at last coming to terms with the fact that they will have to weather the storm. Three factors will determine how they cope: their attitude to uncertainty; the structure and competence of their health systems; and, above all, whether they are trusted.\nThe uncertainty has many sources. One is that SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes, covid-19, are not fully understood (see article). Another is over the status of the pandemic. In each region or country it tends to proliferate rapidly undetected. By the time testing detects cases in one place it will be spreading in many others, as it was in Italy, Iran and South Korea. By the time governments shut schools and ban crowds they may be too late.\nChina’s solution, endorsed by the WHO, was to impose a brutal quarantine, bolstered by mass-testing and contact tracing. That came at a high human and economic cost, but new infections have dwindled. This week, in a victory lap, President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, where the pandemic first emerged (see article). Yet uncertainty persists even in China, because nobody knows if a second wave of infections will rise up as the quarantine eases.\nIn democracies leaders have to judge if people will tolerate China’s harsh regime of isolation and surveillance. Italy’s lockdown is largely self-policed and does not heavily infringe people’s rights. But if it proves leakier than China’s, it may be almost as expensive and a lot less effective (see article).\nEfficacy also depends on the structure and competence of health-care systems. There is immense scope for mixed messages and inconsistent instructions about testing and when to stay isolated at home. Every health system will be overwhelmed. Places where people receive very little health care, including refugee camps and slums, will be the most vulnerable. But even the best-resourced hospitals in rich countries will struggle.\nUniversal systems like Britain’s National Health Service should find it easier to mobilise resources and adapt rules and practices than fragmented, private ones that have to worry about who pays whom and who is liable for what (see article). The United States, despite its wealth and the excellence of its medical science, faces hurdles. Its private system is optimised for fee-paying treatments. America’s 28m uninsured people, 11m illegal immigrants and an unknown number without sick pay all have reasons to avoid testing or isolation. Red tape and cuts have fatally delayed adequate testing (see article).\nUncertainty will be a drag on the third factor—trust. Trust gives leaders licence to take difficult decisions about quarantines and social-distancing, including school closures. In Iran the government, which has long been unpopular, is widely suspected of covering up deaths and cases. That is one reason rebellious clerics could refuse to shut shrines, even though they spread infection (see article).\nNothing stokes rumour and fear more than the suspicion that politicians are hiding the truth. When they downplay the threat in a misguided attempt to avoid panic, they end up sowing confusion and costing lives. Yet leaders have struggled to come to terms with the pandemic and how to talk about it. President Donald Trump, in particular, has veered from unfounded optimism to attacking his foes. This week he announced a 30-day ban on most travel from Europe that will do little to slow a disease which is already circulating in America. As people witness the death of friends and relatives, he will find that the pandemic cannot be palmed off as a conspiracy by foreigners, Democrats and CNN.\nWhat should politicians do? Each country must strike its own balance between the benefits of tracking the disease and the invasion of privacy, but South Korea and China show the power of big data and mass-testing as a way of identifying cases and limiting their spread. Governments also need to anticipate the pandemic, because actions to slow its spread, such as banning crowds, are more effective if they are early.\nThe best example of how to respond is Singapore, which has had many fewer cases than expected. Thanks to an efficient bureaucracy in a single small territory, world-class universal health care and the well-learned lesson of SARS, an epidemic of a related virus in 2003, Singapore acted early. It has been able to make difficult trade-offs with public consent because its message has been consistent, science-based and trusted.\nIn the West covid-19 is a challenge to the generation of politicians who have taken power since the financial crisis. Many of them decry globalisation and experts. They thrive on division and conflict. In some ways the pandemic will play to their agenda. Countries may follow America and turn inward and close their borders. In so far as shortages crimp the world economy, industries may pull back from globalisation—though they would gain more protection by diversifying their supply chains.\nYet the pandemic also puts doctors, scientists and policy experts once again at the heart of government. Pandemics are quintessentially global affairs. Countries need to work together on treatment protocols, therapeutics and, it is hoped, a vaccine. Worried voters may well have less of an appetite for the theatrical wrestling match of partisan politics. They need their governments to deal with the real problems they are facing—which is what politics should have been about all along. ■\nDig deeper:\n- For more coverage of covid-19 see our coronavirus hub\n- The science of the virus\n- Fatality rates for covid-19 could vary enormously\n- How to deal with a new sort of financial shock\n- Should other countries copy Italy’s nationwide lockdown?\nThis article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline \"The politics of pandemics\""}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/trump-navy-captain-coronavirus-0fed0560-749b-4900-bc5f-b104ed0af667.html", "title": "Trump blasts U .

But we can still fight off the virus and keep our green habits.\nThe global coronavirus pandemic has thrown our daily routine into disarray. Billions are housebound, social contact is off-limits and an invisible virus makes up look at the outside world with suspicion. No surprise, then, that sustainability and the climate movement aren't exactly a priority for many these days.\nRead more: Corona stimulus plans overlook 'historic' chance for climate crisis\nWe don't have to abandon our green habits during the crisis, but some might have to be adapted for the foreseeable future as we continue to learn about COVID-19 and how this new disease spreads.\nThe following, while not official medical advice, is based on the latest information from health authorities in Germany, the United States, the European Union and the World Health Organization.\nIt should be considered along with the official recommendations that have stressed the importance of maintaining distance and staying home, if possible — and, of course, proper hand-washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nAre foods wrapped in plastic safer?\nPeople tend to view packaged foods as being cleaner and safer to consume, and research firm BloombergNEF pointed out in a mid-March report that \"concerns around food hygiene due to COVID-19 could increase plastic packaging intensity.\" After all, much of the materials used in hospitals are made of single-use plastic, so shouldn't we apply the same standards to our food?\n\"Plastic does not inherently make something clean and safe,\" said Ivy Schlegel, a research specialist for Greenpeace USA, in a recent report from the environmental group. Schlegel pointed out that a number of studies, including one published March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that \"the virus will persist on plastic longer than almost any material examined [up to three days in laboratory conditions — editor's note], which could call into question the safety of the majority of plastic-packaged items in supermarkets.\"\nFood wrapped in plastic isn't necessarily safer\nReusable bags aren't thought to spread COVID-19 — but wash them just in case\nWhile stores are wiping down and disinfecting surfaces like door handles, shopping carts and checkout card terminals, it's highly unlikely that employees have time to clean every package of pasta or can of beans. Bottled water isn't necessary, either: the European Food Information Council has pointed out that although the \"virus can remain active in water for a short period of time,\" tap water is filtered and disinfected before it reaches the home, \"which would inactivate the COVID-19 virus.\"\nThat means we can still choose glass or cardboard packaging over plastic. Purchased products can also be left in a separate box in an out-of-the-way place for three days, to allow any traces of the virus to die off. Fresh produce that will be eaten raw can be scrubbed with a vegetable brush and plenty of water; according to Mike Kortsch at Germany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), that's enough to ensure it's safe to eat, even unpeeled.\nDo reusable bags and containers spread the virus?\nAmid the outbreak, many businesses have temporarily banned the use of reusable containers and other items — most notably Starbucks, where, until recently, customers with a reusable cup could enjoy a discounted coffee. Some grocery stores have also sidelined reusable cloth bags and containers, over fears these items could spread the virus to other customers and store employees. Some communities are even reversing existing plastic bag bans or postponing their start.\nWhat are the eco-friendly options? Where cloth bags are still allowed, it's probably fine to keep using them. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says, based on current research, that it \"may be possible\" to be infected with COVID-19 from a surface or object with the virus on it, but \"this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\"\nThat appears to be especially true for porous or fibrous surfaces, like cardboard or cloth. But to err on the side of caution, bags should be washed after every use and kept in a separate place at home once groceries have been unloaded.\nIf forced to choose between paper or plastic, try to go for bags made from recycled materials. Both kinds have their disadvantages — plastic is most often made from fossil fuels or biofuels, while the production of paper bags uses up lots of water and virgin wood — but at least the paper versions will biodegrade.\nShould we avoid grocery stores? Is takeout food safe to eat?\nWith restaurants closed and so many people stuck at home, the takeout business is booming. It's still a reliable option — the European Food Safety Authority has said there is \"currently no evidence that food is a likely source or route of transmission\" of COVID-19. Heat from cooking kills off the virus, deliveries can be paid for in advance and dropped off at the door, and the risk from packaging is low.\nBut what about all those plastic containers and pizza boxes? They add up, even if they're made from recycled material. Another way to avoid the problem of packaging and plastic bags — and the anxiety that comes with shopping during the COVID-19 outbreak — is to stay away from grocery stores altogether.\nIn some areas, for example, local organic farmers and food cooperatives are still delivering.\nVegetarian meals will also reduce the number of trips to the supermarket to buy fresh meat, for those without a freezer, and are better for the climate. Vegetarian and vegan diets generally have a lower carbon footprint than those that favor meat.\nAnother way to reduce our reliance on the grocery store is to grow food at home. Certain vegetables and sprouts — herbs, radishes, lettuce and microgreens, for example — can be grown quickly and easily in a small garden or on a balcony or window ledge. Compost scraps from veggies like carrots and leeks, among others, can also be used to regrow sprouts.\nDoes laundry need to be treated differently and disinfected?\nKeeping things clean is an important way to stop the spread of the virus; the CDC has recommended that we wash clothing \"using the warmest appropriate water setting … and dry items completely.\" But the additional use of very hot water and electric dryers will increase energy consumption.\n\"In normal everyday life, people in private households can wash their laundry as usual,\" said Germany's BfR. And we don't have to resort to harsh, polluting chemicals, since all soaps and detergents can help eliminate the virus. BfR does, however, advise that we treat clothing and other textiles from sick people differently, washing these items \"at a temperature of at least 60° Celsius [140 Fahrenheit] with a heavy-duty detergent\" and not shaking them out.\nWe can continue to hang clothes to air dry on a sunny day. Though sunlight can be used to kill off pathogens, according to the WHO, it hasn't been proven effective against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But the virus will find it harder to survive on dry surfaces.\nTo cut back on laundry, consider keeping a set of clothes to wear outside the house for trips to the grocery store or pharmacy. Once back at home, they should be removed immediately and stored in a closed bag, to give the virus time to die off. And if using a public laundromat, remember to disinfect laundry baskets and washing machines.\nEvery day, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

But structural weaknesses endemic to America’s long-term-care system—underinvestment, understaffing, and the use of low-wage employees—have made a dangerous situation much more deadly, health-policy experts say. So has the government’s response to the virus: The initial epicenter of the pandemic in the United States was a nursing home outside Seattle, where at least 40 residents have died of COVID-19. Yet following that outbreak, health officials did not prioritize the residents and staff of such facilities in the rest of the country to receive lifesaving testing and equipment.\nWajahat Ali: This is what happens when the federal government abandons you\n“Nursing-home residents aren’t getting half of our resources or half of our attention, yet they account for roughly half the deaths,” David Grabowski, a health-care-policy professor at Harvard Medical School, told me. This, he said, reveals—or maybe reinforces—a devastating truism about American society: “We don’t value their lives as much as other people’s.”\nJim Wright, the medical director of a publicly funded nursing home in Virginia, was more blunt. “We’re literally killing elders now, through our lack of funding,” he told me. “It’s not metaphorical.”\nW\nright’s facility, Canterbury Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center in Richmond, had its first suspected case of the coronavirus on March 11, well before states and cities nationwide shut down. The sick resident, a man living on a floor with 50 other people, was immediately quarantined in a special wing of the facility. In the days that followed, 131 other residents would test positive for COVID-19.\n“They were just dropping so fast; we felt helpless,” Nina Gwathney, a licensed practical nurse who has worked at Canterbury since 1982, told me. Overwhelmed employees soon began to quit in droves, causing a critical staffing shortage, and Gwathney spent her days running back and forth between rooms—taking temperatures, passing out Tylenol, fielding phone calls from worried family members. “We were getting overworked,” she said. “We were walking around the building just literally crying.”\nBy the first week of April, Canterbury was able to beef up staffing by recruiting through an outside agency. But the damage had already been done: More than a dozen residents in Gwathney’s unit were dead. From March 11 until the outbreak calmed down earlier this month, Canterbury lost 49 residents to the virus—a 37 percent mortality rate.\nAdequate funding really matters in this crisis: It can’t prevent the virus from entering a facility, but it can determine the staff’s ability to respond, Wright told me. “If you’re looking for the perfect scenario for a virus to pass quickly through a population and kill a lot of them, look no further than a publicly funded nursing home.” Most of Canterbury’s residents, as is the case in many nursing homes, pay through Medicaid, which provides the facilities with limited reimbursement. That underfunding means that many residents live in cramped quarters, forced to share bedrooms and bathrooms, which can make limiting the spread of infection difficult. (In October, the Richmond facility was cited for violating infection-control protocols. The center came under new ownership earlier this year, and a survey conducted in February, before the COVID-19 outbreak hit, reportedly found no deficiencies.)"}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/27/russian-doctor-in-critical-condition-after-falling-from-hospital-for-coronavirus-patients-a70109", "title": "Russian Doctor in Critical Condition After Falling From Hospital for Coronavirus Patients", "text": "The head of a Siberian hospital repurposed for coronavirus patients is in critical condition after she fell from the hospital building following a conference call with health officials, local media reported Saturday.\nYelena Nepomnyashchaya, 47, fell from a fifth-floor window of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Hospital for War Veterans after talks with the head of the Krasnoyarsk region’s health department, according to the TVK broadcaster.\nYet another mysterious fall in Russia.

If all goes well, stores and museums will open May 18, and restaurants, cafes and salons on June 1, he said.\nBut he warned that if people don't wear masks and obey other social-distancing rules, “the curve of contagion can rise again, it will go out of control, deaths will climb and we’ll have irreparable damage” to the economy. After Italian bishops complained that these latest rules didn't allow for public Masses, Conte's office said a plan for such worship would be released.\nIn Spain, where the crisis is also easing, the streets echoed again with children’s shrieks of joy and the clatter of bicycles after youngsters under 14 were allowed out of their homes with one parent for up to an hour of play.\n“This is wonderful!

At Christ the King Lutheran Church in Billings, every other pew was kept empty. Roughly 100 people streamed into St. Anthony Catholic Church in Laurel, where ushers tried to keep families separate from one another and hand sanitizer was available.\n“It’s like being given life again,” said church member Jack Auzqui.

Health authorities investigated and found no hard evidence for the claims, and sought to reassure locals that the risk of further infections was “very low”.\nSelf-isolation does not mean staying indoors\nMedical chief of Helsinki health centres Timo Lukkarinen told Ilta Sanomat that those quarantined are in fact still able to go outside.\n“Walking the dog is allowed, for example,” Lukkarinen said, “but you must not go near anybody and have to maintain a distance of two metres from other people. Going inside anywhere is also off-limits, which naturally means you cannot go to a shop even if you were to stay away from everybody.”\nStiff punishments for rule-breakers\nUnder Finland’s public health laws, an infection specialist at a municipality or hospital district can order a person to be quarantined, either at home or at a hospital, if they contract or are suspected of contracting an infection that could justifiably be considered a danger to public health.\n“If a person does not follow the decision and leaves the quarantine, they could be convicted of a health protection violation under Finland’s criminal code, and given a fine or sentenced to up to three months’ imprisonment,” Liisa Katajamäki from Finland’s Social Affairs and Health Ministry told Finnish media last week.\nQuarantined kids’ parents still allowed to work\nA question often posed to Finnish health authorities is why the family members of the quarantined schoolchildren were not also ordered to isolate themselves, but instead could continue going to work.\nUnlike the children themselves, the parents had not been in direct contact with an infected person, and therefore are not deemed a risk.\n“A person in quarantine but showing no symptoms is not infectious,” Finland’s national institute of health and welfare (THL) says on its website.\n“Once somebody becomes infected, there is a delay before they can infect anybody else,” THL says. “Therefore there is no reason to impose restrictions on the close circle of an exposed but symptomless person.”\nSimilarly, people with no symptoms are not tested for the virus. If a person begins showing symptoms, they will be tested and, “if necessary, quarantine restrictions imposed on their close circle,” THL says.\nHowever, as this is a new virus it is not yet known for sure whether it can be spread by asymptomatic people. The US Centers for Disease Control acknowledges that this \"might be possible\" but says that asymptomatic transmission is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\nOfficials have also been taking steps to ensure that samples for coronavirus tests can be taken as quickly as possible, in a matter of minutes.\nFor example, a family can drive into the ambulance bay at Helsinki’s new Children’s Hospital and have samples taken without even getting out of the car.\nNew hotline launched\nLast week health officials launched a hotline for people seeking information about the virus. Members of the public can call 0295 535 535 between 08.00 and 21.00 on a weekday and 09.00 and 15.00 on Saturdays.\nHowever the number does not offer medical advice, for which people should contact their local health centre or out-of-hours number if they believe they may be infected with the virus, officials say.\nEDIT 18.15 7 March: Added reference to US CDC comments on asymptomatic transmission."}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/coronavirus_spreads_to_old-age_homes_three_residents_die_in_north_savo/11292604", "title": "Coronavirus spreads to old - age homes , three residents die in North Savo", "text": "Coronavirus spreads to old-age homes, three residents die in North Savo\nThree major care-centre operators have confirmed cases, but have not announced exact numbers or locations.\nThree very elderly people have died of Covid-19 complications at a care facility in Upper Savo.

In addition, the association wants, similarily to police and medical workers, security personnel to be able to protect themselves from the virus and get tested easily.\n\"While two weeks ago, it was possible to purchase the protective masks for €4 per box, in the meantime, all the masks have run out, and now a box costs €40. Furthermore, they are promising that the box will cost even more,\" Head of the Association of Security Companies Andre Lilleleht said in a letter he wrote to the Minister of the Interior Mart Helme.\nAccording to Lilleleht, security employees also need protective equipment to avoid getting infected with the virus, and they are waiting for help from the state to provide them with protective masks, rubber gloves and disinfectants.\n\"Security companies have spent tens of thousands of euros on purchasing protective equipment (costing between €10,000 and €13,000 for larger companies).

Therefore, rapid needs-based testing of security staff must happen to give frontline employees certainty as to whether or not they are carrying the virus.\"\nLilleleht notes that security guards who provide day-to-day security are at the frontline of the crisis, just as police and medical personnel are.\n\"Their work at government building gates, at vital service providers, state and local government agencies, businesses, in ensuring the cash flow, protecting people, order and property are essential to keeping our society safe,\" he says.\n--\nDownload the ERR News app for Android and iOS now and never miss an update!\nEditor: Roberta Vaino"}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/how-coronavirus-works-cough-and-fever-can-become-catastrophic-organ-shutdown-mzwhnv6ml", "title": "How coronavirus works : cough and fever can become catastrophic organ shutdown", "text": "How coronavirus works: cough and fever can become catastrophic organ shutdown\nCovid-19 belongs to a family of pathogens known as coronaviruses, which get their name from their appearance: “corona” means “crown” in Latin. They look like spheres fringed by spikes known as “glycoproteins” — these are the tools the virus uses to infiltrate cells in the human body.\nA spike fits, like a key in a lock, with another protein known as ACE2, which is found on the surface of cells in the respiratory tract. This allows the virus to break into the cells of the lungs and, once inside, hijack their machinery to reproduce. This in turn triggers an immune response — the body begins sending chemical alarm calls to biological sentry systems including white blood cells, which rush to sites of infection.\nThe symptoms"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/china/2020/02/29/to-curb-covid-19-china-is-using-its-high-tech-surveillance-tools", "title": "Code red - To curb covid - 19 , China is using its high - tech surveillance tools | China", "text": "WHEN THE covid-19 virus started spreading in China, and the government began locking down the country, Shen Dacheng’s friends called her a prophet. Her short story “Miss Box Man”, published in 2018, is set in a world of virus-induced fear. The rich live in sealed containers which protect them from the pathogen. For the rest, life is a constant series of compulsory blood tests and hosings-down with disinfectant. Those found with the virus are seized. Some are killed on the spot. Sensors are hidden everywhere, looking out for carriers.\nChina’s non-fictional epidemic has echoes of that dystopia, minus the caskets and the killings. Take Ms Sun, who lives with her son and husband in the eastern city of Hangzhou. The city’s health-check app flagged her as a possible carrier of the virus after she reported a runny nose through its self-assessment form. She had just returned from her native province in the north-west, where she had met people from Hubei, the province at the centre of the outbreak that has infected more than 65,000 people in China and killed about 2,600 others since December.\nThe red colour of the QR code on Ms Sun’s “Hangzhou Health Code” app indicated that she was supposed to be undergoing 14 days of self-quarantine. Had the code been yellow, it would have meant she was a lower risk and had to isolate herself for seven days. For free passage around the city, people must produce their phones at checkpoints and show they have a green QR code. Pictured is another method of keeping tabs on people: drivers have to scan the code held up by a drone to register for entry into the city, in this case Shenzhen.\nMs Sun’s app did not offer her a chance to explain that she has chronic rhinitis, a common nasal condition. Only after an appeal to the local government and a visit from neighbourhood officials was her red status changed to green, allowing her to move around Hangzhou again.\nMuch of China’s success so far in containing the virus’s spread outside Hubei has depended on mobilising legions of people to man checkpoints armed with clipboards and thermometer guns, or to go door-to-door making note of sniffles. But as the daily number of newly confirmed cases of covid-19 continues to fall in China, and the government struggles to get the economy going again after more than a month of paralysis, officials will rely more heavily on surveillance technology to prevent a resurgence of the virus. It will enable them to adopt a more tailored approach, allowing most people to resume their normal lives while monitoring those who might be infected.\nSmartphones, which are carried by most working-age Chinese, will be powerful tools. They are already used extensively by police to track people’s movements and monitor their online behaviour. Covid-19 offers the government an incentive and an excuse to exploit their capabilities more fully, this time in pursuit of data that could help the clipboard-carriers identify their targets. As other countries worry about a possible pandemic of covid-19, they will watch China to see whether its digital snooping can provide lessons in how to control the virus’s spread.\nIt is often assumed that the surveillance systems used by China’s security services are highly integrated and offer an abundance of up-to-the-minute intelligence on almost every citizen. In the far-western province of Xinjiang, there may be some truth in this. Data culled from smartphones and ubiquitous facial-recognition cameras are used to identify people there whom the authorities regard as threatening: devout Muslims or those with a fondness for Xinjiang’s non-Han cultures. Such information has helped the government round up more than 1m people and put them in “re-education centres”.\nBut those efforts involve only a single province. Creating such systems is far harder when it entails data-sharing between provinces, or between provincial and central authorities. Co-operation is undermined by competition for favour in Beijing. The boss of a foreign artificial-intelligence developer in China says that fusing datasets within a single firm is often quick, but not if it involves co-operation between different institutions. “The person in charge is unwilling to take the risk,” he says, and usually reckons that doing nothing is safer than sharing.\nEven with the best of technology and the most joined-up of bureaucracies, tracking covid-19 would be difficult. Other diseases that have caused global alarm this century, such as Ebola and SARS, have been easier to monitor because those infected have quickly shown symptoms, unlike those with the covid-19 virus.\nA “close-contact” app being developed with much fanfare by a state-owned firm, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, therefore should be viewed with scepticism. (The company is also responsible for much of the surveillance technology deployed in Xinjiang.) The app is supposed to provide officials with data drawn from the National Health Commission, the Ministry of Transport, China Railway and the Civil Aviation Administration of China to track citizens’ travel, health and contacts with infected people. But it is not clear how work on this is proceeding, if it is at all.\nFor now, China’s digital monitoring methods for covid-19 are a hodgepodge of disjointed efforts by city and provincial governments, as well as the technology giants Alibaba and Tencent. Witness the self-assessment system that ensnared Ms Sun. It is being rolled out by Ant Financial, an Alibaba affiliate that runs Alipay, a ubiquitous payment app. Two hundred cities are now using it, says Alibaba, after its trial in Hangzhou. Ant Financial eventually plans to offer it nationwide.\nA representative of Ant Financial says the app, which is bundled with Alipay, is merely a conduit for data compiled by the government. Tencent’s WeChat, a social-media platform, offers a similar app using data from the same source. It has been introduced in Tencent’s home town, Shenzhen. Such non-state firms may be best-equipped to harness data to good effect in the battle against the virus. Unlike government bodies, they have a cohesive nation-wide view of their customers and ready access to intimate details about them.\nBoth Alipay and WeChat harvest their users’ location data. Through WeChat, Tencent knows who its users talk to. WeChat Pay and Alipay know who receives their users’ money. Both Tencent and Ant Financial know what travel tickets their users have bought through the companies’ respective apps. They have better real-time awareness of what Chinese people are doing and discussing than the government itself.\nPeople in China, as well as in democracies, worry about how tech companies use the data they garner from their customers. But if covid-19 becomes a pandemic, they may well become more inclined to forgive a more nosy use of personal data if doing so helps defeat the virus. ■\nRead more:\nCovid-19 is now in 50 countries, and things will get worse (February 27th)\nMarkets wake up with a jolt to the implications of covid-19 (February 27th)\nCovid-19 presents economic policymakers with a new sort of threat (February 20th)\nHow China’s coronavirus epidemic could hurt the world economy (February 13th)\nThis article appeared in the China section of the print edition under the headline \"Code red\""}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/25/covid-19-spanish-hotel-on-lockdown-as-virus-confirmed", "title": "COVID - 19 : Spanish hotel on lockdown as virus confirmed", "text": "A hotel on the holiday island of Tenerife was on lockdown on Tuesday after a guest tested positive for COVID-19, the new virus from China that has infected thousands worldwide.\nHundreds of guests at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel are now being monitored, a health authority spokeswoman told AFP.\nOfficials claimed the hotel was not under quarantine.

Then he shows us rows of black body bags lined up unceremoniously on the floor and waiting to be prepared for burial.\nAfter this, he takes his camera phone into another room and then another. The same grim situation - body after body, laid out on the ground in some kind of macabre queue.\nThe video was filmed in the main cemetery in Qom, a holy city in central Iran. It was where coronavirus first began spreading in the country.\nIn the footage, the mortuary worker says all the bodies are of victims of coronavirus, though the BBC cannot verify his claims.\nBut it's what he says next that captured the internet's attention. In a passing comment, he explains that some of the corpses had been in the morgue for five or six days.\nThe footage, and his comments, hinted at a wider truth: Iran was struggling to cope with the sheer number of people that had died, which could be far higher than it has acknowledged.\nSince the video surfaced on 2 March and promptly went viral, the response of Iranian authorities to the film has given a glimpse into how the country is fighting to control the narrative around coronavirus.\nThe context to the video\nNo other country in the Middle East has been hit as hard by Covid-19 as Iran.\nIt's notoriously difficult to get accurate information out of the country, but many online posts suggest the country's mortuaries are indeed overwhelmed.\nThis is partly because many of the professional body washers have reportedly refused to cleanse Covid-19 victims over fears they could catch the virus from the corpses.\nInstead, at some mortuaries, this task of washing the dead in line with Islamic tradition falls to volunteers - usually seminary students.\nWhile it's not thought that coronavirus can be contracted from the dead, the World Health Organization advises people to take an \"abundance of caution\", because so much is unknown about the virus\nIn Italy, for example, health authorities say that although the virus cannot be transmitted posthumously, it can still survive on clothes - so corpses there are being sealed away immediately and it's forbidden for families to visit the bodies of their loved ones.\nHow Iranian authorities reacted\nAfter the mortuary footage went viral, hardliners were quick to react. The man who filmed it was arrested, and then authorities turned their attention to reassuring the public all bodies were being treated with respect and in keeping with Islam.\nAccording to Sharia law, loved ones must be buried soon after passing away. Before that though the corpse must be cleansed with water three times, a process called Ghosl-e Meyyet.\nAnd at the beginning of March, Iran's Supreme Leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, declared that the bodies of Covid-19 victims must be treated exactly like anyone else; cleansed, wrapped in burial shrouds and the regular prayer for the dead must be performed for them.\nTo quell anger that the viral footage provoked, hardline websites began focusing on one group of morgue volunteers in particular.\nKnown as the Corona Ladies, they are a group of female volunteers, also in Qom. Coverage portrayed them as brave women committed to giving the dead the Islamic last rite, despite the possible risks to their health.\nThey are made up of three teams each working seven-hour shifts to keep up with the demand, and repeat religious invocations and chants to help them through their work. They say that when they wash the corpses of young people, they cry these out louder to help steel themselves for the task ahead.\nA slogan written on their backs reads: \"If you don't have the courage of a lion, you cannot undertake the journey of love.\"\nWith hospitals overrun and mortuaries reportedly struggling to cope, the government is facing uncomfortable questions about whether that crisis is worse than it has made out.\nHow bad is coronavirus in Iran?\nAccording to official government statistics, more than 60,000 people in Iran have contracted the virus and about 4,000 have died. But a group of Iranian researchers in the US believes the real figures to be much, much higher.\nRather than relying just on Iranian government statistics, the researchers, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Virginia Tech, developed a model that simulates the spread of the disease. It uses data on infected Iranian travellers who tested positive at the point of entry to other countries, as well as numerous medical community estimates, to calculate what they say is a more accurate figure.\nThey estimated that, as of 20 March, more than 15,000 people had lost their lives and the number of infections could actually have been closer to one million. That is 10 times the official figures, which by that day was 1,433 deaths and just under 20,000 confirmed cases.\nWe may never know the true extent of the crisis in Iran, but the signs of its scale are being dug into the earth.\nIn some cases, the bodies of multiple victims are, instead of being put in individual graves, being placed side by side in long trench-like burial sites - unheard of in this part of the world.\nA doctor from the Mazandaran region of northern Iran, who didn't want to be identified, told the BBC that public safety experts had been dispatched to monitor the process of enshrouding, burying and covering the graves with lime, which officials say is used to help disinfect bodies and prevent the spread of the virus.\nThe doctor said that despite victims' death certificates stating cardiac arrest or the flu as the cause of death, the fact these experts had been dispatched indicated that the cause of death was in fact Covid-19.\nMeanwhile, a number of families say they have no information about the whereabouts of their loved ones' bodies. They have been told this will be communicated to them once the crisis is over so they can go to visit the graves of those they have lost.\nBut in the meantime, religious figures are trying to reassure relatives that their loved ones are being treated with respect and are being buried in line with all the correct Islamic rites."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-chinese-mystery-and-covid-19s-economic-puzzle-11583521819", "title": "A Chinese Mystery and Covid - 19 Economic Puzzle", "text": "- Opinion\n- Business World\nA Chinese Mystery and Covid-19’s Economic Puzzle\nHas Beijing ‘contained’ the virus?

The tests came back positive last night. I isolated myself. Just a few moments ago, I was told that the final test came. I’ll start taking medicine. Generally, I feel fine. I just felt a bit tired, I had a fever, and it will drop.\n“Be sure with the effort of the medical staff and ministry of health headed by the [health minister] and with your support and the state and military within the coming weeks, we’ll be victorious against this virus.\n“We’ll defeat corona. Be assured. I’m saying this deep from my heart. This virus is democratic, and it doesn’t distinguish between poor and rich or statesman and an ordinary citizen.\n“Many might get infected, but we have enough effective medicine, take care of yourselves. Take care of the nurses and doctors who work heroically.”\nIran has become the regional focal point of fears surrounding coronavirus. Neighbouring states have largely shut their borders and suspended pilgrimage routes. Schools and universities in many parts of the country have been closed. Four new cases were suspected to have been diagnosed in the Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Tuesday. If confirmed, it would take the national tally to five cases, a number that is widely expected to rise, possibly substantially, in the coming days. Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman also reported their first new coronavirus cases, all in people who had been to Iran.\nMeanwhile, Turkey diverted a plane from Tehran, which had been destined for Istanbul, to its capital Ankara, after 17 passengers were reported to have higher than average temperatures.\nAdditional reporting: Mohammed Rasool"}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/coronavirus_latest_nearly_3000_cases_in_finland_passenger_shipping_traffic_suspended/11249610", "title": "Coronavirus latest : 64 fatalities , THL chief recommends fabric masks for  everyone , police to probe PPE deal", "text": "An eatery at Espoo's Iso Omena shopping mall stands empty, but restaurants will be able to open their doors again on 1 June.

In many an economic downturn that is true—an anxiety-induced reluctance to spend is the main threat to prosperity. For now, the world is treating the outbreak of covid-19, a disease caused by a coronavirus that is now responsible for more than 2,000 deaths, as no exception. Central banks across Asia are easing monetary policy while governments prepare spending programmes to limit the economic damage.\nCovid-19, however, is not a conventional economic threat. Efforts to contain the virus are limiting activity by shutting factories and disrupting supply-chains. Such shocks to supply are harder to manage than anxiety-induced frugality among firms and investors. When people stop spending, growth slows and inflation falls. But when supply is constrained, prices can accelerate even as the economy wobbles. Economists first grappled with supply shocks in the 1970s, when reductions in food and oil supplies ended three decades of unprecedented growth and ushered in “stagflation”. Supply shocks divided the profession. Predictably, there was a row over whether governments should prioritise fighting rising unemployment or high inflation. In a victory that would shape central banking for decades, the inflation hawks eventually won.\nLike the oil and food shocks of the 1970s, the covid-19 epidemic poses an unexpected threat to a mainstay of global production. For as long as the mobility of Chinese workers is limited, shops, offices and factories in the world’s largest exporter will sit idle. As a result, firms dependent on supplies from China are running down inventories and curtailing operations. On February 17th Apple warned investors that supply-chain problems were limiting iPhone production and would reduce its revenues (see article). Hyundai, a carmaker, has cut production in South Korea because of parts shortages. On February 18th Jaguar Land Rover, a British carmaker, said that it could start to run out of parts in two weeks’ time, and that it had flown in emergency supplies from China in suitcases.\nBut whether the understanding of supply shocks forged in the 1970s still applies is unclear. In practice, the distinction between shocks to demand and those to supply is fuzzy. In a paper published in 2013 that revisited the era of stagflation, Alan Blinder of Princeton University and Jeremy Rudd of the Federal Reserve argue that supply alone cannot explain the soaring unemployment of the 1970s. In fact, they say, price increases had demand effects that mattered more. They raised uncertainty, reduced households’ disposable income and eroded the value of their savings.\nSubsequent experience supports this more nuanced view of the effect of supply shocks. Soaring oil prices in 2007 gutted household consumption in America and helped push its economy into recession. The earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster that struck Japan in 2011 dealt a blow to Japanese industry which, like China’s, occupies important supply-chain niches. The catastrophe led to a sharp decline in output and exports (and a long-term shift in economic activity away from the most affected regions), but despite the disruptions Japan remained in deflation. Higher tariffs should, in theory, disrupt supply and boost prices. But to date the main economic effect of the trade war being fought by America and China has been dented confidence, derailed business investment and tumbling interest rates. The covid-19 outbreak is hitting China’s demand for commodities and its tourists’ travel plans. Both effects drag down global demand in a conventional way, as they did after the outbreak of SARS in 2003.\nCircumstances today are also very different from the 1970s. Crucially, global inflation remains oddly subdued. That means policymakers can provide stimulus without exacerbating an ongoing inflation problem. Support seems warranted in China, where lost sales could give way to lay-offs, further cuts to spending, and a deep slump. Economies with close links to China are also moving, rightly, to shore up spending. Japan’s decision to raise consumption tax last year, a move that contributed to an annualised decline in GDP of 6.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, looks spectacularly ill-timed in hindsight.\nShould covid-19 sweep across the world, the global economy as a whole will surely need a dose of stimulus, much as China does today. The main complication then would be a lack of central-bank ammunition, as interest rates are already low. But even if the virus stays contained, governments of less affected countries could have their hands full. Policymakers facing temporary supply shocks must reassure the public that growth and inflation will eventually return to normal—as modern central banks now try to do when oil prices spike. Continued disruption, though, requires adjustment. New suppliers must be tracked down, new contracts written and new customers found. Frustrated firms could decide the time is right to wash their hands of China. The effects of such changes are hard to predict.\nIll at ease\nIf China’s economy slumps further in response, it could exert a deflationary pull on economies in the West. But if decades of economic integration, which many economists credit with holding down global inflation for the past two decades, goes into reverse, then dormant price pressures could awaken. Macroeconomic policymakers could once again be confronted with the painful decision of whether or not to fight rising inflation during an economic downturn.\nFor policymakers beset by unknowns, both overreaction and underreaction present serious risks. The time to build more resilience into production chains and financial systems has sadly passed. Perhaps the most important lesson of the 1970s is one the world ought to have appreciated before the arrival of the epidemic—shocks happen, and can transform well-worn economic terrain into something less familiar with frightening speed. ■\nRead more of our coverage of the covid-19 outbreak:\nExperts predict that covid-19 will spread more widely (February 22nd)\nIn China, newly confirmed cases of coronavirus infection are falling (February 20th)\nHow China’s coronavirus epidemic could hurt the world economy (February 13th)\nThis article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline \"Shock therapy\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/29/world/europe/29reuters-health-coronavirus-swiss-snb.html", "title": "Swiss Finance Minister Wants to Use SNB Payouts to Cut Debt : NZZ", "text": "ZURICH — Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer wants to use payouts from the Swiss National Bank exclusively to cut debt that will swell as the country ramps up borrowing to spur an economy hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, he told a newspaper.\nAfter the central bank posted an annual profit of 48.9 billion Swiss francs ($50.27 billion) for 2019, the SNB had said it would double its payout to Switzerland's regional and central governments to 4 billion francs.\nMaurer said this payout could be used to pay down the government's debts, which he thinks may push the budget into a deficit this year as the virus triggers the worst Swiss recession in 45 years.\n\"My proposal is that in future we use all the SNB's distributions to reduce our corona debt,\" he told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung.\nThe SNB declined to comment.\nThe minister predicted Switzerland, which normally runs budget surpluses, could run a budget deficit of 30 to 50 billion francs this year as unemployment rises due to the crisis.

The answer is apparently, yes,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, who was not involved in the study.\nChina has reported a total of 75,567 cases of the virus known as COVID-19 to the World Health Organization (WHO) including 2,239 deaths, and the virus has already spread to 26 countries and territories outside of mainland China.\nResearchers have reported sporadic accounts of individuals without any symptoms spreading the virus. What’s different in this study is that it offers a natural lab experiment of sorts, Schaffner said.\n“You had this patient from Wuhan where the virus is, traveling to where the virus wasn’t. She remained asymptomatic and infected a bunch of family members and you had a group of physicians who immediately seized on the moment and tested everyone.”\nAccording to the report by Dr. Meiyun Wang of the People’s Hospital of Zhengzhou University and colleagues, the woman traveled from Wuhan to Anyang on Jan. 10 and visited several relatives. When they started getting sick, doctors isolated the woman and tested her for coronavirus. Initially, the young woman tested negative for the virus, but a follow-up test was positive.\nAll five of her relatives developed COVID-19 pneumonia, but as of Feb. 11, the young woman still had not developed any symptoms, her chest CT remained normal and she had no fever, stomach or respiratory symptoms, such as cough or sore throat.\nScientists in the study said if the findings are replicated, “the prevention of COVID-19 infection could prove challenging.”\nKey questions now, Schaffner said, are how often does this kind of transmission occur and when during the asymptomatic period does a person test positive for the virus.

Some will struggle more than others. Our cover leader argues that how well countries will fare depends on three factors. One is their attitude to uncertainty: China, having imposed a brutal quarantine, is already claiming victory, perhaps prematurely; democracies are watching to see whether Italy’s largely self-policed lockdown slows the disease’s advance. Second, universal health systems, such as Britain’s, should find it easier to mobilise resources than fragmented, private ones, such as America’s, that have to worry about who pays what. Third is trust: Iran’s government is widely suspected of covering up deaths and cases. We also examine the anatomy of the virus that causes covid-19 and how it hijacks the cells of those infected. And on our Graphic Detail page we track, using mobile-phone data, how foot traffic has fallen in affected cities.

The latest turmoil started with oil, after Russia balked at Saudi Arabia’s proposal for production cuts—and the Saudis responded by starting a price war. Other oil producers can expect economic pain. Stockmarkets are down by a fifth from their peak. But the severity of the shock does not so far compare with that of 2007-09. Markets have not fallen as far; the banking system has not yet seized up; and investors have not rushed to the dollar (the usual sign of millenarian panic). But watch out, nonetheless, for stresses in the euro zone and for a temporary corporate cash squeeze. We reckon, from a crude “stress test” of listed companies, that 10-15% of firms could face liquidity problems. Corporate-bond markets are not good at bridging this kind of short but precarious gap.\nIn any other week, Joe Biden’s 15-point victory over Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary in Michigan would have merited much more attention. In 2016 Mr Sanders beat Hillary Clinton there, breathing life into a flagging campaign. This time around his mauling by Mr Biden in the Wolverine State means the contest for the nomination in 2020 looks all but over. Mr Biden will probably clock up further wins next week in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. (Our guide to America’s 2020 elections can be found here.)\nBut for the world’s concern with the coronavirus, Vladimir Putin’s latest power grab would surely have taken more headlines, too. A constitutional amendment approved by the Duma on March 10th, resetting the number of terms he can serve, may allow Russia’s president to stay in office until 2036. Other amendments curb the power of parliament and the courts. The changes must be approved by the Constitutional Court (which Mr Putin controls) and the Russian people. The vote—neither an election nor a referendum, and legally questionable—will take place on April 22nd, Lenin’s birthday.\nTwo stories this week look at vibrant startup scenes in very different economies—Britain and India. Both are far behind America and China in creating unicorns (privately held startups valued at over $1bn) but ahead of France and Germany. Britain’s forte is finance: last month Revolut, an upstart bank, became Europe’s most highly valued fintech startup, with a tag of $5.5bn. Britain’s departure from the European Union casts a cloud. So does competition from big banks. And Britain is yet to produce a giant; America and China have several. India has spawned 80,000 startups, which between them raised $10bn last year, up from $3.1bn in 2012. But their success is hard to gauge: information on realised returns is scant, and valuations are increasingly viewed with suspicion.\nThe world’s tallest mountain is crowded. Climbers must queue to reach the summit. This week the Nepalese government postponed the introduction of new rules it had proposed to thin out the mob on its side of Mount Everest.

Applicants for Everest permits should, for instance, have had to have climbed another Nepalese peak of at least 6,500 metres; Everest measures 8,848 metres. The authorities are presumably keen to ensure that stricter rules do not shrink revenues. An entire industry in one of Asia’s poorest countries depends on the mountain.

It is also advisable to avoid direct contact with people who are sick.\nKeep your hands clean!\nFrequently washing your hands with soap and water can help prevent an infection. You can also use an alcohol-based sanitizing gel instead. If you have to cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow. If you have contracted the disease without knowing it, coughing or sneezing in this manner might help to reduce the spread.\nRinse your nose with saline? Reject all packages delivered from China?

It is about minimising it.\n“We are working on the assessment that 80% of us, if we haven’t already, will get the virus.” He added: “We cannot hide away from it forever.”\nThis mirrored earlier government briefings, but the position was overtaken when computer modelling suggested a lockdown would be needed to reduce infections.\nMyrtle Lloyd, chief operating officer at the Passport Office, was also on the call. She reportedly told staff the guidance did not mean they “should stay at home instead of delivering critical services”.\n“What is also critical for us as a business is to have a manageable level of work in the system, so that when we start our recovery we are not overwhelmed by our demands,” she reportedly said.\nDowning Street backed up the Home Office’s decision that the Passport Office was “adhering to public health advice” but appeared to contradict the view of the department’s deputy chief scientific adviser that people should not seek to hide away from the virus.\nThe prime minister’s official spokesman said: “The government’s focus is on stopping the spread of the disease to protect the health service. I think you’ve heard on a daily basis from the chief scientific and medical officers they have been very, very clear on the need for people to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”\nHe gave no view on whether the government agrees that 80% of the public will eventually contract coronavirus.\nThe Public and Commercial Services union raised concerns about the reports, and said it had been pressing managers across the civil service to close offices so people could work from home.\nIts general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “It is absolutely scandalous that Her Majesty’s Passport Office are suggesting our members can go back into work during a pandemic to process routine passports.\n“The cavalier approach to our members’ health and safety is shameful and ultimately puts them in greater danger of contracting Covid-19. We have already had members die as a result of contracting coronavirus, and pressured civil service managers in other departments to shut offices so staff can work from home.\n“For the deputy chief scientific adviser at the Home Office to suggest that going into work does not put you at greater risk of contracting corona is extremely irresponsible and totally contradicts current government guidance. Processing passports is not critical work while we are in lockdown and international travel is practically non-existent due to the corona pandemic.”\nA Home Office spokesman said: “Her Majesty’s Passport Office is fully adhering to public health advice across all our offices and adopting social distancing measures to keep both its staff and customers safe.\n“It continues to operate at substantially restricted staffing levels with a significant number of people working from home where possible, and staff are prioritising emergency cases. Guidance is also available for people who are travelling into work.\n“It was made clear in the meeting that the government’s priority is slowing the spread of coronavirus and we all have a part to play in order to protect the NHS and save lives.”\nThe Home Office added that government advice had been clear that people may travel for work purposes, if they could not work from home."}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/25/chinese-robot-sprays-disinfectant-to-fight-spread-of-covid-19-coronavirus", "title": "Chinese robot sprays disinfectant to fight spread of COVID - 19", "text": "This robot developed by Chinese scientists is manipulated using a remote control.\nThe tank is filled with disinfectant liquid that is then transformed into steam to spray areas that could be infected by the COVID-19 coronavirus."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/09/it-wasnt-funny-tottenhams-dele-alli-apologises-over-coronavirus-video", "title": "  It wasnt funny : Tottenham Dele Alli apologises over coronavirus video | Football", "text": "‘It wasn’t funny’: Tottenham’s Dele Alli apologises over coronavirus video\n• England midfielder appeared to mock Asian man\n• ‘I let myself down and the club’\nDele Alli has apologised for a video posted on his Snapchat account in which the Tottenham and England midfielder appeared to mock an Asian man and joke about the coronavirus outbreak.\nAlli, who has been on holiday during his club’s winter break, posted the video of him wearing a face mask in an airport departure lounge on Saturday with the message: “Corona whattt, please listen with volume.” The 23-year-old then zooms the camera towards an unsuspecting man of Asian appearance before panning to a bottle of antiseptic hand wash captioned: “This virus gunna have to be quicker than that to catch me.”\nThe video was subsequently deleted after several complaints were made, with Alli issuing a statement on Sunday evening in which he admitted he had “let myself down and the club”.\n“I’d like to apologise for the video I posted on Snapchat yesterday,” Alli said in a video released on the Chinese social media platform Weibo.\n“It wasn’t funny. I realised that immediately and took it down. I let myself down and the club. I don’t want you guys to have that impression of me.\n“It isn’t something that should be joked about.

In Sheffield, a postgraduate student was reportedly verbally and physically harassed in the street for wearing a face mask, while in Leicestershire two students – mistakenly thought to be Chinese – were pelted with eggs on the street in Market Harborough.

The quake was also bad news for the holders of $150m-worth of “catastrophe bonds”, issued only a month before by the World Bank. Buyers were offered an attractive yield in return for the risk of not getting their money back if disaster struck. Once the quake was judged sufficiently disastrous, the money was instead paid to Mexico’s government to help it rebuild.\nIf such bonds can help countries cope with earthquakes, why not also disease? A few months before Mexico’s disaster, the World Bank sold $320m-worth of pandemic bonds (and some swaps) on behalf of the poorest 77 developing countries that it serves. The advocates of such bonds point out that they provide an upfront commitment of cash, triggered automatically according to preset rules, which is more reliable than trusting to the kindness of strangers. They also reward investors with higher yields for bearing risks that are little correlated with the rest of their portfolios.\nThe initial buyers of the bank’s riskier bonds (worth $95m) were told that they faced a 28% chance of losing money to a virus of some kind and a 5.9% chance of losing money to a novel coronavirus in particular. Those odds have now jumped. But the bonds have yet to release money to governments scrambling to prevent a pandemic. Why not?\nAccording to the terms of the bond, a payout cannot be triggered until 12 weeks after an outbreak has been reported to the World Health Organisation (which would be March 23rd). The virus must have killed at least 250 people in total and 20 people in more than one country (a condition the covid-19 virus met on February 27th, when Iran reported over 20 deaths). The outbreak must still be growing when these other criteria are met. And the amount of money a country can get depends on the number of cases it has confirmed (relative to other countries claiming the money).\nCritics argue that the conditions are overly stringent, inflexible and dilatory, taking far too long to fulfil. Of course, if the criteria were less strict, investors would have demanded an even higher interest rate on the bond, and if the trigger allowed more scope for discretion, buyers would also have shied away. The charge of tardiness is, however, harder to answer. How can such bonds prevent a pandemic happening if governments must first wait for verification that it has happened?\nIf countries respond quickly to the danger, lowering the number of cases, they may qualify for less money (or none) as a result. In normal insurance markets, people who take sensible precautions pay lower premiums. But in the case of these bonds, the “premiums” are covered by wealthy donors Japan and Germany and by the World Bank's fund for the poorest countries.\nA case can still be made for such instruments. They encourage better monitoring and reporting of infections. And although the existing bonds are too slow, the same is true of more traditional sources of finance, such as the generosity of donor countries. One novelty of the covid-19 disease is how quickly it has captured everyone’s attention. The World Bank, for example, said this week it would provide up to $12bn to help its clients respond to the outbreak, providing the money as quickly as possible. It may take the bank’s pandemic bonds until March 23rd to acknowledge the disaster taking place. But at least the bank itself does not have to wait that long. ■\nCorrection (March 24th 2020): A previous version of this piece neglected to mention that the pandemic bond is partly financed by the World Bank's International Development Association, which provides aid to the world's poorest countries.\nThis article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline \"A pussyfooting cat bond\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/style/coronavirus-public-shaming.html", "title": "Ivanka Trump and George Stephanopoulos Reach the  Corona - Shaming  Phase of the Pandemic", "text": "On April 10, the television anchor George Stephanopoulos went to a pharmacy in East Hampton, N.Y., wearing a mask and gloves, nine days after his wife, the actress Ali Wentworth, revealed she had tested positive for the coronavirus.\nIn the moment, he was just a husband and a father running an errand.\nBut Ms. Wentworth had opened up about her symptoms on “Good Morning America” telling viewers that her husband was the only one in the family entering her room.\nMr. Stephanopoulos, 59, an anchor of the show, said that he was taking care to protect himself. “I’m definitely being careful in wiping down and wearing gloves,” he said. “I have not been wearing a mask.”\nMs. Wentworth ended her video by saying: “be safe, stay home.”\nSo it irked Carrie Doyle, an author who lives in New York City and East Hampton, when she saw Mr. Stephanopoulos at White’s Apothecary about a week later. The pharmacy is offering free delivery and has urged customers to take advantage of the service to protect the health of staff and customers who need to come in to talk with the pharmacist.\n“I was dismayed that he chose the option to pick up in person,” Ms. Doyle said. “I thought it wasn’t very thoughtful to be out and about, especially since the other customers in the pharmacy were elderly.”\nWhen she got home, she vented her frustration to her nearly 1,000 Facebook friends, drawing dozens of comments. A typical one: “Very arrogant!”\nThe internet has always opened its arms to people wanting to spotlight the behavior and perceived misdeeds of neighbors, celebrities and strangers.\nBut now, weeks into the pandemic’s shutdown of businesses and schools, and with state governments calling for all but essential workers to stay home, the web is especially alight with finger-pointers: people who are genuinely concerned about public health but also, perhaps, with pent-up fears, frustrations and extra time on their hands.\nCall it “corona-shaming.”\nIn an interview, Ms. Doyle said she was bothered that Mr. Stephanopoulos had been urging viewers on television to live by the rules of isolation and social distancing, but was not, in her judgment, strictly abiding by those rules himself.\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S.\n- A deep recession and ballooning unemployment in Europe darken the global economic picture.\n- President Trump pushes to reopen the economy as new reports illustrate fragmented federal response.\n- Comparing recent deaths to historical figures hints at the real toll in each U.S. state.\nShe later heard from friends that they spotted him taking a walk on a golf course without a mask, and they sent her a picture. “I have nothing against George Stephanopoulos, and I wish his wife a speedy recovery,” she said. “But I think he should stay home.”\nOn Monday, Mr. Stephanopoulos announced he had tested positive for the coronavirus.\nIn a phone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Stephanopoulos, said that he had been following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and went into the pharmacy more than 14 days after his wife first exhibited symptoms.\n“I was staying home, I was self-monitoring, I never had a temperature, and I never had any of the classic symptoms,” Mr. Stephanopoulos said. “I was wearing a mask and gloves in White’s.”\nThe next day, he said, he decided to try to get tested because he was preparing to return to work. He was able to get tested at an urgent care facility in Bridgehampton.\nThen he took a walk on the golf course. “I was carrying a mask,” Mr. Stephanopoulos said. “I was nowhere near any people.” It was later that he learned he had tested positive.\n‘Follow the Rules’\nCelebrities and public figures are the most visible targets of corona-shaming.\nJennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez were heaped with criticism after they were photographed leaving a gym in Miami a few weeks ago.\nIvanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, were denounced after The New York Times reported that they traveled from Washington to New Jersey for Passover. (Ms. Trump has posted multiple videos preaching the importance of staying home. “Let’s do everything we can to stop the spread,” she said in one on March 23.)\nAnd on Easter, Chris Cuomo, the host of the CNN show “Cuomo Prime Time” who made headlines for dispatches from his basement about his ordeal with Covid-19, had a verbal altercation in East Hampton with a biker who said Mr. Cuomo was not following quarantine rules. Mr. Cuomo was with family, on his own property.\nIn a report the bicyclist filed with the East Hampton Town Police, he stated that when he confronted Mr. Cuomo, the television anchor said that the biker hadn’t “seen the last of him and that he would beat the crap out of him.”\nA CNN spokeswoman said: “Chris has said emphatically that this has never happened.”\n“Chris was following all social distancing guidelines and wearing a mask in his own backyard with his immediate family members,” she wrote in an email. “A complete stranger approached them from their own private driveway, in order to curse at Chris in front of his wife and children.”\nBut it’s not just public figures drawing ire.\nEarlier this month, Dana Weiss, of Deerfield, Ill., started a private Facebook group that she named “That’s it. I’m coronavirus shaming.” It has more than 1,000 members and is devoted to sharing memes and photos that show people falling short of the C.D.C.’s guidance — especially the pleas to stay at least six feet away from others and wear a mask or face covering when in proximity to people in public.\nWhat gets members riled up are the posts that reveal that some people have been planning backyard gatherings, small birthday get-togethers, vacations, even weddings.\n“There are people who don’t follow the rules, but it’s not really about that. It’s about the confidence with which people are doing that, and then sharing it on social media,” said Ms. Weiss, a mother of two teenage sons.\nHer Facebook page has drawn criticism from some in her suburban Chicago community after word got out that photos were being posted of people who were unaware that their actions had been documented. Ms. Weiss said she aims to black out identifying names and faces, and stressed that her purpose is to provide a place for people to vent and maybe even laugh.\n“I don’t think you’re a bad person,” she said, “I just don’t think you should be hosting prom in your backyard right now.”\nThe idea is to criticize actions, not people, she said. “Nobody has ever changed their behavior based on what a stranger has told them to do on the internet.”\nIn relative isolation, Candace Browdy, also of Deerfield, Ill., is glad to have social media for venting. “I’m home with an 18-year-old and a dog and neither of them are that interested in hearing it from me,” she said.\nLast Sunday, Ms. Browdy took her weekly trip to the grocery store, wearing a mask and gloves, and did what she could to remain at least six feet away from other shoppers. As she tried to make it down one aisle, she stopped short of a group of three people, maskless as they talked alongside two carts.\nMs. Browdy said she waited patiently and after a few minutes, one of the men moved his cart to let her pass. But the couple with the other cart didn’t make much room for her to get by while maintaining any distance. “I moved past them and shook my head,” she said, causing the woman who had been chatting in the group to call after Ms. Browdy: “Don’t you shake your head at us.”\nNormally, Ms. Browdy said, she would have engaged further with the woman in the aisle, but she didn’t want to spend a minute longer than necessary in the store. When she got home, she shared her anger on the corona-shaming Facebook page.\n“I could shame people all day long,” she said. “There is one way to handle this, and that is to be as careful and mindful as possible to protect yourself so you can protect other people.”\nTerri Chaseley, who lives in nearby Highland Park, Ill., has found it almost therapeutic to read the corona-shaming social media posts. “It’s somewhat cathartic to be with like-minded individuals who are upset by people not following the recommendations of scientists,” she said.\nMs. Chaseley herself was hospitalized with Covid-19 in March and is now nursing her daughters, ages 10 and 13, through the virus as well. (Her experience was reported by The Chicago Tribune.)\nWhen she was released from the hospital, and was back home — still feeling terrible and in isolation — a friend sent a group text message asking if other mothers were letting their teenage children spend time with their significant others.\nHaving come across social media posts that enraged her while she was in the hospital, Ms. Chaseley felt compelled by this text to raise awareness. “I was so mad and I wrote a semi-shaming post without naming names,” she said. It has been shared by some 16,000 people.\nBut Whose Rules?\nAs stay-at-home guidance changes from state to state and country to country, corona-shaming will surely become more widespread.\nEarlier this week, the journalist Yashar Ali posted on Twitter about Aaron Schock, a former Illinois congressman who was seen in photographs on Instagram in Los Cabos. “Love that Aaron Schock has been holed up at a villa in Mexico with a bunch of guys,” he wrote.\nA picture of Mr. Schock arm in arm with five other men on the beach was posted by Mauricio Kirschner, an event producer, with the caption “BE MY QUARANTINE.” (Messages sent to Mr. Schock on Instagram were not answered.)\nReached by phone in Mexico, Mr. Kirschner said he, Mr. Schock and the other men had been living together in a private villa since the second week in March. (Residents of Mexico were not asked to stay home until March 28.)\n“I think it’s better to stay here,” Mr. Kirschner said. “The weather is amazing. Nobody is here. It’s completely empty.”\nOne of the men, who goes by PJ Druck Torres on Instagram, said in an Instagram message that the group is “following the rules” and that “haters will always look for a flaw.”\nEarlier this week, he shared a photo of himself and a woman hugging in an infinity swimming pool. “Making the best from the worst,” he captioned it. On some of his other Instagram pictures, he added the hashtag #stayathome."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/its-ruining-everyone-coronavirus-hit-south-korean-city-daegu", "title": "  It ruining everyone : eerie quiet reigns in coronavirus - hit South Korean city", "text": "'It's ruining everyone': eerie quiet reigns in coronavirus-hit South Korean city\nMore than half of the country’s 602 cases have been traced to a church in Daegu\nSunday morning found Kim Tae-woo sitting in his convenience store at the normally bustling East Daegu train station, counting the day’s customers on the fingers of one hand.\n“Things are beyond quiet here,” he said. “It feels like I’m at a meditation centre.

No one has the peace of mind to flip through them now.”\nSouth Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, placed the country on red alert on Sunday as its number of coronavirus infections tripled over the weekend to 602.\nBarring the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, South Korea now has the highest number of infections outside China.\nResidents of Daegu, the country’s fourth-largest city and the centre of its outbreak, are leaving nothing to chance.\nThe city’s streets were eerily quiet, with stores and restaurants closed and stations, markets and shopping areas devoid of the usual foot traffic. The few people who dared to venture out were masked and wearing gloves.\nMore than half of all South Korean cases so far have been linked to the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus sect, with over 100 more cases coming from a mental health ward at Daenam hopital in the nearby town of Cheongdo.\nOfficials believe cases at the hospital may be related to a funeral of the sect leader’s brother, held there at the beginning of February.\nWhile the exact source of the infections remains unclear, health officials have pointed to a 61-year-old female member of the sect who tested positive on 18 February. Local authorities are now scrambling to trace all 9,336 members of the church’s Daegu branch as well as out of town visitors who may have come into contact with the woman.\nA taxi driver, Kwang-ho Lee, wondered why the woman hadn’t done more to stop spreading the disease.\n“It’s ruining everyone here,” he said. “I’m making less than 10% of my normal income. The other drivers and I are just standing around, waiting all day. Sometimes we’re even too scared to talk to each other because we don’t know who has the virus and who might belong to that cult.”\nThere is widespread anger over the sect’s secretiveness and their apparent unwillingness to cooperate with health officials. According to the authorities, more than 600 members of the Daegu branch are not answering calls or texts and cannot be accounted for.\nA petition demanding that the government forcibly disband the Shincheonji Church of Jesus was posted on the presidential office’s website on Friday, and has so far attracted more than 300,000 signatures.\nThe public fury directed at both the sect and the authorities was echoed by a bus driver, whose vehicle carried a single passenger.\n“If I violate a traffic law, police contact me before the day is over and I get fined,” he said. “How come they can’t get hold of so many cult members? How can we say South Korea is an IT powerhouse with this going on?”\nAt Dongseung-ro, a popular meeting place for the city’s youth, things were quiet and most of the stores and cafes were closed.\nSung-jin Choi and Yoon Na, a couple in their twenties, had decided to go out, masked up and with gloves on.\n“We saw on the internet that now is the time to experience this area looking like Gotham City, so we decided to have a look,” said Choi.\nNa said that some couples were choosing not to meet up because no one is sure whether their partner belonged to the cult. “Only couples who know each other very well can be sure,” he added.\nOne of the few places in Daegu where more than 20 people had congregated on Sunday was at the city’s medical centre.\nThe hospital has become a dedicated Covid-19 treatment centre, with paramedics and nurses working in full biohazard suits and plastic face visors.\nSome 30 people were waiting to be examined in a makeshift tent set up outside the main hospital building. Despite the constant activity by staffers, things were curiously quiet, the silence broken only by the comings and goings of ambulances and the odd cough.\nOn the other side of the city, the Shincheonji Church of Jesus building was locked up and the area, as with other parts of Daegu, was deserted.\nSimon Kim, a spokesman for the church, said it was cooperating fully with authorities.\n“We’re the biggest victims of the Covid-19 epidemic,” he said, “[and we have] become a target of hatred”. He said a membership list the church had given the authorities had been leaked, provoking hate speech and members being pressured to leave their jobs.\nBack at the train station, a group of five people sat around the communal TV set in the ticket hall. All turned out to be workers rather than travellers; given the lack of customers, there was little need for them to be behind their counters.\nWhen one of them coughed, the others turned away from the screen to look at her.\n“It’s not corona,” she said, with a wave of her hand. “My tea went down the wrong way.” No one looked relieved."}, {"url": "https://news.err.ee/1085441/one-coronavirus-ward-closes-at-kuressaare-hospital", "title": "One coronavirus ward closes at Kuressaare Hospital", "text": "One coronavirus ward closes at Kuressaare Hospital ({{contentCtrl.commentsTotal}})\nOne of the four coronavirus wards at Kuressaare Hospital closed on Saturday and cleaning of the premises has begun.

COVID-19 stands for Corona Virus Disease 19.\n“Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing,” said Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks.” The WHO referenced guidelines set in 2015 that ensure the name does not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people, while still being pronounceable and related to the disease.\nPublic health experts agree with the choice not to name the disease after a geographic region in China.\nIf the new name had included a reference to Wuhan it would put a “tremendous stigmatization on the people of Wuhan who are the victims” of the disease, Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University and public health expert, tells TIME.\n“People tend to think of the disease as belonging to, as being a characteristic of some group of people associated with the place name, which can be really stigmatizing,” Parmet says. “To be thought of as a hole of disease is not going to be productive.

The 1918 influenza pandemic was widely called the Spanish Flu in the U.S., even though it did not originate in Spain. In 2009, the WHO stopped using the term “swine flu” and replaced it with Influenza A (H1N1), following a drop in the pork market. Ebola was named after a river near where the outbreak first originated.\nThe WHO now notes the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the Spanish Flu, Swine Flu and the Chagas disease as examples of names that are should be avoided when looking to name new diseases.\nRelated Stories\nArnold Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health, says it’s important to be sensitive to different cultures when naming a disease. “If you have a name which is regional and it spreads globally, it’s confusing,” Monto says.\nIn the case of the new coronavirus, the WHO has specified a name for the disease but not the virus. The virus has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for the official classification of viruses. The committee recognized the new coronavirus’ similarities to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic that occurred between 2002-2003.\nFor the disease, it’s ideal to have a name that’s easy to pronounce like COVID-19, Parmet says: it’s short, easy to say and two syllables. “You want something that’s easy and that people are going to keep using otherwise they’re going to substitute it with more problematic slang,” she says."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/28/the-guardian-view-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak-leadership-is-required", "title": "The Guardian view on the coronavirus outbreak : leadership is required | Editorial", "text": "The Guardian view on the coronavirus outbreak: leadership is required\nManaging the economic and health risks of Covid-19 is difficult. In the UK, as elsewhere, ministers must step up\nA passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan became the first Briton to die of the Covid-19 coronavirus on Friday. Further UK cases beyond the 20 already confirmed are expected, while countries including Mexico, Nigeria and Denmark have announced their first positive tests. The World Health Organization assesses the level of risk as “very high at global level”. But the scale and impact of the Covid-19 outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, in December, remain deeply uncertain. That is because whle viral outbreaks have happened before, each one is different. While severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) had a higher death rate, Covid-19 appears to be more contagious. Its spread is already being determined in hard-to-predict ways by human behaviour.\nTo limit the damage as far as possible, trust and information are of the essence. In the UK, as elsewhere, it is imperative that the government, and other public bodies, provide straightforward advice about travel and sanitation as well as the disease. For the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to say earlier this week that he would not travel to northern Italy was unwise because it contradicted official guidance. Instead, ministers must lead by example.\nIn recent weeks Boris Johnson has appeared in public rarely. There are circumstances in which a cabinet minister is an effective substitute. But with a threatened pandemic, combined with ongoing floods, leadership is called for. The prime minister, who is often said to have harboured a lifelong ambition to head his country’s government, should now end its petty boycott of key BBC news programmes. It cannot be left to backbench Conservative colleagues such as the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt to encourage people to deal with these unpredictable events in a responsible way. This is all the more important when xenophobic outbursts have been reported, and when the risks associated with panic behaviours such as stockpiling are well known.\nIt is a missed opportunity and a mistake by Mr Johnson not to have called a Cobra meeting before Monday. Governments, businesses and institutions of all sorts face difficult decisions, based on balancing risks. Broadly speaking, these are the dangers of Covid-19 itself, weighed against the disruption caused by any measures, such as school closures or travel restrictions, that are taken to limit its spread. Individuals can find themselves confronting similar dilemmas and, within the parameters set out by advice from councils or employers, will behave differently. “Social distancing”, meaning avoiding hugging and kissing, is recommended. But the threat is not the same for everyone. While fit young adults are likely to recover should they catch Covid-19, older people and those with underlying health conditions are more vulnerable. Every family will contain people with different susceptibilities.\nBeyond the immediate risks to health, experts warn that a recession is likely. Markets have had their worst week since 2008 and central banks are less able to act in the face of a supply-side shock such as this, than they are when demand weakens. The unpredictability of the disease is magnified in the reactions to it of our interconnected global economic systems. It is impossible, too, to know what the political impact will be, except that it will surely be greater if nationalists seek to profit from the disruption to flows of capital, goods and people. But the worst outcomes may still be averted. Political leadership and clear communication are the immediate necessities."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/arts/television/late-night-audience-trump-speech.html", "title": "Pete Buttigieg Hosts  Jimmy Kimmel Live  Without an Audience", "text": "Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy.

Seth Meyers delivered his “A Closer Look” segment in a digital-only “Late Night Casual Thursday” release.\nAnd while all of late night had been set to continue crowdless next week, three of the shows’ respective networks announced Thursday evening that they would be suspended until late March, if not longer.\nEven Teleprompters Can Make Mistakes\nPresident Trump used a teleprompter for his Wednesday night address from the Oval Office, but it still had a number of errors, including his suggestion that all travel from Europe would be suspended (Americans and others are exempt) and that insurance companies would waive co-payments for coronavirus treatment (just for testing, not treatment). He also referred to the virus as “foreign.”\n“I would understand if Trump made mistakes, right, if this whole thing was off the cuff.

It’s just a virus, OK? Trump makes it sound like corona doesn’t speak English.” — TREVOR NOAH\n“During his address, Trump said starting Friday people from Europe can’t fly to the U.S. He was like, ‘We have to stop the virus so instead of everyone flying here, I want everyone to take a cruise.’” — JIMMY FALLON\n“And, also, we can blame Europe for many things — colonialism, skinny jeans, Piers Morgan — but this virus is worldwide, all right?

There were still gaps in understanding that he hoped the WHO’s team of international experts would be able to work towards filling.\nChina has reported 70,365 cases of Covid-19 infection, 2,051 of those in the past 24 hours. The new cases include those confirmed by lab tests and those diagnosed through lung CT scans read by doctors. The vast majority of Chinese cases – 94% – continue to be reported in Hubei province. China says there have been 1,772 deaths. Outside China, there have been 694 cases and four deaths.\nTedros said there appeared to be a decline in the number of new cases in China. “This trend must be interpreted very cautiously. Trends can change.” He said the WHO would continue to work day and night to help countries prepare for the potential arrival of the coronavirus, sending testing kits and protective equipment, working with manufacturers to ensure supplies are maintained, and training health workers.\nHe thanked countries that had contributed towards the $675m (£520m) that the WHO has said it needs to fight the epidemic, but he added: “We have not seen the urgency in the funding that we need. We have a window of opportunity now. We need resources now to ensure countries are prepared now. We don’t know how long this window of opportunity will remain.”\nThe WHO’s director of emergencies, Dr Michael Ryan, said the outbreak should not be described as a pandemic, even though it has spread to 25 countries outside China. “The real issue is whether we are seeing efficient community transmission outside of China and at the present time we are not observing that,” he said.\nDr Sylvie Briand, the director of pandemic and epidemic diseases at the WHO, said the organisation was working closely with Japanese authorities regarding the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off the coast of Japan.\n“We need to make sure that we focus on our objective, our public health objective, which is to contain the virus, and not to contain the people, and making sure that we can have the right balance between the health of the population in Japan and other countries, but also the health of the people being currently on this boat,” she said.\nThere were still many unknowns, she said. “Measures are implemented and assessed currently and monitored on a nearly hourly basis, because we learn every day and every hour more about this disease and this virus.”\nMeanwhile, experts said reports that some people may have incubated the virus for far longer than the 14-day quarantine period before falling ill were likely to be anomalies.\nThe China-based Global Times tweeted that one person had been diagnosed 34 days after being in Wuhan and another 94 days after contact with someone who lived in Wuhan.\nDr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “The last data I saw suggested 95% of people had incubation of less than 12 days. There will be the outlier, the occasional person who has a longer incubation period.” But 34 days and 94 days were extremely unlikely, he said. “Those people will have had another more recent exposure.”\nHe added: “Incubation period is based on best possible evidence. We are learning and gaining new data all the time so [it is] entirely possible it may be revised as the outbreak carries on.”"}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/15/in-russia-coronavirus-patients-fight-infection-stigma-and-harassment-a69993", "title": "In Russia , Coronavirus Patients Fight Infection , Stigma and Harassment", "text": "On a freezing Sunday in Moscow in March, Maria Mukhina received a phone call. The 27-year-old had recently returned from London with what she thought was a winter cold, traveling through Germany and Finland in a rush to get home before Russia sealed its borders to stop the spread of the coronavirus.\nArriving at Terminal F of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport — the hub for all incoming flights from virus hotspots — she had her temperature checked, was swabbed and gave her details to testers in full hazmat suits. A few days later the phone rang.\n“Which apartment are you in? What floor are you on? An ambulance has arrived, they’ll take you now,” said the voice at the end of the line, without introduction. Mukhina had tested positive for Covid-19, and, in line with Russia’s early response to the pandemic, was taken to Moscow’s Kommunarka hospital on the outskirts of the city for isolation until she overcame the infection.\nIn the weeks that followed Mukhina would face stigmatization, suspicion and harassment as she documented her experience battling the coronavirus on social media, driven by online conspiracy theories and what patients see as low understanding of the coronavirus in Russian society.\n“People wrote to me saying that I was a fraud, a liar, that I was making it up to get followers. They said people like me should be burned and that I'm a disgrace to the country,” she told The Moscow Times.\nMukhina’s story is not unique. As the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across Russia at an alarming pace — the official tally of infections is almost 25,000 — Covid-19 patients find themselves fighting not only the infection, but stigma, discrimination and intimidation.\nCoronavirus patients interviewed by The Moscow Times said they have been hounded by avatars and armchair epidemiologists on social media who accuse them of being paid, actors or lying to win public sympathy. At the same time, as more communities find that a virus they don’t understand is on their doorstep, the harassment is spilling into the offline world, with patients reporting bullying, intimidation and leaks of their personal data.\nStigmatization around health issues is not uncommon in Russia. Responding to one instance of online bullying of a Covid-19 sufferer in Kumertau, Bashkortostan, a local politician drew comparisons with the discrimination against HIV/AIDS sufferers in Russia, a phenomenon health experts say has exacerbated that epidemic.\n“There is such an aggressive stigma [surrounding Covid-19] that people can't even leave the hospital,” Irina Kononova, deputy health minister of the region told a local radio station. “Just remember the case of HIV/AIDS, when everyone believed that the patient was to blame and shame. It is still shameful to be ill in Russia. It is shameful to go to the hospital and it is shameful to be treated.”\nFear of the unknown\nIn a special paper on stigma around Covid-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the discrimination stems from three overlapping factors. “First, it is a disease that’s new and for which there are still many unknowns. Second, we are often afraid of the unknown, and third, it is easy to associate that fear with ‘others.’”\nWhile the WHO said anxiety is “understandable,” the harassment and bullying which stem from it exert a heavy toll on patients. The scepticism and conspiracy theories levelled against Mukhina in Moscow grew so intense that she even broadcast a live stream on Instagram from inside the hospital at 2 a.m. one night, showing her catheter in a bid to prove she really did have the virus.\n“I constantly get hateful comments. I’m amazed how angry people can be. They say that I just had pneumonia, not Covid-19, as if they are my doctor or have seen my medical records. It’s very upsetting. It was really difficult for me to return home after being in the hospital, and I still worry how my neighbors will react when I bump into them,” she said.\nMaria Dolgolenko, one of Moscow’s early Covid-19 cases, is another victim of the backlash. She received a barrage of abuse from parents at her son’s school after she was hospitalized. They were furious that Dolgolenko had sent her son to class when she had a fever and the family had just returned from Europe, even though she didn’t know at the time that she was infected with the coronavirus.\n“They were scared, and they started this bullying. They blamed me. I was so happy that I was in the hospital, because I was scared that if I was at home they would be outside my house with stones and torches. Seriously, they were really upset,” Dolgolenko said.\nIn another case in Bryansk, a region close to Russia’s borders with Belarus and Ukraine, churchgoers became the victims of an angry local campaign after it emerged that one could have brought the infection from relatives in Moscow, and almost 100 have since tested positive.\nSome were forced to resign from their jobs amid local anger, according to the Takie Dela news website, while locals have posted calls to burn the church to the ground online and plastered messages reading “Die, scum!” on its doors. “Everybody is acting as if we did it on purpose,” pastor Mikhail Biryukov, who was one of those who caught the virus, said in a video message recorded in hospital.\nData concerns\nPatients fear leaks of their personal data could be playing a part in fuelling the reaction to local “patient zeroes” and stoking social tensions.\n“This is a time when, with very good reason, healthcare providers will be providing information to the authorities about new infections. That means the authorities are going to be in control of a lot of personal confidential data about people’s health status. And this underscores the importance of keeping that data private,” Rachel Denber, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia Division, told The Moscow Times.\nIn Irkutsk, after the names and addresses of a family whose child caught Covid-19 found their way into the public domain, threats against the family in the city’s Viber chat group became so vicious that police officers were stationed outside the family’s home. Authorities say they have launched an investigation into how the family's information was made public.\nIn Moscow, both Mukhina and Dolgolenko slammed a highly controversial map published by Telegram channel Mash, which claims to contain the addresses of hundreds of suspected patients.\n“It sets people against each other at a time when they should be joining together and supporting each other. Crazy people can do anything to a person and their relatives. It's scary. I’m outraged by the data leak, I never gave permission to publish this kind of information about me,” said Mukhina.\nDolgolenko, whose address is not in the database, said the map was “horrible,” while Human Rights Watch’s Denber called it “alarming.”\nMash has not revealed where the unverified data came from and did not respond to requests to comment for this article. The St. Petersburg version of the map claims to include addresses submitted by the public who can report when they spot neighbors being taken to hospital in ambulances.\nHealth stigmas\n“You can definitely feel this stigmatization,” says Dolgolenko. “It’s there right now. And it’s because of this fear.”\nAnastasia Jmukhadze, 38, who is currently in hospital in Moscow with suspected coronavirus said that people are being made to feel guilty about a viral disease, adding that she has seen people’s families speak to them as if they are “lepers” after a positive diagnosis.\n“It’s absurd in the 21st century, but it’s happening. Victim blaming is thriving. If you’re in the hospital, you’re not sick enough to be there and you’re taking somebody else’s place. But if you stay at home, you could be spreading it to other people — there’s no place for you in society.”\nCalling out such stigmatization is important in managing the pandemic, said Human Rights Watch’s Denber.\n“Not only is stigmatization and bullying wrong and unlawful, it is extremely counterproductive,” she said. “It drives people to hide their illness to avoid discrimination, and drives them underground, preventing people from seeking care immediately. Therefore, the government and the authorities have a responsibility to address and condemn that behavior.”\nBut some patients worry that the virus’ rapid acceleration is being matched by a spread in public fear, rather than understanding.\n“I’m not sure people will become less scared,” said Dolgolenko. “As the numbers of sick people grow, there’s no reason to be less scared. And it’s normal to want to blame somebody for that.”"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whos-most-at-risk-from-the-coronavirus-11584048476", "title": "Who Most at Risk From the Coronavirus", "text": "- Life & Arts\n- Health\n- Journal Reports: Health Care\nWho’s Most at Risk From the Coronavirus\nTens of millions of Americans are older or have underlying conditions that increase the chance the coronavirus will make them seriously ill\nAs the new coronavirus spreads around the world, health officials are repeatedly assuring the public: Your risk of getting seriously ill or dying is very low—unless you are older or have an underlying condition.\nThat is a lot of people, including millions of Americans.\nData from China, where the epidemic began, show death rates that are startlingly higher than the average for people age 60 and over, as well as for people with high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma and other chronic conditions.

The number of Americans 65 and over rose 27% between 2011 and 2018 to 52.4 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, while the under-65 cohort grew 2%. Older Americans make up 16% of the U.S. population.\nAbout 46% of American adults have high blood pressure, according to guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. About 34.2 million people, or 10.5% of the U.S. population, have diabetes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nChina’s statistics are from the early weeks of an explosive epidemic in which hospitals were overwhelmed and doctors struggled to figure out how best to care for patients struck with a new disease. Death rates in less-hard-hit parts of China have been lower, and have come down for the whole country over time, according to the World Health Organization.\nPrecise death rates are also unclear because it isn’t known how many people have actually been infected. Many have either not been ill enough to suspect they had the disease, or haven’t had access to a test.\nStill, the data show that people with aging or taxed immune systems have a far more difficult time fighting off Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n“It’s very clear that this virus has greater mortality and morbidity in older individuals and those with chronic conditions,” says Mark Mulligan, director of NYU Langone Health’s division of infectious diseases and immunology in New York. Morbidity is the rate of a disease’s presence in a population.\nOlder people are generally at higher risk of becoming severely ill from infectious diseases, such as the flu, Dr. Mulligan notes. As people age, the immune system undergoes “immunosenescence,” gradually losing its ability to mount a response to an infection as robustly as it once did. Precisely how that happens is an active subject of study. Among the changes, the thymus, an organ of the immune system, shrinks starting at young adulthood. T-cells, soldiers of the immune system which mature in the thymus, lose some of their function.\nEarly Signs\nInitial deaths in the U.S. and South Korea show similar demographic patterns.\nDeaths by age group, as of March 11\nU.S.\nSouth Korea\nUnder 10\nUnder 10\n10-19\n10-19\n20-29\n20-29\n30-39\n30-39\n40-49\n40-49\n50-59\n50-59\n60-69\n60-69\n70-79\n70-79\n80+\n80+\nUnknown\nDeaths by age group, as of March 11\nU.S.\nSouth Korea\nUnder 10\nUnder 10\n10-19\n10-19\n20-29\n20-29\n30-39\n30-39\n40-49\n40-49\n50-59\n50-59\n60-69\n60-69\n70-79\n70-79\n80+\n80+\nUnknown\nDeaths by age group, as of March 11\nU.S.\nSouth Korea\nUnder 10\nUnder 10\n10-19\n10-19\n20-29\n20-29\n30-39\n30-39\n40-49\n40-49\n50-59\n50-59\n60-69\n60-69\n70-79\n70-79\n80+\n80+\nUnknown\nInitial deaths in the U.S. and South Korea show similar demographic patterns.\nDeaths by age group, as of March 11\nU.S.\nUnder 10\n10-19\n20-29\n30-39\n40-49\n50-59\n60-69\n70-79\n80+\nUnknown\nSouth Korea\nUnder 10\n10-19\n20-29\n30-39\n40-49\n50-59\n60-69\n70-79\n80+\nSources: local health officials (U.S.); Sang Woo Park, Princeton University (South Korea)\nOlder people often don’t develop high fevers as a result—and a temperature not regularly recognized as a serious fever may be missed or mistaken for another problem, says XinQi Dong, director of the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research at Rutgers University. Thus, says Dr. Dong, “100.5 may be a true fever” possibly indicating the presence of Covid-19.\nLung function also declines with age, making respiratory diseases a particularly serious threat for older people, he says.\nOlder people are more likely to have serious underlying conditions that also put them—and younger people—at risk of complications from Covid-19. Cardiovascular disease, diabetes and lung diseases all tax the body, making infections harder to fight off, says Bruce Ribner, director of Emory University School of Medicine’s Serious Communicable Diseases Unit. “The system is just not able to put up with that much of an assault,” he says.\nHigh blood glucose impairs the ability of white blood cells to fight infections in people with diabetes, Dr. Ribner says. Viruses can settle more easily into people whose lungs are impaired from a lung disease, he says.\nScientists say they are trying to learn more about the apparent link seen in China between severe Covid-19 and high blood pressure. People with cardiovascular disease often have lung diseases, too, and generally are more susceptible to flu and viral pneumonia, experts say.\nCovid-19 has already exacted a heavy toll on older, sicker Americans, claiming at least 22 lives in one nursing home in a Seattle-area outbreak that public health officials are struggling to contain. Health officials say Italy’s aging population is a big reason behind the large outbreak and high current death rate of 5% in that country. Death rates for some older people have also been higher than they are for the overall population in a large outbreak in South Korea.\nItaly and China have higher smoking rates, which may be a factor in their high death rates among older adults, says Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics. Dr. Lipsitch says he expects mortality rates to be higher for vulnerable people than for the overall population in the U.S., though how much higher is hard to tell.\nU.S. health officials have urged Americans who are vulnerable to limit travel and avoid large crowds. The risks to such people are “considerable,” says Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n“If you are a person with an underlying condition and you are particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition, you need to think twice about getting on a plane on a long trip,” Dr. Fauci said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” this week. “And not only think twice, just don’t get on a cruise ship.”\nThe U.S. government has urged nursing homes to restrict visitor access, to reduce the risk of spread.\nPeople at higher risk should heed the same precautions that exist for everyone—wash hands regularly, stay away from sick people and keep up-to-date on vaccines for flu and pneumonia, the U.S. CDC and infectious-disease experts say.\nThey should avoid large gatherings, limit close contact with others when out in public, and stay home as much as possible to reduce risk of exposure, according to the U.S.\nThat likely means no church or theater. “For now, do not congregate in places with a lot of people,” Dr. Dong says. “I would not go to bingo parlors.”\nBut a bridge game with a few trusted friends—who aren’t sick—is OK, he says. It’s important to stay socially connected even if physical connection is limited. Connecting by phone or video with older relatives who are alone is a good idea, he says.\nSocial isolation has been linked to adverse health outcomes, Dr. Dong says. “Being isolated is one of the worst things one can experience.”\nMs. McKay is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

(AP) — Nebraska state government could see a boost to its emergency fund over the next few months, based on new estimates released Friday, but the COVID-19 virus and a panicked stock market are tempering some of those expectations.\nMembers of the Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board predicted that the state will collect $5.2 billion in tax revenue during the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. That’s about $115 million more than the previous projections, and by law, that excess money will go into Nebraska state government’s cash reserve fund.\nIf the estimates are accurate, the cash reserve that’s commonly used for emergencies and one-time expenses would grow to about $731 million. But board members warned that the outlook could change quickly given the last week’s market selloff and growing fears about the virus, also known as the novel coronavirus.\n“Whatever forecast we end up with today, it’s going to be the best-case scenario,” board member Richard McGinnis said.\nIn the next fiscal year, board members predicted the state will receive $5.175 billion, just $25 million higher than their previous estimate.\nTom Bergquist, the director of the Legislature’s Fiscal Office, said it’s too early to know what effect the scares will have on state revenue.\n“There’d be some significant declines if this continues to go on,” he said.\nNebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts said in an interview that the new forecast still gives lawmakers the opportunity to fulfill his top priority of lowering property taxes. He said state officials are monitoring the situation with the COVID-19 virus and will respond accordingly.\n“This increased forecast eases the Legislature’s pathway to delivering over $500 million of property tax relief this session,” Ricketts said in a statement after the new estimates were approved. “As one famous Nebraskan would say, ’Let’s git-r-done!”\nBoard member Tonn Ostergard said the virus is already affecting the global supply chain that serves Nebraska businesses. Even so, “the economy of Nebraska basically is strong,” he said.\nBoard member Steve Seline said the upcoming presidential election could also sway the markets, which in turn would influence state tax collections. On the flip side, he said the flood-recovery efforts in parts of Nebraska have given a boost to the local economy.\nThe virus and other factors such as U.S. tariffs, the 2017 federal tax cuts and the cost of Nebraska’s tax incentives will create a good deal of uncertainty for lawmakers as they update their budget, said Renee Fry, executive director of the OpenSky Policy Institute, a tax-policy think tank.\n“More money in the cash reserve is a good thing for the state, particularly if there is economic fallout from a potential pandemic,” Fry said.\n___\nFollow Grant Schulte on Twitter: https://twitter.com/GrantSchulte"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/5624a77cb07914824586ff7bfe611464", "title": "Iran raises its death toll to 19 amid 139 coronavirus cases", "text": "An increasingly isolated Iran tries to control virus crisis\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran girded Wednesday for a long battle against the coronavirus that is spreading rapidly across the country and the wider Middle East, even though officials in the Islamic Republic had earlier minimized the outbreak that has now killed 19 people, the highest toll outside of China.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani said there were no immediate plans to quarantine cities, but he acknowledged it may take “one, two or three weeks” to get control of the virus in Iran, which has been linked to most of the over 210 confirmed cases in the region.\nAs Iran’s 80 million people find themselves increasingly isolated in the region by the outbreak, the country’s sanctions-battered economy saw its currency slump to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar in a year.\nRouhani sought to portray the virus crisis in terms of Iran’s tense relationship with the U.S., which under President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from its nuclear deal with world powers and sent its economy into freefall.\n“We must not let the United States attach a new virus to the coronavirus by stopping our social activities through tremendous fear. This is a conspiracy we see today and you see in foreign propaganda,” Rouhani said at a Cabinet meeting, according to a transcript on the presidency’s website.\n“They are also suffering from coronavirus. Influenza has killed 16,000 people in the United States, but they are not speaking about themselves. Americans better take care of thousands of flu casualties in their own country,” he said.\nThe comments by Rouhani came as Iran appeared to be slowly coming to grips with the scope of the crisis.\nIn Tehran overnight, mass transit workers disinfected buses and the capital’s subway system, removing overhead handles to try to limit surfaces where the virus could rest. Traffic again appeared lighter on Tehran’s normally gridlocked roads amid a winter rain. Signs warned Iranians not to touch surfaces in crowded areas.\nIn Qom, the Shiite holy city south of Tehran that government statistics say has been hit hardest by the virus, photos published by the judiciary’s Mizan news agency showed doctors wearing high-end face masks.\nThe masks are difficult to find in Iran, as is alcohol-based hand sanitizer and other materials, because Iranian law typically prohibits the import of items that can be made locally. Those rules have been loosened in the crisis.\nHealth Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 19 people have died from the illness, which is named COVID-19, with 139 confirmed cases in the country. The World Health Organization says the virus has infected more than 80,000 people globally, causing over 2,700 deaths, mainly in China.\nThe first two cases of the virus were reported Wednesday by the government of neighboring Pakistan, with one of the infected patients having traveled to Iran with his family.\nExperts are concerned that Iran may be underreporting cases and deaths, given its rapid spread from Iran across the Persian Gulf. Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, a hard-line lawmaker. has alleged there have been 50 deaths in Qom alone, which the government denies.\nFigures released Wednesday still showed no cases confirmed in the Iranian city of Mashhad, even though a number of cases reported in Kuwait are linked to there.\n“We must be optimistic, because pessimism causes us to attract this disease,” said Afsaneh Azarloo, a Tehran resident. “We should be optimistic and hope that nothing bad will happen to us.”\nThat optimism was not shared by another passer-by, who gave his name only as Saeed.\n“I’m worried. It’s the first time I have left home after a week,” he said. “My home is now my workplace too.”\nThat pessimism is widespread, especially after the top official in charge of Iran’s response to the coronavirus tested positive for the illness after trying to play down the disease a day earlier.\nIran’s Cyber Police reported that 24 people were arrested and 118 other were warned about “spreading rumors” on the internet about the virus.\n“Coronavirus must not be turned into a weapon for our enemies to halt work and production in our country,” Rouhani said.\nIran’s currency, the rial, fell to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar in a year, likely pushed by the country’s neighbors closing borders and air routes. The rial traded at 160,000 to $1. At the time of Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2015, it traded at 32,000 to $1.\nRouhani’s estimate of up to three weeks to control the virus followed efforts by officials repeatedly to minimize its threat.\nThat has sparked more concern among Iranians already angry over nationwide economic protests, the U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general and Iran accidentally shooting down a Ukrainian jetliner and then denying it for days. The Feb. 21 parliamentary election also saw the country’s lowest recorded turnout.\nJahanpour suggested Tuesday it could take as long as late April to control the virus. And with the Persian New Year, or Nowruz, coming on March 20, experts worry it could worsen.\n“Containment of the COVID-19 virus within Iran will be a challenge because of Iran’s poor health infrastructure and traditional unwillingness to communicate freely and openly across all branches of government and between health institutions,” the Austin, Texas private intelligence firm Stratfor said.\nThat worry was echoed by analysts at the Eurasia Group.\n“Tehran is likely significantly underestimating the risk posed by an outbreak of coronavirus to its citizens, economy and neighbors,” they wrote. “Iran has a relatively robust public health system, although it has been weakened by U.S. sanctions. But a breakdown in national-level decision-making has severely hampered its ability contain the spread of the virus.”\n___\nAssociated Press journalists Amir Vahdat, Saeed Sarmadi and Mehdi Fattahi in Tehran, Iran, and Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed."}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/03/07/tourism-flows-and-death-rates-suggest-covid-19-is-being-under-reported", "title": "Tracking the stealthy killer - Tourism flows and death rates suggest covid - 19 is being under - reported | Graphic detail", "text": "IN RECENT WEEKS covid-19, a deadly new disease, has slowed in China but spread widely elsewhere. China’s strict quarantine has led to a 90% decline in new infections, whereas outbreaks in Italy and Iran have grown rapidly. In the last week of February 70% of new diagnoses were outside of China. As covid-19 reaches countries unwilling or unable to monitor it, officials must use educated guesswork to track its evolution.\nThe number of cases each country reports depends both on the number of infections and on how many people get tested. By March 1st South Korea had tested over 100,000 people; America just 472.\nTo estimate the number of undetected cases, scholars can make use of patterns in more complete data. One model, built by a team at Harvard, used the number of people flying from Hubei province in China, where the outbreak began, to various countries to predict imported cases. Such data are less relevant now, because Hubei has been locked down for a month.\nTo derive fresh estimates, The Economist built a similar model. We tested the link within the OECD—a club of mostly rich countries, which should have strong detection capacity—between Chinese tourism in 2019 and confirmed covid-19 cases. As expected, OECD states that swapped lots of tourists with China, such as Switzerland, tend to report higher infection rates than do ones with small flows, like Belgium.\nApplied worldwide, our model finds big outliers. The outbreaks in Iran, Italy and South Korea, where the virus is spreading internally, are bigger than tourist flows suggest. At the other extreme, countries like Singapore may have fewer diagnoses than expected because of strong containment efforts. But the Philippines, Russia, Myanmar and Indonesia have lots of people and tourism to and from China, and just eight confirmed cases in total. Thousands more have probably gone undetected.\nAnother pattern bolsters this finding. South Korea and China test regularly. In both places—excluding Hubei, where the virus began claiming lives before authorities formulated a response—0.5-1% of people who have tested positive have died. In other countries with at least one death, this rate is five times higher. Deaths are easier to count than infections are. The most likely explanation for this gap is that for every person diagnosed in these countries, four more do not know they are infected. ■\nSources: Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China; Johns Hopkins CSSE; WHO\nThis article appeared in the Graphic detail section of the print edition under the headline \"Tracking the stealthy killer\""}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/snl-elizabeth-warren-cold-open-coronavirus-c97bb7e6-1865-412b-9f1e-31112fd67746.html", "title": "  SNL : Elizabeth Warren appears in cold open on coronavirus", "text": "\"SNL\": Elizabeth Warren makes surprise appearance in cold open\nSen.

The holiday is over, but few people are back in offices and factories. In Hubei province (of which Wuhan is the capital) the tally of confirmed cases of the disease now known as covid-19 leapt on February 12th after officials widened the definition. The next day the Communist Party sacked the officials who run the province and the city. Abroad, too, both medical and economic woes are spreading. Many multinational firms have been caught unprepared. Our leader argues that investors are optimistic that the effects of covid-19 will be like those of SARS in 2003: a sharp shock to Chinese growth, followed by a strong rebound. But SARS may not be a reliable guide. China’s economy accounts for 16% of GDP today, up from just 4% then. It has become enmeshed in supply chains of mind-boggling complexity, and just-in-time production leaves little room for delays.\nOur cover leader this week argues that the unification of Ireland is becoming likelier. One reason is Sinn Fein’s stunning performance in the republic’s general election on February 8th. A party that long acted as the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, which bombed and shot its way through decades of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, won most first-preference votes. It did so on a promise to spend more on public services, appealing to voters seeking an alternative to the old centre-right duopoly of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. But two other factors also make unity more likely. One is Brexit: Northern Ireland voted Remain, and unification would allow it to rejoin the EU. The other is demography. At partition in 1922, Northern Irish Protestants outnumbered Catholics by two to one. Now Catholics may outnumber them. There are obstacles to unification, and many uncertainties, but momentum could come to seem unstoppable. The island of Ireland needs a plan.\nBy autumn 2021 Germany will have a new chancellor. It won’t be Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. The leader of the Christian Democratic Union—senior partner in the country’s governing coalition—said on February 10th that she would step down. A debacle in the eastern state of Thuringia, where the CDU voted with the far-right Alternative for Germany to install a member of a third party as state premier, proved one gaffe too many. When she was elected leader in 2018, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer had seemed sure to succeed Angela Merkel in the chancellery. Now the CDU faces another leadership battle. Our leader argues that the party seems to have little consensus on its core principles: while it decides, policy paralysis has descended. The greatest favour Mrs Merkel could do her country would be to force the pace—by announcing her imminent departure.\nAt 128 months and counting, America’s economic expansion is the longest on record. Its durability—it has weathered global manufacturing downturns, monetary tightening and a trade war—is due in part to faster growth in wages for workers at the bottom of the income distribution than for the better-paid. As our Free exchange column notes, that reflects not only a tightening labour market but also increases in state and local minimum-wage rates. According to one estimate, these have risen by a third, on average, in the past ten years (after adjusting for inflation). We report elsewhere that faster wage growth may also be connected to lower immigration, and hence less competition for low-paid jobs. Over time, however, employers may switch to less labour-intensive production, offsetting the short-term boost to pay.\nAccording to cliché, estate agents rival journalists for unpopularity. And according to our leader this week, they deserve their bad rap, at least in America. The scale of the commissions they extract is jaw-dropping: 5-6% of the value of a property, three times the average in other rich countries. Other marketplaces have been transformed by technology, but although cheaper online realtors are making inroads, fees have not budged. Obsolete practices persist. Because sellers pay buyers’ fees as well as their own, for example, buyers’ agents have an incentive to steer clients away from properties with lower fees. Trustbusters should ensure that agents are free to compete and that industry databases are accessible at reasonable prices—and open the door to lower fees."}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/freedom-of-the-press-information-offer-on-covid-19-for-iran/a-53040932", "title": "Freedom of the press : Information offer on COVID - 19 for Iran | Press Releases | DW", "text": "Despite censorship, DW is providing information on COVID-19 in Farsi to people in Iran.\nInformation, facts, clarification - the need for concrete and reliable answers with respect to the corona pandemic is enormous.

In today’s newsletter: Why the coronavirus outbreak could bring out the worst in Trump. Plus: Is Bernie Sanders as polarizing as elite Democrats claim he is?\n*\n« TODAY IN POLITICS »\n(HAPPY TOGETHER / SHUTTERSTOCK / ARSH RAZIUDDIN / THE ATLANTIC)\nThe Trump administration isn’t ready for the coronavirus.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, as the illness is now called, has thrown the world into panic. But if it spreads across the U.S., it could bring out the worst in President Donald Trump, who on top of a tendency to prefer his own instincts to the advice of experts, is famously a germaphobe.\nEmpathy may be a casualty of Trump’s own phobias: He is squeamish about contagion. A body man traveling with him would make sure that two implements were always in his possession: a Sharpie for autographs and hand sanitizer for germs, said a former White House official, who like others I talked with for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity. Aides would try to suppress coughs in his presence. If they couldn’t stifle repeated sneezes, Trump might order them to leave his presence. “He never said, ‘Go home.’ He just didn’t want them anywhere near him,” the ex-official told me.\nWhen an Ebola epidemic struck in 2014, Trump was unnerved. For months, he sent dire messages with a common theme: Keep the virus out of the U.S. at all costs.\nMy colleague Peter Nicholas reports on the nightmare scenario of the outbreak reaching the U.S.\nWould a quarantine of the scale China is implementing now—extended beyond the Wuhan epicenter to more than 50 million elsewhere in China—be possible in the U.S.?\nA legal mess would certainly result, Polly Price, a global health professor, writes:\nThe average American may be surprised to learn who holds the authority to order such public-health measures. Except at the nation’s borders, the federal government, with the expertise of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is not in charge. America’s defense against epidemics is divided among 2,684 state, local, and tribal public-health departments. Each one is responsible for monitoring people within its jurisdiction, imposing isolation or quarantine as needed. CDC officials are “preparing as if [the new coronavirus] is the next pandemic,” but in reality, the laboring oar falls to state and local health departments.\nRead the rest."}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-what-the-world-could-learn-from-africa/a-53259048", "title": "COVID - 19 : What the world can learn from Africa | Africa | DW", "text": "Africa's number of coronavirus infections is rising, and with it the fear of a catastrophe. But the continent has a vast knowledge in dealing with infectious diseases that could help stem the spread of COVID-19.\nThe global coronavirus crisis is paralyzing African metropolises. In Johannesburg, South Africa's economic capital, the military was deployed to monitor the imposed curfews. In Uganda's otherwise lively capital Kampala, markets and shops remain closed. Only a few boda bodas (motorbike taxis) run the streets. The motorbikes are no longer permitted to carry passengers but are instead being used for delivery services and running errands.\nLife is also slowing down in other African cities. For any kind of \"normalcy\" to return, the coronavirus pandemic must be contained as soon as possible.\nThis is exactly what some African states could benefit from said Ahmed Ogwell Ouma, deputy director of the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).\nSenegal is leading the way by coming up with simple and economic solutions such as this 3D printer which makes face masks\nHe commended the rapid action of African governments: \"This is a lesson we learned during the 2014 Ebola crisis in West Africa,\" Ogwell Ouma said. \"We intervened quickly, with the means, knowledge and proven social partners in the communities that have already been tested in the population.\" This has contributed to the low infection rates in Africa so far, Ouma said during an online panel discussion on the topic: \"COVID-19 - early lessons from Africa.\"\nAfrica not a defenseless victim\nDespite the early successes, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that Africa could be more affected by COVID-19 than other regions of the world. But Africa is not a defenseless victim of the pandemic. This view is also held by Robert Kappel, professor emeritus at the Institute of African Studies at the University of Leipzig. \"We have a lesson to learn. Also, in our perception of Africa, that the African continent is not the continent of pandemics, of health and economic crises,\" Kappel told DW. \"Africa is a continent that takes things into its own hands, in very different ways.\"\nAccording to Gavin Churchyard, chairman of the Aurum Institute — a South African health care institute — keeping distance and infection control are not new concepts for the African population due to the long-standing fight against the lung disease tuberculosis. Even existing educational materials on tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS can be used in the fight against COVID-19, with slight modifications.\n\"In contrast to some industrialized countries, African countries have opted for scientifically sound solutions. We have seen leadership emerge in African countries like nowhere else,\" Churchyard said.\nHome-grown innovative ideas\nKappel praised the local commitment of innovative small and medium-sized companies. They have become important players in the production of pharmaceutical products. For example, masks or disinfectants.\n\"There is a lot to learn here by also trusting in local knowledge, which is available in African countries,\" Kappel said. Many start-ups were also partly supported by the state and played an important role in supplying the medical equipment to the population.\nLife in Uganda's capital Kampala has drastically changed due to the coronavirus pandemic\nThe successful fight against Ebola and other infectious diseases shows that it is not always a question of receiving a lot of international aid or huge sums of money. These would indeed be necessary if the number of infections increased and the crisis got out of hand.\nSo far, it appears in the first phase of the coronavirus crisis, local communities, civil society organizations and village chiefs have managed to limit the spread. Another advantage was that the virus reached Africa relatively late, giving the continent extra time for preparations.\nThe crisis as an opportunity\nThe fact that Africa is anything but a helpless continent was recently emphasized by African intellectuals in two open letters. Among them, the Senegalese writer and musician Felwine Sarr, the Cameroonian political scientist Achille Mbembe and the Nigerian Nobel Prize for Literature winner Wole Soyinka.\nIn the letters, the three demanded that Africa must provide \"a fundamental, powerful and sustainable response to a real threat that should neither be exaggerated nor minimized, but rather tackled rationally.\"\nThey called on their governments to use the situation to emerge stronger from the crisis. Health systems need to be transformed, raw materials should finally be processed locally, and the economy should be more diversified.\nUta Steinwehr contributed to this article."}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/overlay/media/en/usa-staggers-under-corona-onslaught/53053796/53054629", "title": "", "text": "The US government is warning its citizens to expect hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 deaths.

Deaths are fewer than in other countries, the state helps ailing firms and workers and the politicians seem level-headed and competent. Places with more erratic leadership have noted the contrast. British journalists ask their politicians why they can’t emulate Germany’s testing rates. American television networks urge Jens Spahn, the health minister, to reveal Germany’s secrets. One columnist even mused that Angela Merkel, the chancellor, might serve as Joe Biden’s running-mate.\nThe true picture is more complicated. “We can’t say we’re perfect and everything was planned,” says Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, a virologist at the University of Hamburg. Testing was crucial, but relied on an existing network of nearly 200 private and public laboratories that ramped up capacity after a Berlin hospital developed a test in January, before politicians knew a crisis was coming. “Other countries had to build labs, we already have them,” says Evangelos Kotsopoulos, the boss of the German arm of Sonic Healthcare, a private lab network. Germany now conducts 350,000 tests a week, and could do many more.\nSecond, while national politicians and health officials dithered, local authorities acted quickly to close public places and track contacts of the infected when early outbreaks were detected in parts of Bavaria and the Rhineland. Germany was also lucky, says Karl Lauterbach, an MP and epidemiologist. It received an “early warning” from Italy, and many of the first to be infected were young, which kept hospitalisations and deaths down (though they are now climbing). Germany used the time this bought to flatten the curve of infections.\nBuilding on its early success in isolating cases will be crucial as Germany moves to the next stage of the crisis. Mrs Merkel wants to track every chain of infection. That means yet more tests—reportedly up to 4.5m a week if supply constraints can be overcome—and rigorously chasing contacts of the newly infected. Apps may help, notwithstanding privacy worries (see article), but most work will be done by thousands of “containment scouts” in Germany’s 400-odd overworked and underfunded public-health offices.\nThe fiscal response also builds on old foundations. To protect workers’ income, Germany has ramped up Kurzarbeitergeld (money for short-time work), an established system under which the state covers 60-87% of the forgone wages of workers whose hours are cut. It has pledged hundreds of billions in guarantees for bridging loans, and set up a €50bn ($54bn) fund for freelancers and small companies. After a few hiccups, implementation has been largely smooth. Yet as recession bites, more is needed. On April 22nd the cabinet agreed a further €10bn stimulus package.\nThe measures smash Germany’s hallowed no-deficit rule. But for Olaf Scholz, the finance minister, this is a feature, not a bug: Germany can spend in bad times because it saved in good. The size of its response, says Oliver Rakau at the Oxford Economics consultancy, means Germany may muddle through better than other EU countries. And though its car industry ceased production for a while (see article), sectors like chemicals and steel kept working. Electricity usage and mobility data suggest the slowdown has been less acute than in France, Spain or Italy. Still, the Bundesbank expects a “severe” recession and the IMF forecasts a 7% contraction this year, deeper than in 2009. The openness of its economy leaves Germany especially vulnerable to severed supply chains and slumping foreign demand, even once domestic consumption resumes.\nThe pace of recovery will also depend on how quickly restrictions are eased. With the number of recorded infections now rising by only 1-2% each day Germany is tentatively opening up, starting with smaller shops, and classes for children facing exams. By European standards the lockdown was late and lenient. But perhaps because Germany was less affected than its neighbours, the consensus behind it is crumbling. Larger retailers are chafing. So are working parents facing kindergarten closures that may last for months. Such rows play out in the fractious negotiations Mrs Merkel must conduct with the leaders of Germany’s 16 states. This week she was reported to have lamented the “orgies” of debate over who may open when, fearing they cloud the risks of fresh waves of infection.\nThe chancellor, a scientist fluent in the argot of reproduction rates and risk management, is “perfect” for this situation, says Karin Prien, a minister in the state of Schleswig-Holstein and a party colleague. Mrs Merkel’s approval ratings are nudging 80% and her Christian Democratic Union is soaring in the polls; some quietly hope she may break her pledge to stand down at next year’s election. Yet, notes Thorsten Benner of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think-tank, her talents may have been better suited to the first stage of the crisis, which demanded calm competence, rather than the awkward trade-offs of the next. Unlike Sebastian Kurz, chancellor of Austria, which locked down early and hard and is now easing more quickly, she has not found a vision of recovery to leaven her message of caution.\nThere have been wobbles as well as wins. The government has struggled to step up production of face-masks, for example, although all 16 states now mandate their use. And the cross-party consensus forged in adversity is now starting to crack. Yet Germany’s successes in managing the outbreak are undeniable. The fact that it is now arguing vigorously about what comes next is not the least among them. ■\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus tracker and story hub\nThis article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline \"Top of the class?\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/science/coronavirus-pangolin-wildlife-ban-china.html", "title": "China Ban on Wildlife Trade a Big Step , but Has Loopholes , Conservationists Say", "text": "China this week announced a permanent ban on wildlife trade and consumption that international conservationists greeted as a major step, but one with troublesome loopholes for trade in wild animals for medicinal uses.\nA wild animal market in Wuhan may have been where the outbreak of Covid-19 began, and pangolins, in particular, have been proposed as a possible host of the virus before it jumped to people.\nChina had already banned the wildlife markets.

But modeling a disease in mid-pandemic isn't easy, and important nuance can be lost in the translation between academic modelers and policymakers.\nDriving the news: During the White House briefing on Tuesday, Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx displayed graphs showing government projections that even with mitigation, COVID-19 would kill as many as 240,000 people in the months ahead. It was the first time the White House had officially estimated the potential death toll.\n- What Fauci and his colleagues are trying to do is \"flatten the curve\" — taking steps now to reduce the speed of COVID-19's spread and therefore prevent hospital systems from being overloaded. The shape of that curve is the product of mathematical disease modeling.\n- To simplify things — which is the point of a model — mathematical modelers take known data like the past number of cases, plug in estimates for things they don't know, and create models for how an outbreak will progress.\n- If those models are accurate, they can help policymakers visualize how an unchecked outbreak will play out and take effective steps to protect their populations.\nYes, but: Any attempt to predict the future will be imperfect, and the less modelers know for certain, the more weight they need to put on their estimates. That's especially true for a new disease, so we've seen models spit out a wide range of potential outcomes for COVID-19 — sometimes by the same modelers.\n- Early COVID-19 models by a team at Imperial College London assumed that demand for intensive care units would be roughly the same as previously modeled flu pandemics. The result was a milder forecast that initially encouraged the U.K. government to adopt a \"mitigation\" strategy with relatively little social distancing.\n- But when data from China and Italy showed that COVID-19 patients required intensive care at much higher proportions, the same team revised its models, predicting that a laissez-faire strategy could lead to as many as 500,000 deaths in the U.K. alone.\n- The British government eventually abandoned mitigation in favor of a near-total lockdown.\nBe smart: As the famous saying (among modelers) attributed to the British statistician George Box goes: \"All models are wrong, but some are useful\" — meaning that perfect prediction is impossible, but a rigorous model can help politicians see how their actions might bend an outbreak one way or another.\n- The problem is that politicians and mathematical modelers don't speak the same language and don't move at the same pace, especially during an outbreak.\n- \"Sometimes you need an immediate answer, not one in five days,\" says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist and modeler at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who earlier worked with the federal government.\n- It's notable that while other governments publish data-rich updates on the epidemiology of COVID-19, the best dashboard in the U.S. is updated by academics at Johns Hopkins — not the U.S. government.\nOne possible solution is to try to bridge the gap between the mathematicians who model diseases and the politicians who respond to them.\n- In a new report, Rivers and her colleagues suggest creating the equivalent of a National Weather Service for disease modeling. The proposed federal institution would provide authoritative disease models during outbreaks and embed modelers in the government so that both cultures can learn from each other.\n\"Right now with modeling the outbreak, it's as if we're building the plane as we're flying it. If it was already there, it would be much smoother and more effective.\"— Caitlin Rivers\nThe bottom line: Because there's so much we still don't know about COVID-19 — and because the field mostly remains an academic endeavor — the models that are being produced are likely flawed. But they remain the best intelligence we have in the war on the pandemic."}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/28/at-least-100-000-could-die-from-covid-19-in-syria-warn-ngos", "title": "At least 100 , 000 could die from COVID - 19 in Syria , warn NGOs", "text": "At least 100,000 could die from the COVID-19 pandemic in northwest Syria as overcrowded camps and the decimated healthcare system make the country particularly vulnerable, medical staff on the ground have warned.\n\"In one year, we lost around 76 health facilities in northwest Syria,\" Dr Munzer al-Khalil, from the Idlib Health Directorate, said in a statement released by the Syria Free campaign.\n\"Donors have cut their funds and medical staff have been killed, arrested or displaced.

Their approaches to the epidemic itself have been different, too. Whereas India’s order for a strict 21-day lockdown came directly from Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an 8pm speech, Pakistan’s de facto ban was enacted haphazardly at the provincial level, and then grudgingly acknowledged by Mr Khan.\nThe details of the restrictions differ, too. India’s are strict and no-nonsense. Multiple videos have captured police thwacking anyone they catch on the roads, including doctors trying to reach hospitals, delivery men and people looking for food. The ban includes all religious services, of any faith. Pakistan is wary of going so far. Although it has nearly twice as many covid-19 cases as India, and despite glaring evidence that the return of Shia pilgrims from Iran, as well as a jamboree that brought tens of thousands of Sunni missionaries to Lahore, were big sources of infection, the government has merely urged imams to discourage communal services and to suggest that the faithful pray at home instead.\nYet for all the differences, the reasoning behind the unco-ordinated drive to lock down a fifth of humanity is shared. In mid-March, as the number of cases in both India and Pakistan began to rise into the hundreds, the inadequacy of both countries’ medical infrastructure stood alarmingly exposed. China, for instance, can muster 18 doctors and 42 hospital beds per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation. India has just eight doctors and seven hospital beds for the same number of people, and Pakistan ten doctors and six hospital beds. India has at most 40,000 or so working ventilators, equipment that has proved life-saving for the most severely affected covid-19 patients. In contrast America, with a quarter as many people, has four times as many functioning ones. Pakistan has only 2,200 ventilators and these are poorly distributed: the 12m people of Balochistan make do with 49 machines, fewer than a single hospital in Lahore.\nSimply put, both countries needed to put a stop to the spread of the disease by any means possible, or risk being swamped by dying patients. Curfews and lockdowns, backed by police muscle and softened by government handouts, as well as by calls to patriotism, are the cheaper option. The Indian Council of Medical Research, the government body that has led India’s effort, estimates that strict social distancing may reduce the total number of expected cases by 62%. More crucially for India’s health system, it would reduce the peak number of sick people by nearly 90%.\nRewarding idleness\nThis will not come cheap. Mr Khan on March 24th announced a 1trn rupee ($7bn) support package, cutting fuel prices and earmarking money for the poor. Mr Modi is spending $23bn to provide free food and cash transfers to India’s poorest. He is also boosting funding for health care and support for farmers. State governments in India have been more generous still, with some paying pensions in advance and others paying a month’s wage to all migrant construction workers. Such fillips are vital, say economists. The lockdown has brought most factories to a standstill, including the entire car industry.\nBut the pain is felt hardest in the informal sector, which accounts for over 70% of the workforce in both countries. For the middle class in both India and Pakistan, the lockdowns have meant nothing worse than claustrophobia and doing without servants. For the poor they are devastating: within hours of the closure thousands of homeless had collected outside free kitchens in Delhi, India’s capital, not knowing where else to go.\nMr Khan has expressed anguish for the poor and Mr Modi has repeatedly asked employers to be kind to workers, as well as suggesting that each wealthy family take care of nine less fortunate ones during the 21-day lockdown. He even asked citizens to look after stray animals that are no longer being fed. Yet many Indians question why, despite such shows of sympathy, the prime minister neglected to say that groceries and pharmacies would remain open. The predictable result was a mad rush to stock up on food. Although understandable as a means to curb the epidemic, the prime minister’s decision not to give migrant workers time to return to their home villages sowed further chaos and misery as hundreds of thousands of poor labourers with nowhere else to go struggled to cross the country despite the closure of air, rail and bus services. Thousands have ended up walking long distances. Pakistan has seen a similar flight to villages, with impoverished workers caught riding in ambulances and in the cargo holds of buses to escape the travel ban. In India as many as 500,000 truck drivers were also stranded with their vehicles, blocked from crossing state boundaries, says a research group. Ironically, the stalled deliveries have included vital medical supplies, such as parts for ventilators. ■\nDig deeper:\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus hub\nThis article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline \"Hand-to-mouth to lockdown\""}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/giving-birth-during-coronavirus-pandemic/608320/", "title": "Giving Birth During the Coronavirus Pandemic", "text": "She’s worried about shortages in her neighborhood in Brooklyn, for one thing. As people rush to batten down the hatches and stock up their homes, grocery stores are already looking barren; in the coming months, global supply-chain issues could exacerbate the problem. So Batscha, and no doubt many other soon-to-be parents, are stocking their homes with things they wouldn’t ordinarily.\n“There’s a shortage, for example, with toilet paper and paper towels—so I don’t know if there’s going to be a shortage on [maxi] pads,” Batscha said. Since bodies that have just given birth tend to bleed heavily for a few weeks afterward, she’s already placed orders online for a bunch of postpartum and super-absorbency maxi pads. Before the threat of a pandemic, she said, “I took for granted that I could just order this stuff through Amazon Prime and it would arrive the next day.”\nRead: The demystification of the postpartum female body\nShe’s also mentally fast-forwarding to the coming months of infant care—and she’s preparing for a worst-case scenario there, too. Batscha, who breastfed her first son for more than a year after he was born, has been closely monitoring authorities’ evolving advice for breastfeeding parents. At this point, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website informs readers that in the few studies that have been conducted, COVID-19 “has not been detected in breast milk; however we do not know whether mothers with COVID-19 can transmit the virus via breast milk.” Because there’s uncertainty, Batscha is planning to stock her home with baby formula, in case she gets sick. She hopes she’ll never have to use it. “Ideally, nobody has [COVID-19] in this house, and this isn’t a concern. But if something happens and we need to act very quickly,” she said, “I just want to feel as if his nutrition needs are also met if I can’t meet them.”\nBatscha has also seen all the plans she had squared away months ago for labor and delivery get thrown into jeopardy. Her hospital is an hour away, in Upper Manhattan, and because Americans have been advised to practice aggressive social distancing, she’s not sure who will be able to look after her son when she goes into labor. The original plan was for both the Batschas’ nanny and their best friends to have a key to their home and be on call. “But what if my nanny or my best friends get [the virus]? Who, then, comes to watch our son? Does my husband stay at home and I go to the hospital by myself?”\nFor now, she’s accepted that the plan could shift any day. “Every couple days, we’ll have to just be like, ‘Okay, these people are all still healthy. This is plan A, this is plan B,’” she said.\nRead: Dear Therapist’s guide to staying sane during a pandemic\nFor now, Batscha is doing her best to adapt her month-nine relaxation plans to comply with the new guidance on staying safe—for her own health, for that of her new baby, and for that of her parents, who are planning to drive up from North Carolina after the baby is born (provided everyone stays healthy). She told me she feels a little shortchanged that she hasn’t been able to spend her last month of pregnancy relaxing and seeing friends. But on the day before we spoke, she had managed to snag a moment for herself: She walked to the park during the day with her dog, where she sat on a bench, plugged her headphones into her phone, and watched Netflix shows while she ate lunch. “I felt the sun beating down on me and it just felt refreshing—to, you know, be outside, have that fresh air, and find a little bit of mental clarity.”"}, {"url": "https://news.err.ee/coronavirus-in-estonia", "title": "Coronavirus in Estonia", "text": "06.05.20 ...

Then it was in response to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, an investment bank. This time, on March 3rd, it was because of the “evolving risks to economic activity” from the coronavirus.\nThe decision to drop rates by half a point to 1-1.25% was a bold move, but it failed to reassure investors. American stockmarkets remained jittery, particularly in light of comments made by Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, at a press conference. “We do recognise that a rate cut won’t reduce the rate of infection,” he said. “It won’t fix a broken supply chain. We get that. We don’t think we have all the answers. But we do believe our action will provide a meaningful boost [for] the economy.”\nHis comments suggested the short-term outlook for economic activity was gloomy. The S&P 500 closed down 2.8%; the yield on ten-year Treasury bonds fell to just below 1%, a record low. Spreads on high-yield bonds remain elevated, indicating concerns about the financial health of some highly indebted firms.\nThe rate cut was not a complete surprise. Earlier in the day finance ministers and central-bank governors from the Group of Seven, a club of large economies, had issued a joint statement declaring that they were ready to cooperate with “timely and effective measures”. Australia had also cut rates the same day. The moves followed earlier signals by the Fed and the Bank of Japan that rate cuts might be coming, which had temporarily bolstered spirits in global stockmarkets after a hammering last week.\nWhat made the Fed’s move more remarkable, though, was that it came during the longest economic expansion in American history, with the current boom beginning in June 2009. Normally at this late stage in a growth cycle central banks push up rates to head off rising prices, but annual inflation in America was just 1.7% in January. The Fed had begun trying to tighten monetary policy back in December 2015; rates eventually reached a high of 2.25-2.5% three years later. More than half of that increase has now been reversed.\nPresident Donald Trump had been calling for the Fed to ease monetary policy but, in a tweet, indicated that he was far from satisfied with its extent. “The Federal Reserve is cutting but must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors,” he wrote.\nMr Trump may get his wish. James Knightley, chief international economist of ING, a Dutch bank, thinks the Fed may make two further quarter-point rate cuts by the end of June. Initially the main economic impact of covid-19 beyond China, where it first appeared, was disruption of supply chains of companies that are dependent on Chinese components and products. “The concern now is that the fear factor surrounding covid-19 will change corporate and consumer behaviour and lead to a demand shock as well,” Mr Knightley said. Several companies have issued warnings about the impact of the virus on their profits; corporate events, such as the Geneva motor show, have been cancelled; some firms have sent workers home to prevent the virus spreading in the workplace, which can put a further drag on business activity. The OECD, a group of mostly rich nations, lowered its global growth forecast on March 2nd to 2.4%, the slowest rise since 2009.\nIt is likely that other central banks will follow the Fed’s move. Analysts expect the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England to follow closely behind. The hope is that such actions will ease financial conditions for struggling firms, and help the world economy swiftly recover once the virus is under control. But while its spread continues to cause alarm in the population at large, rate cuts alone will not be enough to rebuild confidence in the economy.\nCorrection (March 4th 2020): An earlier version of this piece cited America’s CPI rate of inflation. The Fed targets the PCE rate, so this has been changed."}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2020/04/ardern-merkel-breed-newsom/610351/", "title": "Ardern , Merkel , Breed , Newsom : Four COVID - 19 Leaders", "text": "Angela Merkel, the German chancellor\nMerkel, a former research scientist who holds a doctorate in quantum chemistry, is “less a commander in chief and more a scientist in chief.”\n“Germany’s leader has deployed her characteristic rationality, coupled with an uncharacteristic sentimentality, to guide the country through what has thus far been a relatively successful battle against COVID-19,” the writer Saskia Miller reports in a dispatch from Berlin.\nGavin Newsom, the governor of California\nThe first-term governor’s aggressive, swift response to the outbreak appears to be paying off: Though the state is under-tested, California’s curve looks far flatter than that of New York.\nTodd S.

Her early action, then controversial, likely helped keep San Francisco’s numbers comparatively low.\n“She did the right thing at the right time, even though it’s not what people wanted to hear,” Senator Kamala Harris, one of Breed’s political mentors, told my colleague Russell Berman.\nJEREMY LEUNG\nOne question, answered:Why is COVID-19 making some people sicker than others?\nSome patients feel almost nothing, while others spend weeks in the ICU. A puzzling aspect of the new coronavirus is how varied people’s responses are.\nAt a certain point, it’s not the virus itself endangering the person. It’s their body. Jim Hamblin explains: “Once the virus has spread widely within our body, our own immune system becomes the thing that more urgently threatens to kill us.”\nOnce the body recognizes that it’s been overwhelmed by the virus, which can take a week or two, the immune response sometimes goes into overdrive. This process, known as a cytokine storm, seems to be what causes many coronavirus patients to crash.\nResearchers are looking for patterns in who survives cytokine storms and who doesn’t—and for approaches that might help control a patient’s immune response. That work is ongoing, and we don’t have the answers yet, but we do know that a person’s immune response is not isolated from societal factors.\n“Variation in immune responses between people is due to much more than age or chronic disease,” Jim writes.“People who are unable to take time off of work when sick—or who don’t have a comfortable and quiet home, or who lack access to good food and clean air—are likely to bear the burden of severe disease.”\nWhat to read if … you just want practical advice:"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/china/2020/03/14/covid-19-is-making-it-harder-to-grow-food-in-china", "title": "Planters , plagued - Covid - 19 is making it harder to grow food in China | China", "text": "NEXT TO A row of idle tractors on the edge of a field in Zhaoquanying, a village on the outskirts of Beijing, sits a row of wheat farmers. Like almost all Chinese when outdoors these days, they are wearing face masks because of the epidemic of covid-19. Their gaze is fixed on their smartphones because, they say, there is not much else to do. “The ground is still too hard,” says one. “But we’re ready to plant when the time is right.” As the weather warms, that day is imminent. It is one that they, and many government officials, have been worrying about.\nIn mid-February, at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak, some of China’s agricultural experts said it was “unclear” whether spring planting could happen on time. They worried that massive disruptions to transport caused by virus-containment measures could affect the delivery of inputs such as fertiliser on which farmers rely (see chart). They also feared that quarantine controls would prevent seasonal workers from getting to farms where their labour is needed for planting. On February 25th China’s president, Xi Jinping, and the prime minister, Li Keqiang, issued instructions on the need to “stabilise” agriculture. They called for an “all-out effort” to ensure that the epidemic did not affect the planting of vital crops.\nMuch of China’s economy shudders with uncertainty about the damage caused by covid-19. But many firms still hope they can recoup at least some of their losses. Some cancelled events will be rescheduled. Some of the cars or refrigerators that were not sold during the shutdown will be snapped up when things return to normal. Farmers, however, cannot accept any disruption. To avoid a total loss for the season, they must start their spring planting soon. At stake is not only the welfare of the 40% of China’s people who live in the countryside and depend on agriculture, but the stability of the national food supply.\nIn the two months since the outbreak began, China has already felt covid-19’s impact on supplies of some food. Restrictions on the movement of people have left labour-intensive slaughterhouses understaffed, squeezing meat production. This follows the severe damage already done to pork supplies by an outbreak of African swine fever, an animal disease that struck China in 2018 and led to the loss of 40% of China’s pigs. Pork prices have tripled since early last year.\nFertiliser freeways\nIn response to the leadership’s calls, local officials have been pulling out the stops to ensure planting proceeds. They have set up “green channels” for lorries carrying agricultural necessities so they do not get delayed at checkpoints and toll booths (tolls have been waived on all highways since February 15th). Bureaucrats have a strong incentive: promotions, they have been told, will depend on how effectively they ensure that farmers can do their work this spring. Officials have been trying to make life easier for farmers in other ways, too, such as by reducing land-use fees and directing state-owned banks to give them loans on easy terms.\nIn Zhaoquanying, together with a faint scent of manure, there is a hint of optimism in the air. The farmers say their wheat planting will go ahead as usual. In the nearby village of Hongtongying, some vegetable farmers have just taken delivery of several lorry-loads of plastic film for use on the greenhouses they erect over their fields. The shipment arrived on time from the eastern city of Hangzhou, some 1,300km (800 miles) away. Everything else they need is already in place, they say. Still missing, however, are migrant workers from other provinces, who have been held up by epidemic-related travel restrictions. “They’ll get here when they can, but until then we will manage,” says one of the men.\nRecovery will be slower in Hubei, the province hardest hit by covid-19, and that is no small matter. It is one of the country’s main sources of chemical fertiliser. Last year it produced nearly a tenth of China’s rice. But agricultural experts say most of China’s farmers are likely to muddle through the busy season ahead. The government has made clear that spring planting must be carried out without delay, says Thomas Luedi of Bain & Company, a consultancy. “They built two hospitals in about a week,” he notes, so they can probably get the grains sown on time, too. ■\nDig deeper:\n- For more coverage of covid-19 see our coronavirus hub\n- The science of the virus\n- Fatality rates for covid-19 could vary enormously\n- How to deal with a new sort of financial shock\n- Should other countries copy Italy’s nationwide lockdown?\nThis article appeared in the China section of the print edition under the headline \"The other 40%\""}, {"url": "https://news.err.ee/1061520/no-positive-coronavirus-tests-taken-from-samples-analyzed-on-sunday", "title": "No positive coronavirus tests taken from samples analyzed on Sunday", "text": "No positive coronavirus tests taken from samples analyzed on Sunday ({{contentCtrl.commentsTotal}})\nThe laboratory of the Estonian Health Board on Sunday analyzed samples taken from 18 people but detected no instances of coronavirus from said samples.\nSince January 31, the laboratory has analyzed altogether 311 COVID-19 tests, 10 of which have been positive, the Health Board said.\nSamples were only taken after potential symptoms of COVID-19 were thought to have materialized.

They lack basic infrastructure, including any level of medical care. However, they are only a 10km dinghy ride to Boigu Island, the mostly northerly island of the Torres Strait, with a population of about 300 people.\nPeople from these and 11 other PNG coastal villages along the Western Province coast are allowed to travel across the Torres Strait to visit the island communities in Australian territory under the Torres Strait Treaty to maintain traditional kinship and trading relationships.\nThey can cross without a passport or visa and there are up to 50,000 visits a year under the treaty.\nThe Torres Strait regional island council’s mayor, Fred Gela, said authorities were putting in place measures to protect the Australian mainland but the Torres Strait had been left exposed.\n“People can get in a dinghy and come straight across to the Torres Strait, and while our health centres are equipped with the capacity to test for the virus, we cannot afford the availability, time or capacity to test everyone crossing the border under the treaty.”\nResidents of all the Western Province Treaty villages regularly travel back and forth to the island of Daru, which is the region’s commercial centre and has a population of 15,000.\nThere is a hospital on Daru but it is often poorly equipped and has been identified as a hotspot for other infectious diseases spreading due to overcrowding in the island’s slums. It has some of the world’s worst infection rates of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, as well as a resurgence of leprosy due to lack of medical supplies and access to health services.\nTorres Strait Islanders are exposed to these communicable diseases by migration movement under the Torres Strait Treaty, where they are six times more likely to contact MDR TB than non-Indigenous mainland Australians.\nQueensland Health’s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, said the Torres and Cape Hospital and Health Service was well-prepared to respond to coronavirus but she did not confirm if any reports of outbreaks in PNG had been received.\nGela said the Torres Strait local disaster management group, which includes police, health authorities and border force, met last week to discuss the threat.\n“During this meeting, we flagged concerns that protection measures to prevent potential exposures taken at mainland Australian ports, via regulation of aircraft or shipping entry, has not transpired at our entry points in and around the Torres Strait,” Gela said. “This is of particular concern given our close proximity of the virus origin, being Asia.”\nThe proximity with Indonesia, with the West Papuan town of Merauke only a dinghy ride away from the Torres Strait, also posed a potential threat from Covid-19.\nCouncillors resolved to ban all travel of PNG nationals and Torres Strait Islanders under the Torres Strait Treaty and would not sign any permits allowing trade or travel between the Torres Strait and PNG until further notice, Gela said.\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Australian Border Force have not responded to requests for comment."}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/06/moscow-doctors-forced-to-self-test-risky-malaria-drug-for-coronavirus-bbc-a69877", "title": "Moscow Doctors Forced to Self - Test Risky Malaria Drug for Coronavirus – Reports", "text": "Municipal hospital doctors in Moscow are being required to test the malaria treatment drug hydroxychloroquine on themselves to see if it could prevent coronavirus, BBC Russia reported Friday.\nMore than a dozen countries are studying the coronavirus prevention and treatment effects of hydroxychloroquine, according to the Moscow study’s recently created website that invites doctors to participate.

S . Military Is Failing Us", "text": "Read: The case against waging ‘war’ on the coronavirus\nAircraft carriers, of course, are the hulking epitome of American military might; “Whenever there has been a crisis, the first question has been: ‘Where are the carriers?’” the Navy’s website proudly proclaims. The answer, during the current crisis, is that the Theodore Roosevelt is out of service in Guam, with a demoralized crew and more than 150 sailors (including, reportedly, the discharged captain) sick with COVID-19. The rules of war don’t apply here. Aircraft carriers can’t fend off disease; in fact, they’re uniquely vulnerable to it. As my colleague Kathy Gilsinan wrote, the military is struggling to protect its own people, let alone other Americans.\nThe Theodore Roosevelt cost $4.5 billion. And as Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut pointed out this week, whatever fancy aircraft carrier replaces it “will be more than our entire annual anti-pandemic budget.” (After all, it costs $400,000 just to fix clogged toilets on the country’s newest aircraft carriers.)\n“It’s not that we lack the resources to protect America from pandemic disease. It’s just that we don’t align our spending to the actual threats that America faces today,” Murphy wrote on Twitter. “Russia and China are bigger threats than ever before. We shouldn’t stand down in the fight against major powers and non-state adversaries. But are conventional military actors really 100x more dangerous than disease? The answer, of course, is staring us in the face today.” Presuming that national security is about securing the nation, it follows that national-security resources should be allocated according to what will most protect the American people.\nJust last week, on the same day that the United States exceeded 1,000 coronavirus deaths in a single day for the first time, the head of the U.S. military’s Indo-Pacific Command requested $20 billion in new funding over the next six years to counter China in the Pacific. The price tag includes advanced weaponry such as space-based radars and a “360 degree” missile-defense system “critical for defending the Homeland.” With that kind of cash, the United States could buy a whole lot of ventilators, which are in dangerously short supply at the moment.\nThat’s not to say that the U.S. must choose between space-based radars and ventilators, between guarding against the very real threat China poses to U.S. interests and girding for public-health catastrophes. But it is to say that the United States has a lot of money to play with, and can afford to allocate its resources in ways that more accurately reflect the threats facing Americans around the world. Imagine if the U.S. government had been as proactive about stockpiling medical equipment for a pandemic as it has been about, say, competing with China.\nKenny said he hopes that the Defense Department will draw on its logistical expertise to help distribute medical supplies, and that the military’s medical researchers will help develop a coronavirus vaccine and COVID-19 treatments. Still, he continued, “maybe it is time to make sure U.S. support to the World Health Organization is worth more each year than the costs of buying and operating a single F-35 fighter.”\nMaybe. But the government isn’t quite there yet. Yesterday, Trump threatened to withhold U.S. funding from the WHO. The U.S. military, meanwhile, just placed an order for 78 new F-35s, at a cost of $4.7 billion.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

In a column posted on the ministry’s website on Thursday evening, Kiuru said that Finland's public health care system could increase the numbers of tests to 7,000 per day and that private care firms could boost their testing to up to 3,000 a day.\nShe said that continuous, increased testing has been part of Finland’s strategy fighting coronavirus since the epidemic broke out in the country.\nAccording to Finland’s Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), the country had carried out a total of around 39,000 by Thursday afternoon, with about 2,500 tests having been done over the past day.\nAt the beginning of the epidemic in Finland, the country only carried out a few hundred tests per day, Kiuru wrote, and increased to about 1,700 daily tests in mid-March. In time, however, with help from private health care firms, Finland can soon increase daily testing levels to about 10,000.\nShe said that testing will focus on symptomatic medical workers, social and health care personnel with even mild symptoms, individuals critical to the functioning of society who have the slightest suspicion of infection, people belonging to coronavirus risk groups suspected of being exposed to the virus as well as relatives of those with confirmed Covid-19 infections.\nNo plans for general testing\nHowever, the minister noted there are currently no plans to carry out untargeted tests of the general population who are asymptomatic, saying such a move was not appropriate at this stage.\nKiuru also noted that there has been much discussion in the country regarding antibody testing and the role it could play in fighting the epidemic. Such sampling can determine whether people have unknowingly already had a coronavirus infection.\nEarlier this week the THL announced it would research the spread of the disease with the help of broad antibody testing.\nHowever, in her column, Kiuru said antibody testing can only be effective when there are sufficient levels of people who have the infection and when tests are reliable and widely available.\nDespite that, she said antibody testing efforts were still important because they can provide helpful information for an overall picture of the epidemic's extent. At this point, she said the antibody testing to be carried out will be for research purposes.\nShe said the planning stages of the testing, to be done in tandem by THL and university hospitals, is complete and that the selection of the study’s first test subjects - a process which is random and with the participants' consent - is underway."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-51690868", "title": "Scottish surveillance testing system for Covid - 19 begins", "text": "Scottish surveillance testing system for Covid-19 begins\nTesting of patients in Scotland with flu-like symptoms is to begin as part of measures to combat Covid-19.\nA surveillance network of 41 GP practices will submit samples, even if patients have not travelled to an area affected by the new coronavirus.\nThe plan makes use of an existing system recording the spread of flu and is described as a \"precautionary step\".\nTesting is also to be introduced for patients admitted to critical care units with pneumonia.\nThe convenor of Holyrood's education committee Clare Adamson has, meanwhile, warned parents to think about what they would do if schools had to close.\nShe said: \"If there's a significant outbreak in our area it may be that a school will have to close - maybe only for a few days for a deep clean.\n\"There may also have to be special measures put in to support pupils that are sitting exams and that might have a bigger impact on other areas of the school.\"\nChief Medical Officer Dr Catherine Calderwood said: \"Scotland is well-prepared for a significant outbreak of coronavirus but there is currently no treatment or vaccine.

At the same time, gas consumption is decreasing and private consumers are turning to alternatives.\nLast autumn, the price of natural gas fell to its lowest level in the last decade and has continued to fall since then. One of the reasons for the long-term decline in gas prices is the oversupply of gas on the world market and the unwillingness of major producers, especially the US and Russia, to reduce gas supplies. The coronavirus has also played a role in the price drop last month - Chinese companies are refusing to accept new supplies of LNG, or liquefied natural gas (LNG), which has pushed global prices for LNG to rock, according to Reuters.\nEstonia's largest and practically the only gas importer, Eesti Gaas, which imports most of its gas from Russia, does not see a big problem with the low price, but sees good news for the consumer.\nRaul Kotov, Member of the Board of Eesti Gaas, told ERR that the price of gas is influenced by the price of competing fuels, such as heavy and light fuel oil, as well as by competition between gas sellers. However, this year's warm winter in Europe and the coronavirus in Asia meant that stocks traditionally collected before winter turned out to be too high and there was an oversupply.\nHe said: \"Traditionally, gas prices have been lower in the summer months and higher in the winter due to higher winter consumption and lower summer consumption. This was also the case in 2019. At the beginning of the year the price was higher, in summer it fell and in autumn it started to rise again. However, the unexpectedly warm winter in Europe and the corona virus reduced demand in both the U.S. and Asia. If the price rose in December, then in January it has already fallen and forecasts continue for it to fall in February and March.\"\nKotov said prices are expected to rise again in November, but that gas prices should stay lower prices than in 2018-2019 for the next two to three years.\nConsumption is falling, consumers are looking for alternatives\nFor consumers, lower prices are good news. At the same time, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications said gas consumption has been declining, as shown by last year. The use of natural gas is expected to increase and be used in new areas such as district heating and transport.\nThe gas system operator Elering reported consumption in Estonia decreased by 8.6 per cent last year compared to 2018, totaling 4.8 terawatt hours. \"The reason for the decline is probably still the outdoor temperature and the partial switch from gas to biofuels in district heating,\" said Ain Köster, communications manager at Elering.\nRaul Kotov pointed out the same reasons, especially the warmer weather and that new household boilers have started to run on wood chips. District heating is an important area for gas, however, since one fifth of the gas consumed in Estonia is used there. One third is used exclusively in industry.\nHowever, Kotov does not think private customers are looking for alternative fuels. \"Individual private customers tend not to give up gas, because gas heating is the most convenient fuel - it is automated, there is no storage required, and it's clean - it is the most popular\" he said.\nKotov noted alternative solutions are more likely to be considered when there is no connection, or it is too expensive to connect to, gas.\nThe number of gas consumers has not been influenced by the accidents reported in the media which are connected to gas heating and carbon monoxide poisoning, he said.\nState policy directs people away from using gas\nAs gas is not part of renewable energy, its consumption is also affected by the national energy policy.\nFor example, heat pumps may be preferred in new residential areas because they have \"certain advantages due to the new minimum requirements for energy efficiency,\" Kotov said.\n\"Even with new developments, gas heating will continue to be the prefered choice, provided district heating does not limit it. But real estate developers' preferences are increasingly influenced by climate policy. However, since you cannot rely solely on solar or wind power in Estonia, we can see the future with combined solutions such as solar plus gas,\" Kotov said.\nEstonia's energy policy favors renewable fuels, which means that the use of natural gas for district heating has decreased year by year, while it is still needed to cover peak loads, especially during cold weather or winter, and as a reserve fuel.\nHowever, in industry, natural gas continues to be important, even indispensable, because it offers greater flexibility in managing industrial processes while being both environmentally sustainable and economically sound, Kotov noted.\n\"So we are moderately optimistic about the gas usage of industrial companies and we see growth opportunities. Instead, the amount of natural gas consumed in the future depends on how local industry as a whole is doing, whether it will survive in competition with other countries,\" he said.\nOne area where the use of natural gas is on the rise is in the transport sector, which is increasingly becoming biomethane. Estonian biomethane is used in both public and freight transport.\nKotov said three biomethane production complexes are expected to be added to Eesti Gaas this year and production will double compared to last year. However, this does not mean natural gas will quietly disappear from the market.\n\"Natural gas will not disappear from road transport, as biomethane production requires time-consuming investments, and natural gas is available at all times. Natural gas is like a bridge in the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources and the natural gas infrastructure plays a very important role here, including in the development of hydrogen technology,\" Kotov said.\nAccording to Kotov, natural gas has great potential for growth in the shipping industry as there are an increasing number of LNG-powered vessels.\n--\nDownload the ERR News app for Android and iOS now and never miss an update!\nEditor: Helen Wright"}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-columbia-university-cancel-classes-55b80729-a2dc-49e0-94f7-23d4ce7a0ca8.html", "title": "Coronavirus : Columbia University latest school to cancel classes", "text": "Coronavirus: Columbia University the latest to cancel in-person classes\nColumbia University's Low Memorial Library in New York City.

Iran, the regional epicenter of the virus, has been fighting one of the world’s worst outbreaks.\nAs Israel’s case count rose to over 6,800, including 34 deaths, the country was rattled by the diagnosis of its health minister, who has had frequent contact with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nThe Middle East has confirmed over 82,000 cases of the virus and over 3,600 deaths, most of them in Iran. Iran’s Health Ministry said Thursday that the new coronavirus killed another 124 people, pushing the country’s death toll to 3,160.\nLarijani, a former Revolutionary Guard commander who enjoys close relations to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has led Iran’s legislative body since 2008. Over the years he has held various positions in the top ranks of Iran’s government, including head of state television, minister of culture and secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, which helps set foreign and defense policy. A number of his family members also hold top government positions.\nIn a rare acknowledgment of the severity of the outbreak, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the coronavirus may remain through the end of the Iranian year, which just began late last month, state TV reported Thursday.\n“We always have to follow the health protocols provided by the health ministry,” Rouhani added.\nIn Lebanon, the Philippines ambassador, Bernardita Catalla, died of complications from the virus Thursday, the Philippines said.

But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia that can be fatal.\nIn war-torn Syria, the government extended the closures of mosques until April 16, nearly a week before the start of the holy month of Ramadan. It also expanded curfew times over the weekend and indefinitely extended a ban on visits to prisons, citing concerns over the spread of the virus.\nRights groups have called on governments across the Mideast to release thousands of political detainees held in crammed and unhygienic jails. In government-controlled Syria, 16 cases of infection and two deaths were reported, although limited disease surveillance systems have bred concern that the virus may be spreading further.\nAs a further containment measure, Syrian government announced it would isolate Sayyida Zeinab, a southern suburb of the capital, Damascus, which houses one of the holiest Shiite shrines. The heavily guarded site draws thousands of Iranian and Iraqi pilgrims and has been closed to visitors since March in precaution against the virus.\nThe World Health Organization said it was increasing preparedness in the rebel-controlled, northwestern region of Syria, which is home to 4 million people and extremely vulnerable to contagion. The war has destroyed or closed half of all health facilities, and hundreds of thousands of people who fled war and repeated government offensives have been crowded into displacement camps.\nMeanwhile, with countries closing borders to slow the spread of the virus, the aviation industry’s largest trade association warned the pandemic is expected to wipe out $23 billion in passenger revenue from airlines across the Middle East and Africa this year.\nThe International Air Transport Association said Mideast airlines will see a $19 billion drop in revenue this year, compared to 2019. Airlines in Africa, including EgyptAir, are expected to see a $4 billion drop. Hundreds of thousands of job in the aviation sector are also at risk across both regions.\nSaudi Arabia’s revenue loss could exceed $5.6 billion this year, with pilgrimage flights on hold in addition to commercial air traffic. The United Arab Emirates, home to world’s busiest airport for international travel in Dubai, is projected to lose $5.4 billion in revenue.\nEgypt and Qatar could also see more than $1 billion each in revenue loss, while the aviation sector in South Africa is expected to lose $2.3 billion in potential revenue.\nIATA said projections are based on assumptions that travel restrictions will continue through the second quarter of 2020.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

But she is also battling cancer, reports BBC Hindi’s Sushila Singh.\nEvery morning, 46-year-old Rama Sahu leaves her home in the eastern state of Orissa to conduct door-to-door surveys and distribute rations.\nShe walks in sweltering heat - the average summer temperature in Orissa touches 40C - to visit 201 households.\nShe encounters the same faces every day but none of them know that she has been diagnosed with uterine cancer. Her condition is so bad that she wears a diaper throughout her rounds.\n\"When I work, I forget all my problems,” she says. “The mind is always at work.”\nShe questions families to find out if any one of them is showing symptoms of Covid-19, advises them on isolation and social distancing norms, and distributes food. She patiently answers their questions and enters information into her form.\nThis form is then submitted to local officials, who collate this data across districts every day to monitor trends and document cases in a country as vast and densely populated as India.\n- India doctors 'spat at and attacked'\n- India's race against time to save doctors\n- The underpaid and unprotected women leading the Covid-19 war\nThe country currently has close to 50,000 reported infections, but many believe the low number is because India is not testing enough. So, the role of frontline health workers like Ms Sahu, who are constantly on the lookout for new cases, has become all the more important.\nThere are hundreds of thousands of such workers across India. And amid a strict nationwide lockdown, which began on 25 March, they are also delivering rations to the poor, and giving them much needed advice on dealing with the pandemic.\n“We are needed in these trying times,” says Ms Sahu.\nAnd that’s why, she adds, she continues to do her job even though she is battling a painful disease.\n\"She stays at home only when she is in a lot of pain,” says her husband, Ramesh.\n“She cries a lot at home but she forgets all of that while she is working,” he adds. “But her supervisors are understanding, and ask her to take leave and rest.”\nThe couple had two sons, but both of them died. One was four years old, and the other just six months.\n“Our world came crashing down,” Mr Sahu recalls. He says they both fell ill but he doesn’t know what the illness was.\nHe says he and his wife wanted to become parents again but it was while they were trying - in 2014 - that she received her cancer diagnosis.\nMr Sahu owns a convenience store. He used to work on construction sites in another state but moved back home after that.\nHe says that they went all the way to Mumbai city for treatment and started chemotherapy. She was told that she had recovered but soon after, the cancer returned.\n\"The doctor told us that nothing is in his hands because the cancer is in the last stage,” he says.\nMs Sahu, meanwhile, is undeterred. She says it’s her job to educate people about the use of masks, and how to wash their hands. Otherwise, they will “mess it up”, she says.\n“Even though she is ill, she has not backed down.

It is only fitting, then, that they would mobilise for what China has termed a “people’s war” against covid-19. Moutai has donated 114m yuan ($16m). Others have gone further, setting up sidelines in medical disinfectant made with 75% ethanol. Amid an acute shortage of antivirus gear, the state is handing out production licences.\nLast month Li Keqiang, China’s prime minister, urged firms to boost supplies of protective kit for medical workers by expanding or converting production lines. Yibin Guomei Liquor, a baijiu distiller from Sichuan province, had already swung into action. By February 4th a sister company that makes ethanol was sending sanitiser to its baijiu workshops for bottling and packaging. Two assembly lines now produce 250,000 bottles of disinfectant a day.\nYibin Guomei’s first 2m bottles were sold (at a loss) to the local government, which distributed one to each home in Yibin. The next batch went to the fire brigade, traffic police and other departments. The next lot was distributed nationwide—at full price. Liao Maolan, who helps run Yibin Guomei, expects subsidies. The firm is already drawing up plans for a permanent disinfectant-packaging workshop.\nIt is not just booze businesses that are retooling. An affiliate of GEM, a battery recycler, is producing sanitiser. BYD, a maker of electric cars, aims to churn out 50,000 bottles of disinfectant and 5m masks a day—a quarter of China’s usual capacity. Shaanxi Automobile Group, which builds lorries, is producing goggles. So is Xingchi Hengdong, a division of China South Industries Group, an armsmaker (it normally 3D-prints spacecraft parts). Daddy Baby, a nappy producer, has gone into masks.\nAll told, over 10,000 companies have added masks, hazmat suits, thermometers and the like to their product lines in the past two months, estimates Tianyancha, a data firm. Thomas Luedi of Bain, a consultancy, says weak demand during the outbreak spurred factories to redeploy workers to make vital goods. Licence in hand, Yibin Guomei called back labourers on their spring-festival break. Making masks and disinfectant is “not awfully complicated”, Mr Luedi adds.\nFirms are also producing antivirus kit for their own use, in order to meet new workplace standards. Yibin Guomei is scrubbing its baijiu factories with its disinfectant. Foxconn, a contract manufacturer that assembles iPhones, is making masks for its 1m-plus employees. State-owned enterprises have been commandeered to produce and donate much-needed supplies. For market-oriented firms, the sooner covid-19 is contained, the sooner they can get back to business, notes Mr Luedi. Most expect a surge in orders because of pent-up demand, and will quickly return assembly lines to their original purpose.\nThe government has assured virus-fighting firms that it will buy leftover stock. It has also directed state banks to grant cheap loans to those making crucial equipment. Xiaomi, a smartphone-maker, is among those seeking a 5bn-yuan loan to make thermometers and other gear, according to Reuters. Authorities have already reportedly caught some 50 state-owned borrowers masquerading, literally, as makers of face masks and such.■\nDig deeper:\n- For more coverage of covid-19 see our coronavirus hub\n- The science of the virus\n- Fatality rates for covid-19 could vary enormously\n- How to deal with a new sort of financial shock\n- Should other countries copy Italy’s nationwide lockdown?\nThis article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline \"The anti-covid industrial complex\""}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/confessions-of-an-urban-prepper-11584744556", "title": "Confessions of an Urban Prepper", "text": "- Opinion\n- Commentary\n- Cross Country\nConfessions of an Urban Prepper\nI’m a New York City lawyer, but coronavirus has brought out the Kentucky survivalist in me.\nBrooklyn, NY\nA friend showed up to my apartment recently bearing not wine but a bottle of 99% isopropyl alcohol.

Gilbert had been dead for some time, and authorities learned he had returned to Boise on Feb. 5 after traveling to India and China. His trip included stops in Shanghai-Pudong and Shenzen, China, according to the coroner’s office.\nBecause of the circumstances, health authorities tested Gilbert’s remains for coronavirus and influenza. Initial tests for both viruses came back negative, Owens said.\n“However due to the condition of the decedent and in an abundance of caution, additional tests are being requested through the CDC,” Owens wrote in a prepared statement. Those additional tests will take up to 10 days, and Owens said the results will be released when they are available.\nOwens said the police and other workers who responded to the death have taken all possible safety and protective measures. No other cases of suspected coronavirus have been reported to her office, she said.\nTens of thousands of cases of the illness known as COVID-19 have been reported globally, most of them in China. U.S. officials on Thursday announced the country’s 15th confirmed case of the new coronavirus, in an evacuee from China who had been under quarantine in Texas.\nThe virus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia.

Here a Key Number . ", "text": "Finally, the test-positivity rate has become much more reliable nationwide over the past few weeks. As recently as the end of March, not all states reported every negative test result from commercial laboratories. Nearly every state now publishes those numbers.\nRead: Why we’re running out of masks\nWhile our numbers still probably do not capture every coronavirus test in the U.S., outside evidence now suggests that our data are fairly complete. When the White House Coronavirus Task Force has reported the number of tests completed nationwide, its numbers have broadly matched the COVID Tracking Project’s. In addition, the largest commercial-test processors, Quest and LabCorp, have released top-line statistics that align with ours at the COVID Tracking Project.\nThe high positivity rate also suggests that new cases in the U.S. have plateaued only because the country has hit a ceiling in its testing capacity. Looking solely at positives, the U.S. is steaming toward 650,000 confirmed cases, but the number of new cases per day appears to be plateauing or even declining.\nThere are several ways to interpret this development. It might suggest, for instance, that the more than 3.2 million tests completed in the U.S. over the past two months have finally captured a good chunk of the people who are actually infected. While it’s clear that the country is not capturing every case, this decline in new positive cases might suggest the country has started to get the virus’s spread under control.\nBut there is another way to interpret the decline in new cases: The growth in the number of new tests completed per day has also plateaued. Since April 1, the country has tested roughly 145,000 people every day with no steady upward trajectory. The growth in the number of new cases per day, and the growth in the number of new tests per day, are very tightly correlated.\nThis tight correlation suggests that if the United States were testing more people, we would probably still be seeing an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. And combined with the high test-positivity rate, it suggests that the reservoir of unknown, uncounted cases of COVID-19 across the country is still very large.\nEach of those uncounted cases is a small tragedy and a microcosm of all the ways the U.S. testing infrastructure is still failing. When Sarah Pavis, a 36-year-old engineer in New York, woke up on Tuesday, she was out of breath and her heart was racing. An hour of deep breathing failed to calm her pulse. When her extremities started tingling, she called 911. It was her ninth day of COVID-19 symptoms.\nRead: My whole household has COVID-19\nNew York City’s positivity rate is an astonishing 55 percent. More than 111,000 of the city’s residents have lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19, but Pavis is not among them. When the ambulance arrived at Pavis’s apartment, an EMS worker took her vitals, then explained there was little he could do to help. The city’s hospitals only admitted people with a blood-oxygen level of 94 percent or lower, he said. Pavis’s blood-oxygen reading was 96 percent. That 2 percent difference meant that her illness was not serious enough to merit hospitalization, not serious enough to be tested, not serious enough to be counted.\n* This article previously used an incorrect epidemiological term to describe the number of cases of a disease in a population.

That work has taught us how to read the different types of numbers that are trickling out of local, state, and federal agencies. The project has been able to track just over 8,000 people tested in the United States, where there are more than 1,000 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Our number, too, is imperfect, but it allows us to better understand the scale of the country’s response to this pandemic.\nThese numbers, if anything, are an undercount, the magnitude of which is unknown. The extremely limited testing capacity of the U.S., combined with restrictive testing criteria, has curtailed the number of people who should be tested. How dramatic is the undercount? One analysis from Cedars-Sinai suggested that 9,000 people had the virus already on March 1.

For those who are in contact with a suspected case in a childcare or educational setting, no restrictions or special control measures are required while laboratory test results for Covid-19 are awaited.\n“There is no need to close the setting or send other learners or staff home. Therefore, until the outcome of test results is known, there is no action that staff members need to take. People who test negative for Covid-19 will be advised individually about their return to education.”\nShe said it was helpful for schools to approach the virus like any other infectious disease. “Therefore, it is not advised that the whole school is notified that an individual is undergoing testing. Rather, communications to contacts would be circulated if a case is confirmed,” she added.\nSo far, 3,000 people have been tested for the disease in the UK and there have been nine confirmed cases.\nIf a child is suspected of having contracted the disease, it is their parents’ responsibility to inform the school that the child is staying off in order to get tested or because the child needs to self-isolate, the spokeswoman added.\nThe local health protection team would only inform the school directly when a child is confirmed to have the virus. “If a case is confirmed, then the local health protection team would speak to the headteacher and action would be taken from there,” she said.\nSchools affected by coronavirus outbreaks in their area have been given bespoke advice by the authorities.\nAt some schools in Brighton and Hove, the majority of parents are choosing to keep their children at home, after receiving letters from headteachers warning that someone connected with their schools had been asked to undergo testing or had self-isolated due to the coronavirus. They are being told that such absences will be authorised by the school, an unusual step that the fresh guidance makes clear is not necessary.\nNick Brook, the deputy general secretary of NAHT, the school leaders’ union, said: “Our best advice to school leaders is to encourage them to stay on top of the continually updated advice from the government, share it with pupils and their families, and act accordingly.\n“We have been signposting this advice to members. Schools will be particularly mindful to take care of the emotional needs of international students who are unable to travel home during the half-term break.”\nGeoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The advice and guidance which has been issued is sensible and proportionate.

We’re seeing the dissemination of material claiming that immigrants spread coronavirus, and that authoritarian regimes outperform western liberal democracies in tackling the health crisis.”\nZinc Network said British far-right groups such as Britain First and the Knights Templar International, as well as the BNP’s former leader, Nick Griffin, have used the crisis to promote themselves as supporters of the community during the lockdown. Griffin has posted images of himself on social media distributing food parcels.\nZinc Network, which in the past has attracted scrutiny for its work promoting the Home Office’s anti-radicalisation strategy, Prevent, studied social media posts, photos, videos, journals, official records and media reports to produce the analysis.\nIt said one key narrative being pushed by the far right is that the spread of coronavirus is the consequence of illegal immigration. Allied to this is the claim that nations with tightly-controlled borders are better prepared to deal with the pandemic. Another is the premise that modern liberal states are on the verge of collapse, and that their fall can be accelerated through armed action or by a major crisis.\nThe promotion of survivalist material by far-right groups is also becoming a trend. Zinc says neo-Nazi publisher Arktos has been publishing updated and expanded editions of far-right survivalist texts.\nA favoured tactic among far-right groups is to put fake documents into circulation, designed to look like real medical or government communications. According to Zinc’s monitoring, far-right Telegram channels have been instrumental in circulating a fake scan of a positive Covid-19 test for the former vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\nThe same channels have also been distributing government pandemic response documents with a view to helping would-be attackers plan their actions.\nSome far-right organisations are using the crisis to impersonate other groups, Zinc claims. Fake Extinction Rebellion flyers have been found in several cities in the UK proclaiming “Corona is the cure – humans are the disease”.\nMost of the leaflets condemn immigration, with some calling for the public to “learn about the JQ” – the “Jewish question”. Others promote conspiracy theories or deny the Russian novichok attack in Salisbury.\nBrooke said: “These extremist groups are using the coronavirus as an opportunity to further their ideological objectives by spreading fear and division and exacerbating social tensions.”"}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-toyko-2020-olympic-organizers-insist-games-will-go-on/a-52364457", "title": "Coronavirus : Toyko 2020 Olympic organizers insist Games will go on | Sports| German football and major international sports news | DW", "text": "Local organizers of the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics have again pledged that the Games will go ahead as planned.

In Russia, the RTS index has dropped 21% in recent weeks, pushed lower as oil prices fell to near $50 a barrel. The ruble has also weakened by around 5% against the U.S. dollar.\nAfter opening with strong gains in morning trading, stock markets in Russia and Europe lost momentum as the day progressed, leaving them still well below levels recorded before last week’s rout.\nLower oil prices put pressure on the Russian state budget, which relies on oil exports for a significant portion of its income, just as President Vladimir Putin plans to increase spending in a bid to improve Russians’ sluggish living standards.\nRussia’s economic development minister Maxim Reshetnikov also warned Monday that the impact of the coronavirus on the Russian economy will be worse than originally expected.\nThe 0.4 percentage point reduction in the 2020 forecast for Russia was slightly better than the world economy as a whole, as the Paris-based economists slashed their prediction for global growth this year from 2.9% to 2.4%. It now predicts China, which has seen the vast majority of coronavirus cases and deaths, will record its lowest annual expansion in three decades at 4.9%.\nThe OECD said: “The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has already brought considerable human suffering and major economic disruption. Governments need to act swiftly and forcefully to overcome the coronavirus and its economic impact.”\nSummarizing the economic effects of the disease so far, the report added: “The adverse consequences of these developments for other countries are significant, including the direct disruption to global supply chains, weaker final demand for imported goods and services, and the wider regional declines in international tourism and business travel.”\nComparing the impact of the coronavirus with the 2003 SARS outbreak, the OECD said that “the global economy has become substantially more interconnected, and China plays a far greater role in global output, trade, tourism and commodity markets.”\n“This magnifies the economic spillovers to other countries from an adverse shock in China. Even if the peak of the outbreak proves short lived, with a gradual recovery in output and demand over the next few months, it will still exert a substantial drag on global growth in 2020.”\nIn a Monday research note, VTB Capital’s Neil MacKinnon said: “The coronavirus has happened at a time when the global GDP growth cycle was already in a downgrade and when world trade has slumped.

But on the apps I use to meet other men, like Grindr and Scruff, the order didn’t seem to mean much: My neighbors in San Francisco were cruising for hookups.\nBy Thursday on Scruff at least 100 men were still online. On Grindr there were 111 people available within six miles. In my inbox: an invitation to a group-sex party.\nThat same day, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordered the state to shelter in place. Yet the apps still remain open for business.\nEric Silverberg, C.E.O. of Perry Street Software, which owns Scruff and a similar app, Jack’d, told me this week that he currently has “no intention” of closing either. “Queer social apps offer critical emotional support for our community as well as conversation,” he said, adding that over 60 percent of their users report using Scruff primarily to chat, with only 23 percent exclusively looking to hook up.\nScruff and Jack’d are peppering their apps with public-safety announcements promoting hand-washing and keeping a safe distance from people showing symptoms. But as we know, people can transmit the virus while showing no symptoms at all. And not everyone believes the science anyway. When I asked a man who messaged me on Grindr why he wanted to meet up, given that the C.D.C. advises extreme social distancing, he responded: “I don’t believe in this. I don’t believe the media.” Then he blocked me.\nIt’s not just some gay men who refuse to prioritize communal safety over fun. Far from it.\nThis past weekend, before the state of Florida finally broke up the party, college students on spring break flocked to the beaches there. A young man in Miami told a CBS reporter: “If I get corona, I get corona. At the end of the day, I’m not going to let it stop me from partying.” As of Friday, Florida had reported 520 cases of the coronavirus and 10 deaths.\nTinder is very much online, even as it directs users to W.H.O. guidelines. Grindr is doing something similar. When I reached out to the company this week, a representative told me, “We are advising users to follow guidelines provided by the C.D.C. and have published these guidelines in the Grindr app to help users make the best-informed decisions when interacting with others.”\nBut can we really afford to rely on horny people forced to stay at home all day to “make the best-informed decisions” about everyone else’s health? History — and my Grindr inbox — tells us no.\nI don’t think the apps should be shut down. Mr. Silverberg is right: They give people in my world an opportunity to connect socially, not just physically. But everyone needs to cooperate to halt the spread of a deadly virus. That is something that gay men should understand in our bones.\nSo why don’t some of us? Partly because those who could be counted on to sound the alarm are no longer here, wiped out by the AIDS pandemic. Partly because gay men are generally not the people raising the next generation of gay men. Our history isn’t taught in schools, and it isn’t something we learn from our families. If we want to learn our history, it’s on us to seek it out. Sitting on my couch looking at these apps ping on my phone, I can’t stop thinking about what a tragic irony it would be to see those who survived the AIDS pandemic succumb to Covid-19 because we ignored that hard-learned lesson.\nSaying no to sex right now doesn’t make you the Nancy Reagan of the Covid-19 era. It means keeping everyone safe and healthy in the present, so that we can continue our future face-to-face fun.\nNow seems the perfect time to bring back good old-fashioned phone sex. Or if you’re blessed with flattering lighting in your quarantine bunker, use the camera.\nAnother option is to download Sniffies, a gay hookup app that has explicitly urged its users not to hook up. “We felt the current messaging around social distancing has failed to include casual dating and sex,” said the app’s C.E.O., Blake Gallagher. “And we didn’t feel that the overall messaging from the community of dating apps was strong enough — telling people to just wash their hands for 20 seconds between hookups is clearly not going to cut it.”\nI responded to the invitation to an orgy this week, saying: “No thank you. I’m going to heed the recommendations of the C.D.C. to help stop the spread of this virus.” The reply: “Trusting the C.D.C. is hot.”\nPhilip Dawkins is a playwright whose works include “Charm” and “The Homosexuals.”\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/03/12/throughout-history-pandemics-have-had-profound-economic-effects", "title": "Free exchange - Throughout history , pandemics have had profound economic effects | Finance and economics", "text": "PANDEMICS ARE the inevitable attendants of economic progress. Interconnected trade networks and teeming cities have made societies both richer and more vulnerable, from the empires of antiquity to the integrated global economy of the present. The effects of covid-19 will be very different from those of past pathogens, which struck populations far poorer than people today, and with less knowledge of things like viruses and bacteria. The toll should be on a different scale than that exacted by the Black Death or Spanish flu. Even so, the ravages of the past offer some guide as to how the global economy may change as a result of the coronavirus.\nThough the human costs of pandemics are dreadful, the long-run economic effects are not always so. The Black Death carried off an astounding one-third to two-thirds of the population of Europe, leaving lasting scars. But in the wake of the plague there was far more arable acreage than workers to farm it. The sudden scarcity of workers raised labourers’ bargaining power relative to landlords and contributed to the breakdown of the feudal economy.\nIt seems also to have ushered parts of north-west Europe onto a more promising growth path. Real incomes of European workers rose sharply following the pandemic, which struck the continent from 1347 to 1351. In pre-industrial times, higher incomes usually enabled faster population growth, which eventually squeezed incomes back to subsistence levels (as observed by Thomas Malthus). But in parts of Europe, Malthusian rules did not reassert themselves after the pandemic receded. Nico Voigtländer, of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Hans-Joachim Voth, now of the University of Zurich, argue that the high incomes induced by plague led to more spending on manufactured goods produced in cities, and thus to higher rates of urbanisation. The plague effectively shoved parts of Europe from a low-wage, less urbanised equilibrium on a path more congenial to the development of a commercial, and then an industrial, economy.\nSomething similar occurred in the aftermath of the Spanish flu, which killed between 20m and 100m people from 1918 to 1920. The industrial economies of the early 20th century were no longer bound by Malthusian constraints. Even so, reckon Elizabeth Brainerd, now at Brandeis University, and Mark Siegler, of California State University, American states harder hit by the disease grew faster in its aftermath. After controlling for a range of economic and demographic factors, they find that one additional death per thousand people was associated with an increase in average annual growth of real income per person over the next decade of at least 0.15 percentage points. Though the toll of covid-19 is likely to be too low to boost real wages, it may force firms to embrace new technologies in order to operate while warehouses and offices are empty, with lasting effects on growth and productivity.\nMore often, though, a pandemic’s economic consequences are unambiguously negative. Trade links which spread a pathogen can themselves be undone by its effects. During the Roman Empire, a high degree of specialisation and trade lifted incomes to levels that would not be reached again for more than a millennium. Alas, the same links facilitated the spread of disease. The Roman economy was dealt a blow in the late second century AD, when an outbreak of what is thought to have been smallpox ravaged the empire. A century later, the Plague of Cyprian, which may have been a haemorrhagic fever, emptied many Roman cities and coincided with a sharp and permanent decline in economic activity, as measured by numbers of shipwrecks (a proxy for trade volumes) and levels of lead pollution (generated by mining activity). Reduced trade fed a cycle of falling incomes and weakened state capacity from which the western empire never recovered.\nMore recently, trade may well have tumbled as a result of Spanish flu, had the first world war not already brought a curtain down on the industrialised world’s first great era of globalisation. Covid-19 also strikes at what may be the tail end of a long period of rapid global integration, which is likewise threatened by great-power competition. The circumstances are not identical, and trade is unlikely to suffer as badly as it did in the 1910s. Still, it would not be surprising if historians identify the pandemic as one of several consequences of globalisation that eventually precipitated a new era in global trade.\nJust as pandemics have a way of demarcating historical eras, they can also pinpoint shifts in the fortunes of some places relative to others. The Black Death lifted real incomes across Europe. But the fortunes of Europeans subsequently diverged, and disease again played a role. Plague returned to the continent in the 17th century in several deadly waves. The effects of these outbreaks varied greatly across Europe, argues Guido Alfani, of Bocconi University in Milan. Though at most a tenth of the population of England and Wales was lost to plague, for example, more than 40% of Italians may have died from the disease over the course of the century. While Italy’s population stagnated and rates of urbanisation tumbled, north-west Europe continued to benefit from growth and urbanisation despite the pandemic. The fiscal capacity of Italian states suffered badly, as did the textile industries of northern Italy, and northern and southern Europe embarked on quite different economic trajectories.\nDisease is not destiny\nIn the battle against covid-19, countries’ fates are in their own hands to a far greater degree than in the pre-industrial past. Governments know much more about how epidemics can be managed. Different experiences with the disease are as much an indicator of underlying state capacity as a cause of future economic divergence. Still, history reveals how pandemics nudge societies listing in one direction or another in a decisive and consequential direction. We cannot know what long-run effects covid-19 may have, but we can feel reasonably sure there will be some.■\nThis article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline \"The ravages of time\""}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/curb-your-enthusiasm-on-gilead-11587136706", "title": "Curb Your Enthusiasm on Gilead", "text": "- Markets\n- Heard on the Street\nCurb Your Enthusiasm on Gilead\nBuying stocks on anecdotal Covid-19 patient data is a bad idea\nA viable treatment for Covid-19 is desperately needed, but investors are way too enthusiastic about the latest potential breakthrough.\nStat News reported Thursday that a subset of Covid-19 patients receiving the drug remdesivir had improved.

A project overseen by the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China, the forthcoming hardback is billed as a tribute to President Xi Jinping’s “outstanding leadership” in the fight against the novel coronavirus. With Mr Xi already dubbed “Commander of the People’s War” against covid-19 by official media, it would be a bold party committee or government office that does not order a copy. Yet those eager to reserve one in advance will need patience, because the volume has suddenly vanished from the online catalogues of the People’s Publishing House. When the book returns in some guise, as it doubtless will, the contents may have changed quite a bit. For propaganda chiefs need to rethink their rhetoric about covid-19, since they cannot hope to live up to it.\nSince January hundreds of millions of Chinese have spent weeks in locked-down villages and towns, forbidden to meet friends and family. Some have had to home-school children. Others are living on savings until their workplaces re-open. Scanning social media for news, many normally apolitical citizens have been angered by reports of official cover-ups and incompetence, or by viral smartphone videos of security forces thuggishly enforcing quarantines. The same citizens have then been shocked to see controversial reports deleted before their eyes by censors.\nAnxious to rally a frightened public, Chinese leaders declared all-out war on the devil virus some weeks ago. It will end, they promise, with “a complete win”. State and party news outlets have cast doctors and nurses as “white-clad and fearless warriors”. Medics killed by the virus have been hailed as battlefield martyrs.\nThough China has nothing resembling a free press, some more independent voices can be heard, whether bloggers or a few big-city, commercially driven news outlets that push the limits of what may be reported. The epidemic has seen notably brave work by Caixin, a business publication whose commercial backers include Tencent, a technology giant, and which is said to have high-ranking fans, among them (it is rumoured) Wang Qishan, China’s vice-president and a former anti-corruption chief. The publication has sent several teams to Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. They reported that officials hushed up news of tests conducted in December that first discovered the new virus and then suppressed evidence that it could jump from human to human. Editorials in Caixin have argued that transparency is the key to winning public trust, because suppressing the truth fuels panic.\nCaixin’s reports have been repeatedly deleted by censors. For all that, and a bit unexpectedly, its calls to level with the public also earn praise from some in the party press. That may be because greater honesty is the only way out of the trap created by early, hubristic promises of total victory. Back on February 20th, when almost all confirmed cases of covid-19 were inside the country’s borders, the China Daily boasted, “Were it not for the unique institutional advantages of the Chinese system, the world might be battling a devastating pandemic.” Now the virus has been detected in more than 70 countries, and—in the past few days—travellers have been found returning to China with infections picked up abroad. This virus is going to be around for a long time, perhaps forever. Someone will have to break that to the Chinese public.\nHu Xijin is editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a bombastic tabloid under the People’s Daily, the party’s official mouthpiece. Mr Hu notes that his own paper’s reports exposed instances of bungling by Wuhan officials. But he concedes that Caixin’s “performance on the investigative front really stood out”. Caixin’s work gives state media cause for “self-reflection”, he adds: the government press “should have played a supervising role” when city, provincial and national health officials made mistakes at the start of the outbreak.\nAsked how he thinks Caixin got away with its limit-testing reporting during this crisis, Mr Hu describes a mysterious process by which Chinese media outlets sense the political currents of the day and try to align their work with “what society needs” at that moment, as he puts it. Enter the current at the right time and success can follow, he explains. “If sometimes you miss, the results might be very different.”\nA provocateur who relishes explaining to Western reporters how wrong they are, Mr Hu is serene about the challenge of admitting that virus outbreaks may continue long after China eases strict quarantine rules. “If we need to change strategy, we can change any time,” the editor says, venturing that the Chinese are practical, want to go back to work and live in a country with better virus controls than “high-risk” France, Germany, Italy or South Korea. “They want to be rid of the virus. But if it can’t be defeated, we need to accept that too.”\nWhen in doubt, lash out\nTrue to nationalistic form, in recent days the Global Times has accused Western nations of failing to learn from China’s resolute policies, as the world prepares for a “protracted war” against the virus. Tut-tutting about the cost of health care in America, the tabloid asked, “If a superpower fails to control covid-19 simply because many people cannot afford treatment, then can that country really be great again?”\nChina’s top leaders are more subtle about their blame-sharing, but still at pains to note that virus-control is now a collective, global challenge. Meeting scientists on March 2nd Mr Xi talked of “humanity’s battle against diseases” and of the tasks facing all mankind. Such language is not as stirring as books about China single-handedly saving the world. But right now the task is selling something short of total victory to a frightened Chinese public, many of whom distrust official assurances about public health. Blaming the world is a good start. ■\nThis article appeared in the China section of the print edition under the headline \"Total incredulity\""}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/retailers-and-fashion-brands-prepare-for-empty-shelves-as-coronavirus-crisis-hits-supplies-0jljvkccx", "title": "Stores fear empty shelves as coronavirus hits supplies", "text": "Stores fear empty shelves as coronavirus hits supplies\nHigh street retailers and fashion brands are bracing themselves for stock shortages because of the coronavirus outbreak.\nHalfords, Primark, B&M, Asos and DFS could be affected in the coming weeks as factory closures persist across China.

The civil protection chief said that more than 400 people who tested positive are mildly ill or not sick at all while isolated at home.\n“The aim is to return to normalcy,″ Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia told Italian state TV, in an interview, noting that 79 of the 133 people in his region with the virus “have no symptoms and are in perfect health.”\nMeanwhile, other countries made a different diagnosis. Since Thursday night, cases with links to Italy were reported in Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, United Arab Emirates, Greece, France and Nigeria - the first known case in sub-Saharan Africa.\nIn all, 24 cases have been exported from Italy to 14 countries, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom said. Later Friday, the list grew to 15 countries when Iceland said a one of its nationals who had traveled to Italy tested positive after returning home.\nWhile Italy was looking to lift outbreak-related restrictions, other European countries suspended activities and events in an attempt to control the virus’ spread.\nItaly’s neighbor, Switzerland, Friday banned all public events involving more than 1,000 people until March 15, including the annual Geneva International Motor Show. Montenegro suspended flights to and from Bologna and Milan.\nAn Italian Civil Protection statement listed 888 cases in 13 regions and one autonomous province by Friday night.\nAmong the new cases was a woman with mild symptoms from Fiumicino, a suburb of Rome on the outskirts of Leonardo da Vinci airport, health officials said. She is the Rome area’s first case, not counting two Chinese tourists who took ill while staying in a hotel a few weeks ago.\nThe woman, who was placed under quarantine along with her close contacts wastested positive on Friday, had recently been in Bergamo, a city in Lombardy, officials said.\nThe number of deaths of people with the virus increased to 21. All of the people who died were elderly, already seriously ill or both, and Civil Protection chief Angelo Borrelli noted that it hadn’t been yet determined if all those deaths were actually caused by the virus.\nFrance saw case totals suddenly jump to 57, prompting authorities to test a raft of people, limit some public activities and try to determine the source of the latest infections. Most are concentrated in the Oise region north of Paris, where a teacher with the virus died this week.\nSpain also saw an uptick, raising the national tally to 34 by Friday, with all but a handful linked to Italy’s outbreak. Germany has reported 53 cases.\nThe public health authority in the southern Dutch province of Limburg, which borders Germany, advised local authorities to cancel public events at which Dutch and German residents mix “because of the exponential growth in the number of corona infections just over the border.”\nLeading Italian medical authorities insisted that the transmission rate should be steeply slowed before schools in heavily involved regions like Lombardy could resume classes.\n“It’s not an easy situation,” said Dr. Massimo Galli, a top official at Milan’s Sacco Hospital. “Let’s forget about thinking it can be easily resolved, even though it’s not popular to say that.”\nGalli said health authorities are aiming to reduce the current rate of transmission of about 2.6 cases from each infected person to less than one.\nThe European Center for Disease Prevention and Control put the risk of case clusters like Italy’s cropping up in other countries at “moderate to high.” If that happens, the infected stricken areas can expect a significant impact, “especially if hospitals were affected and a large number of healthcare workers had to be isolated,” the health agency said.\n“The rigorous public health measures that were implemented immediately after identifying the Italian COVID-19 cases will reduce but not exclude the probability of further spread.,” it said.\nBut as Italians yearned for a return to their daily routines, schools, museums, shops and other public places appeared likely to stay closed for another week.\n“We are asking people to make some sacrifice for a few more days,” based on scientific advice, Lombardy health official Giulio Gallera told reporters Friday evening.\nMore than inconvenience was at stake. Italy, with its long stagnant economy, risks a recession the longer the quarantines and other containment measures drag on factory production, tourism and other industries. Lombardy and Veneto are key industrial and agricultural areas, and include tourist popular cities such as Venice and Milan.\nPremier Giuseppe Conte’s Cabinet was meeting Friday evening to approve “urgent measures of support for families, workers and businesses” affected by the public health emergency, his office said.\nResearchers at Milan’s Sacco Hospital announced that they had isolated in four patients an Italian variation of COVID-19, with differences from the strain identified in Wuhan, China, where the epidemic began. They expressed hope the discovery could lead to more targeted treatment of patients.\nResearch suggests the virus might have been present for some time in Italy before cases started exploding in Lombardy. “The virus has been circulating under the radar for a few weeks,” Galli, the hospital’s director of biomedical and clinical services, told state TV.\nCulture Minister Dario Franceschini said that among the most suffering economic sectors were hotels, which have been forced to return reservation deposits.\n“They are experiencing a liquidity problem,″ said Franceschini, adding that cancellations were running as high as 90% in some places, including many locations without infections.\n“I’m about to lose everything if it continues like this,” said Emanuela Soppelsa, who owns the 60-guest Hotel Al Parco near Moena in an Italian ski resort area. She told The AP that 60 Polish skiers had cancelled their March 7-14 booking.\n___\nFrank Jordans in Berlin, Mike Corder in The Hague, Angela Charlton in Paris, John Rise in Mexico City, Aritz Parra in Madrid, Danica Kirka in London and Maria Grazia Murru in Rome contributed.\n____\nFollow AP’s coverage of the new coronavirus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51599009", "title": "Coronavirus : Russia denies spreading US conspiracy on social media", "text": "Coronavirus: Russia denies spreading US conspiracy on social media\nRussia has flatly denied allegations that it is spreading disinformation about the new coronavirus outbreak on social media.\nUS officials said Russian-linked accounts were making unfounded claims that America started the outbreak.\nThousands of profiles on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram were peddling the theory, the officials said.\nResponding to the allegations on Saturday, the Russian foreign ministry dismissed them as \"fake\".\n\"This is a deliberately false story,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Russia's Tass news agency.\n- Coronavirus cases double in one day in South Korea\n- Coronavirus: What you need to know\n- Russian media hint at US coronavirus conspiracy\nOver 2,000 people have died, mostly in China, and more than 76,000 people are confirmed to have the new coronavirus.\nThe virus, which originated last year in Hubei province in China, causes a respiratory disease called Covid-19.\nEarlier, a senior US State Department official, Philip Reeker, said \"malign\" Russian actors were attempting to sow disinformation about the origin of the coronavirus.\nOne conspiracy theory - circulating online in several languages - alleges the virus is an attempt to wage \"economic war on China\".\n\"By spreading disinformation about coronavirus, Russian malign actors are once again choosing to threaten public safety by distracting from the global health response,\" Phillip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia, told AFP news agency.\nThe posts also accused Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates of involvement in the outbreak.\nAccording to AFP news agency, the disinformation campaign was identified by US monitors in mid-January, shortly after the third death from the new coronavirus was announced.\n\"In this case, we were able to see their full disinformation ecosystem in effect, including state TV, proxy web sites and thousands of false social media personas all pushing the same themes,\" said Lea Gabrielle, the head of the State Department's Global Engagement Centre.\nThe accounts had been previously identified for sharing Russian-backed messages on events such as demonstrations in Chile and the war in Syria.

She first tested positive for coronavirus in late January and was discharged from hospital on 1 February after recovering. She tested negative again on 6 February.\nIt is possible, say experts, that when the woman was released, she had not cleared the virus. But if so, that means it lingered dormant in her body longer than the 14-day quarantine period. She will have been in contact with more people than have been traced, which poses worrying questions about the length of time people should be isolated after a positive test.\nAlternatively, she may have been wrongly diagnosed with Covid-19 the first time round. But nobody is ruling out the possibility of reinfection. Once the immune system has fought off viral or bacterial infections, it generally recognises them and can block them the next time they are encountered – but not always and the protection may not last.\nThere have been reports of a few cases of reinfection in China, but doctors will hope it occurs in just a very few individuals, if at all.\nAfter more than 82,000 cases of Covid-19, the unknowns still outnumber the knowns. Although there is clearly human-to-human transmission, we don’t know whether that happens only through droplets from coughs or sneezes or whether there are other forms of transmission as well. There have been reports of airborne transmission in China, although the World Health Organization (WHO) says it is generally not happening.\nHowever, the infection of large numbers of people onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner, which did not end after people were told to remain in their cabins, still needs explanation. Prof David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and an adviser to the WHO, said there could be faecal or oral transmission as well.\nSewage was implicated in the cluster of Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) cases in the Amoy Gardens apartment block, in Hong Kong, in March 2003, when more than 300 people were infected. Sars, also a coronavirus, spread through the building’s plumbing system.\nHeymann says the transmissibility of the coronavirus is still uncertain. “It is not know how transmissible this is in the community,” he said. All we know for certain is that it can be passed among groups in a small room, such as in families and in the German seminar room where several attendees were infected.\n“There have been some cases in China and other places where they have just popped up without the possibility of being able to trace back to a source,” he said. Investigations in Italy are looking for some sort of mass event that could have led to the clusters of cases found in northern cities.\nWhile we know there is asymptomatic transmission from somebody with the new coronavirus who is not ill, we do not know how extensive that is. Some people, known as “super-spreaders”, are more efficient transmitters of viruses than others.\nThe WHO says we still need more information about the severity of the disease. In China, where the vast majority of cases and deaths have so far occurred, we know that 81% of people have had only mild illness. Of the rest, 14% have severe disease, which may become pneumonia, and 5% have critical disease involving breathing problems and organ failure.\nThe death rate has been estimated at between 2 and 4% in Wuhan, where the epidemic began, but only 0.7% in the rest of China. But we still do not know how many people are not being counted in these statistics, because they suffer only a sore throat and do not go to hospital.\nIt is clear that those people with damaged or failing immune systems are most at risk. “Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable,” says the WHO. But we do not know why children, who are very susceptible to some diseases, do not seem to be much affected by Covid-19.\nWe do not know whether any of the antiviral drugs in existence will help people recover – some, including anti-HIV/Aids drugs, are being given to patients as part of trials in China. We are probably at least 18 months away from knowing whether there can be an effective vaccine against Covid-19.\nAnd we don’t know where and how this all began. Scientists understand from the the genetic sequencing of the virus that it came from animals, as did the other problematic coronaviruses, Sars and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Because of a cluster of early cases linked to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, which sold and slaughtered live animals for food, most believe the likely source to be wild animals. The similarity of the virus to Sars suggests a bat origin, but there would have been an intermediary animal carrying the virus, which could have been civet cats, bamboo rats or – as one Chinese university has claimed – pangolins.\nThe earliest recorded case of Covid-19 was in someone who had no link to the market, raising questions about this theory, but it is not possible to be sure that patient was the first, not least because of the large proportion of people with mild illness."}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/children-asymptomatic-carriers-coronavirus-440fe0f5-b11d-41dc-968e-9e85a8955d1c.html", "title": "CDC : Asymptomatic children could play important role in coronavirus spread", "text": "CDC: Asymptomatic children could play important role in coronavirus spread\nA 3-year-old wraps up a bike ride during the coronavirus outbreak on Monday, Washington, D.C.

And poor ones, who are also suffering from capital flight, are crying out for cash. The IMF, the world’s crisis lender, is already parcelling out loans. It may yet resort to a weirder weapon: the special drawing right (SDR), an arcane financial instrument designed in the 1960s. At present, some 204bn SDRs sit on the balance-sheets of finance ministries and central banks around the world. Each can, in theory, be swapped for currency worth $1.36. Governments in poor countries desperately need cash to retain investors’ confidence, pay off creditors and buy medical supplies. Some economists think an infusion of SDRs is part of the answer. Could this help tackle the corona-crisis?\nWhen SDRs were introduced in 1969 they were intended to reduce the world’s dependence on dollars. At the time many of the world’s countries pegged their currencies to the greenback, which was itself tied to gold, under the so-called “Bretton Woods” system of fixed exchange rates. But the two components were in tension with one another. When too few dollars circulated in the world economy, perhaps as a result of America spending less on imports, countries would hoard greenbacks to defend their pegs, and global commerce ground to a halt. But creating enough dollars to satisfy the global demand for reserves imperilled the credibility of the dollar’s peg to gold. Providing an alternative reserve asset, it was thought, might provide an escape from this dilemma.\nThe idea was reminiscent of “bancor”, a global currency proposed by John Maynard Keynes in 1941. Like bancor, SDRs aim to share the so-called “seigniorage” benefits that accrue to America as a result of providing the world’s currency. To reinforce their balance-sheets with dollars, countries must, in aggregate, sell goods and services to America and hold on to the proceeds. But when SDRs are issued, everyone gets reserves without having to provide anything in return. Reserves fall like manna from heaven, rather than emerging from trade flows.\nYet SDRs failed to take off. The need for them became less pressing after America untethered the dollar from gold in 1971. And too few were issued. Keynes had proposed that the stock of bancors would grow in line with world trade. But political wrangling means that there have been only three allocations of SDRs, the most recent of which was in 2009. They make up less than 3% of non-gold reserves; by contrast, the dollar makes up over half.\nAs a source of liquidity, though, SDRs have their advantages. They are not a true currency, as they can be exchanged only between IMF members and not in private markets. Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California, Berkeley—and a former chief economist at the fund—sees them as a way to share risk. Countries are given SDRs in proportion to their IMF “quotas”, which determine their financial commitment to the fund and their voting rights. When they face a liquidity crunch, they can offer cash-rich countries SDRs in exchange for hard currency. They must pay interest, currently at a rate of 0.05%, on the amount of their SDRs they choose to convert, making exchanging an SDR a bit like drawing on an emergency overdraft—one that does not need to be repaid.\nAre SDRs an appropriate crisis-fighting tool? The IMF reports that several poorer countries have called for it, and that members are discussing the idea. Rich countries are offering their citizens wads of cash with very few strings attached, say supporters. Why shouldn’t the IMF do the same for the world’s governments? Some economists want a huge allocation of SDRs, worth $4trn.\nThere are several hurdles in the way and these could take months to overcome. Most important, America is reluctant to issue any SDRs at all, let alone $4trn-worth. Its opposition stems from a belief that theIMF should not be printing money (when converted, SDRs increase the amount of cash in circulation). And, like other countries, it also dislikes the idea of handouts that come with so few strings attached. What if the financial lifeline allowed countries to slacken the pace of reforms, or made life easier for Iran? The IMF is supposed to support governments facing temporary liquidity problems, but also to insist on restructuring any debts that are unsustainable. An SDR allocation is described as liquidity support by its advocates, but it could help an otherwise insolvent country pay off its creditors. America’s opposition matters. Issuing SDRs worth more than $648bn would require approval from its Congress. Even a smaller issuance would require 85% of votes at the IMF. Uncle Sam, with a 16.5% share, has a veto.\nOthers point out that securing an SDR allocation would mean spending too much political capital for too little gain. Two-thirds would go to rich countries or those with plenty of reserves. In 2009 183bn SDRs were issued to help fight the global financial crisis. But Ousmène Mandeng of Economics Advisory, a consultancy, finds that emerging markets (excluding China and members of the European Union) swapped just 1.9bn for cash in 2009-10.\nEvery little helps\nHowever, SDRs do not have to be used to be useful. Their very presence on balance-sheets frees up dollars. And though the sums involved might be too small to matter to many countries, the share of a $500bn issuance flowing to the likes of Liberia or South Sudan would be worth 7-8% of GDP, says Sergi Lanau of the Institute of International Finance, an industry group. With global demand collapsing and the world scrambling for dollars, now is not the time to dwell on the question of whether countries face solvency or liquidity crises. Poor countries just need help, fast. It is worth taking some risks to make sure they get it.\nIt is perhaps no surprise that America has doubts about an instrument first designed to reduce the dollar’s dominance. Keynes proposed bancor just after sterling lost its sway. It might take the emergence of a serious challenger to the dollar’s crown before America sees the appeal of the SDR.\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus tracker and story hub\nThis article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline \"Special delivery\""}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-pandemic-national-defense-591d3262-d8b0-456b-8e43-d8ab2d0978b4.html", "title": "The national defense establishment failed to prepare for the coronavirus", "text": "National defense has a pandemic gap\nUSS Theodore Roosevelt.

There has been much talk lately of bankers enjoying a similar rehabilitation. Reckless overextension by lenders was the root cause of the financial crisis of 2007-09. This time the blame lies with a microbe, not moneymen, and banks are seen as potentially part of the solution, not least as conduits for massive state support for stricken firms and households.\nThe corona-crisis does indeed give banks a chance to improve their image. But it also presents them with some painful dilemmas and, worse, may ravage their bottom lines. Michael Corbat, boss of Citigroup, has warned that banks like his have to tread a “fine line” between supporting clients and undermining financial stability. They must conserve capital while also keeping dividend-dependent investors sweet. However they handle such choices, the risk of hefty losses looms: bank shares have fallen by twice as much as the stockmarket this year on fears of rising defaults.\nThe industry went into the crunch in decent shape. Capital cushions, depleted going into the last crisis, have since been plumped up. Banks have also been made less vulnerable to funding runs. This time the system has creaked but not buckled. Early evidence suggests that post-2009 efforts to push liquidity risk from banks into capital markets have worked, and to the extent that risk has rebounded it has been largely absorbed by central banks through their market-support programmes, not by commercial banks, says Huw van Steenis of UBS, a Swiss lender.\nUnder those schemes, and their own steam, banks have increased lending dramatically, especially in America (see chart). In March public companies there drew down $191bn from bank credit lines, after taking next to nothing in January and February. The odd one out is China, where loan growth is similar to last year’s rate. In 2008-09 officials arm-twisted lenders into leading stimulus efforts. They may fear that another such push could break them. Chinese banks’ assets have ballooned to 285% of GDP, from 195% in 2007.\nTo encourage banks to lend more and offer forbearance, regulators in the West have rushed to relax or delay rules brought in after the financial crisis. These cover everything from loan-loss accounting to the thickness of capital buffers (see chart). By one estimate, such (presumably temporary) regulatory forbearance has created $5trn of lending capacity.\nAt the same time, regulators in Europe in particular have nudged or ordered banks to bolster their defences by freezing payouts to shareholders and star performers. British banks, for instance, are withholding £8bn-worth ($9.9bn) of dividends. American ones have not followed suit, though they have suspended share buy-backs. Bonuses are in regulators’ cross-hairs too: Andrea Enria, the European Central Bank’s top bank supervisor, has called for “extreme moderation”.\nFor now, the threat to banks does not look existential. “Unlike 2008, it’s primarily an earnings issue, not a balance-sheet one,” says Nathan Stovall of S&P Global Market Intelligence, a data provider. If charge-offs are similar to back then, American banks’ capital ratios would remain above their levels after recapitalisation in 2008-09.\nBut with major economies at a near-halt for an indeterminate period, loan losses could be bigger this time. Analysts cannot seem to downgrade bank-earnings forecasts quickly enough. Some now think American banks, which made combined profits of $230bn last year, could slip into loss in 2020. Investment banking won’t ride to the rescue. Equity issuance and corporate dealmaking have sagged (though debt-raising remains strong in pockets). Trading volumes and profits have leapt, as they often do early in a crisis, but are expected to fall dramatically.\nEurope is in worse shape. A senior banker says the outlook for British lenders is “really shitty”. He fears some smaller banks and non-bank providers may not survive. Italian lenders, battered by the euro-crisis, were on the mend until covid-19, having cut their bad loans in half, but now look precarious again. Deutsche Bank, which has been struggling to get back to good health for years, risks a relapse.\nIn China, the shock to growth will push banks beyond the limits of what regulators had anticipated. In 2019 the central bank stress-tested the resilience of 30 banks in a variety of scenarios. In the most extreme hit to the economy envisaged—growth slowing to 4.15%—it said 17 of 30 banks would need more capital. The World Bank expects growth this year to be just 2.3%. S&P has estimated—based on assumed growth of 4.4%—that the bad-loan ratio could climb to nearly 8%, a quadrupling from its pre-virus level. The questionable-loan ratio could hit an eye-watering 13%.\nThe growing worry in the West is that the short-lockdown, quick-snapback scenario proves too rosy. Several more months of restrictions could mean years of losses on soured loans. Bankers may start to find that there is a fine line between forbearance and forgiveness: in America calls for credit-card interest to be waived indefinitely are growing louder.\nUltra-low interest rates set by central banks to fight the pandemic are another headwind. An important factor in a bank’s profits is its “net interest margin” (NIM)—the difference between the rate at which it makes loans and that at which it remunerates the deposits it has gathered. Even before the corona-crisis this was a scrawny 3.3% for American banks. With policy rates likely to stay on the floor until well after the pandemic has abated, NIMs will remain emaciated for years.\nWhether banks end up drowning in red ink, or merely spattered with it, depends on a host of unknowns. “The tail event is no vaccine in a year,” says Sir Paul Tucker, chair of the Systemic Risk Council, a group of former policymakers. “Banks need to be stressed against such scenarios, as post-crisis capital requirements were not calibrated against anything like that.”\nIn a letter on April 6th Jamie Dimon, boss of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), assured shareholders the bank could comfortably withstand an extreme (“and, we hope, unlikely”) scenario, in which GDP falls by 35% and unemployment hits 14%, emerging with capital above the safe minimum. JPM is the strongest, most profitable of the world’s big banks. Others, faced with such a storm, could find themselves in trouble. ■\nDig deeper:\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus tracker and story hub\nThis article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline \"This time we’re different\""}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-aeris-environmental-notified-by-si/brief-aeris-environmental-notified-by-singapore-nea-that-aeris-active-approved-for-covid-19-idUSFWN2AH0IR", "title": "BRIEF - Aeris Environmental Notified By Singapore NEA That Aeris Active Approved For COVID - 19", "text": "Feb 18 (Reuters) - Aeris Environmental Ltd:\n* NOTIFIED BY SINGAPORE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY THAT AERIS ACTIVE ADDED TO APPROVED GENERAL PRODUCTS FOR COVID-19 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:"}, {"url": "https://news.err.ee/1084915/one-person-dies-from-coronavirus-since-friday-morning-5-new-cases", "title": "One person dies from coronavirus since Friday morning , 5 new cases", "text": "One person dies from coronavirus since Friday morning, 5 new cases ({{contentCtrl.commentsTotal}})\nOne person has died from COVID-19 coronavirus since Friday morning, ERR's online news in Estonian reports.\nCOVID-19 figures for 24 hours to morning of Saturday, May 2 in brief:\n- Four new COVID-19 cases identified, 0.7 percent of those tested.\n- One person died, an 82-year-old man, being treated at Pärnu Hospital.\n- 74 people are currently hospitalized in relation to the virus, one more than reported on Sunday.\n- 244 people have been discharged from hospital to date, 256 people have recovered from the virus.\n- Seven patients are currently on ventilators.\n- 697 COVID-19 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours.\n- 53 people in Estonia have died from the virus to date.\n- 54,464 primary tests have been performed in Estonia since the end of January, of which 1,699 (3.1 percent) have turned out positive.\nSource: Health Board (Terviseamet).\nMore detailed statistics are here.\nDownload the ERR News app for Android and iOS now and never miss an update!\nEditor: Andrew Whyte"}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/stt_partial_lifting_of_restrictions_on_libraries_under_consideration/11333006", "title": "STT : Partial lifting of restrictions on libraries under consideration", "text": "STT: Partial lifting of restrictions on libraries under consideration\nThe government will discuss a proposal allowing libraries to begin loaning books again at a meeting on Sunday.\nThe STT news agency reported on Saturday that a partial lifting of restrictions on libraries will be announced after the government’s coalition partners meet on Sunday.\nOne government source told STT that the new measures will allow libraries to begin loaning out books again, as the Ministry of Education and Culture has received a number of requests from Finnish citizens to allow libraries to perform this function.\n\"The library is an important institution in terms of crisis resilience,\" the source told STT.\nLibraries across Finland have attempted to continue to serve customers despite the Covid-19 restrictions.\nIf a decision is made to partially lift restrictions, the source believes it is unlikely libraries will begin operations again immediately, but rather management and staff will need time to make the necessary arrangements.\nRestrictions on events at libraries will, according to the source, remain in place.\nThe government will also discuss the lifting of restrictions on museums at the meeting, which begins on Sunday morning at the House of the Estates in Helsinki and is expected to continue throughout the day.\nA proposal that museums reopen but with a strict limit on the number of people who can enter at any one time will be discussed."}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/how-does-testing-for-the-coronavirus-work/a-52633616", "title": "How does testing for the coronavirus work ? | Science| In - depth reporting on science and technology | DW", "text": "Who should be tested for the coronavirus — and how? Here's what you need to know about being tested for COVID-19, and what testing may look like in the future.\nThere are no drugs or vaccines for the new coronavirus. It will take at least 18 to 24 months before an appropriate vaccine can be developed, tested for side effects in all test phases, approved by the health authorities, and then produced in large quantities and delivered globally. And then people will have to be vaccinated.\nAs such, reliable tests in the coming months are the most sensible measure to at least slow the further spread of the virus. Tests can be used to identify infected people and possible \"hot spots.\" This is the only way to quarantine those infected — whether in a medical facility or, in the case of a mild course, isolated at home.\nHowever, even in well-developed countries, medical facilities and laboratories quickly reach the limits of their capacity during an acute wave of infection. For this reason, rapid tests must be limited to genuinely suspicious cases; a general test of all is neither possible nor useful.\nWho is tested?\nAccording to current estimates, simply being in a risk area is not enough to justify a test. And not everyone with a cold or cough is infected with COVID-19 immediately.\nHowever, anyone who shows signs of virus-induced pneumonia of \"unclear cause,\" anyone who shows conspicuous symptoms such as coughing, fever and shortness of breath and who has also either had contact with an infected person or has stayed in a particularly affected risk region is a justified suspect case.\nUltimately, it is at the discretion of the doctor whether a coronavirus test is carried out or not. According to the Robert Koch Institute, random samples of patients with flu symptoms are also tested for the novel coronavirus.\nIn Germany, the costs (approximately €200 or $220) are covered by health insurance companies, but only if the patient is actually classified as a suspected case by the doctor.\nSouth Korea has set up \"corona drive-ins\" for tests in several cities\nHow is the test carried out?\nIn most cases, the test involves taking a throat swab or a throat-nose swab from the patient. The Robert Koch Institute also recommends that, in the case of a well-founded suspicion, samples should not only be taken from the upper airways but also from the lower airways, for example from coughing up secretions from the bronchi or lungs.\nWhat happens with the samples?\nThe samples are tested for coronavirus in diagnostic laboratories. The procedure is based on a so-called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Such tests take about five hours and have become standard procedures in laboratories. They are also used to clarify hereditary diseases or to determine paternity.\nIn PCR, a specifically selected piece of DNA is copied and multiplied in a thermocycler in order to search for specific DNA pieces, such as coronavirus. The method then shows whether and how many pathogens are present in the body. In viral infections, this is called the \"viral load.\"\nHow to inform those affected?\nThe actual test takes about five hours, plus the transport time to the test laboratory. The results are usually available after one or two days, after which the doctor informs the patients.\nIf the test result is positive, the patient and the respective health authority are informed immediately. If necessary, this is followed by inpatient admission with specially designed isolation rooms and protective measures.\nIn the case of mild disease progression, patients can also remain at home in isolation as long as it is ensured that they cannot infect third parties.\nEven a negative test does not completely exclude a possible infection with the coronavirus\nAre the tests clear?\nThe tests are, but even a negative test does not completely rule out a possible coronavirus infection.\nWhy? If the samples were taken incorrectly, if the samples were transported incorrectly or if the samples were taken at the wrong time, a negative result can be obtained incorrectly. This is another reason why presumably infected patients are tested several times.\nAre there also simpler and faster test options?\nAs described, diagnosis using polymerase chain reaction requires very special laboratory equipment and highly qualified technicians, which are not available in many parts of the world. Even in well-developed China, laboratory capacities were quickly exhausted due to the large number of cases. In Europe and the US, too, there are sometimes delivery problems with tests, individual test components or medical equipment.\nAfter the tragic Ebola and Zika crises, researchers have wanted to develop a portable version of these molecular diagnostic devices in order to be able to test people in less well-equipped clinics or at some point decentralized in their home country or at home.\nResearch is being carried out worldwide and the first promising approaches for a simplified rapid test, similar to a blood sugar test, are already available. For example, the test presented by China's National Health Commission will be able to detect immunoglobulins, the antibodies that the human body first produces in a new infection, by testing a drop of blood in just 15 minutes.\nDuke-NUS Medical School in Singapore has developed a similar antibody test, which has already been successfully tested by the Singapore Ministry of Health.\nDW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

The disease generally becomes infectious upon the emergence of symptoms; however, knowledge about this remains limited.\"\nChildren and pregnant women are infected just like others, but children usually have mild symptoms and pregnant women have the same clinical signs as others.\nCurrently, no serious complications have been observed in babies when the mother has had COVID-19 during her pregnancy. Similarly, the transmission of the disease to breast milk has not been observed.\nOlder people and people with chronic illnesses, who are more likely to have severe forms of disease and higher mortality rates, are at risk.\nThe main symptoms of coronavirus infection are fever, dry cough and fatigue, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. At present, approximately 80 percent of cases, including cases of pneumonia, have been mild to moderate. 14 percent of cases were serious cases and six percent were critically ill.\nThose returning from the risk area have to monitor their health for 14 days and stay at home\nPeople who have a reasonable suspicion of coronavirus infection should call their family doctor or family doctor's advice line at 1220. Emergency numbers 112 should be called in the event of a deterioration in health. You should not go to the emergency room.\nCoronavirus should be suspected if the person has been in the risk area for the last 14 days or has been in close contact with COVID-19 and has symptoms characteristic of the disease. Otherwise, it may be a flu or a flu-like virus that is widespread in Estonia.\nIn addition to avoiding close contact with people who have symptoms of respiratory illness, adherence to hygiene rules, which include proper and constant washing of hands, helps prevent infectious diseases.\nBased on the recommendations of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), as of March 11, the People's Republic of China, Italy, Iran and South Korea have been identified by the Health Authority as high-risk areas for coronavirus.\nMedium risk areas are Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria), France (Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, Grand Est, Hauts-de-France, Ile-de-France), Tyrol ski resorts in Austria, Spain (Madrid, Catalonia and the Basque Country), Japan and Singapore.\n--\nDownload the ERR News app for Android and iOS now and never miss an update!\nEditor: Helen Wright"}, {"url": "https://news.err.ee/1073140/timeline-how-saaremaa-became-the-epicenter-of-estonia-s-covid-19-outbreak", "title": "Timeline : How Saaremaa became the epicenter of Estonia COVID - 19 outbreak", "text": "Timeline: How Saaremaa became the epicenter of Estonia's COVID-19 outbreak ({{contentCtrl.commentsTotal}})\nSaaremaa has become the epicenter of Estonia's coronavirus outbreak after overtaking Harju County as the region with the highest amount of cases.

As more testing is done, the data will continue to be examined as data accumulates, according to THL research manager Arto Palmu.\nThe tests are voluntary, but Palmu encouraged those who are invited to participate so the data can be used to help experts and decision makers move forward in combatting the epidemic.\nThe very low proportion of positive antibody test results might lead some to believe the restrictions put in place to reduce the spread of the disease may have been excessive, but virology professor at the University of Turku, Ilkka Julkunen, said he didn’t think that is the case.\n\"My view is that the task of the healthcare system is to try to avoid morbidity, whatever the disease,\" he said, adding that in terms of the general public disease should always be avoided.\n\"It is not inevitable that everyone will get a coronavirus infection at some point,\" he said, pointing out that measures like social distancing and good hand hygiene have proven to be effective in Finland.\nHe said the results of those measures are what they were meant to do - curb the spread of the disease across the country.\n\"We can congratulate ourselves about the fact that those measures have been more effective than originally thought,\" Julkunen said.\nHe noted that the goal of preventing the spread of the illness while also gradually opening up society are not contradictory efforts."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51538711", "title": "Australia coronavirus : More than 200 flown home after 14 - day quarantine", "text": "Coronavirus: More than 200 Australians flown home after 14-day quarantine\nMore than 200 Australians have been flown back home after 14 days in quarantine on remote Christmas Island amid coronavirus fears.\nThey were evacuated from China's Hubei province - the epicentre of the deadly outbreak - on 3 February.\nWith no cases reported during the minimum required time, they were taken to six cities across Australia.\nMany of the returnees, including children, expressed relief, saying they were happy to be finally home.\nMore than 70,600 people across China have been infected by the virus, with 1,771 deaths.

By April 12th, according to official statistics, more than 6,000 people had died. This is over a quarter of all deaths in the whole country. There is some cause for hope: new reported covid-19 cases and deaths in the city both appear to be falling. Modelling by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a research group at the University of Washington, suggests that New York state’s covid-19 epidemic may have passed its peak.\nBut when the final death toll is reported, it may be bigger than current data would suggest. A recent report from WNYC and The Gothamist, two New York media outlets, notes that the city’s official covid-19 fatality statistics have until recently excluded those who died in their homes, and therefore were never diagnosed with the virus. Exactly how many people are missing from the tally is unclear. One clue comes from the number of people calling 911 about cardiac arrests, a known consequence of covid-19.\nAccording to data from the city’s fire department, New Yorkers are making four times as many emergency calls about cardiac arrests as they did last year. The most recent figures show that about 200 of these heart-attack victims are being pronounced dead at the scene each day, up from around 30 this time last year (see chart). It is plausible that some of these people were not victims of covid-19. Had hospitals not been so overwhelmed, they might otherwise have sought care early enough in person at emergency rooms, when they had their first symptoms, before things got bad enough to call an ambulance. Even so, the figures suggest that New York City (and possibly other places) may be drastically underestimating the number of people killed by the novel coronavirus.\nThe city has since announced that it will revise its covid-19 death count to include people who are likely to have died from the disease but who were never formally tested. Mortality statistics from governments tend to be reported with a significant time-lag.

That’s not enough for people who want to shoot down the entire country.” Over the weekend, both Ingraham and Levin circulated aFederalistarticle headlined “Why Severe Social Distancing Might Actually Result In More Coronavirus Deaths.” On April 1, Beck urged policy makers to “start putting hard dates on some of these [social-distancing] measures because we have got to get back to work … A forced economic recession isn’t a gamble that I signed up for.”\nLimbaugh, Ingraham, Levin, and Beck haven’t criticized Trump personally for acknowledging the severity of the pandemic. But neither are they giving credence to his newly dire estimates of the COVID-19 threat. The reason may be that they have different incentives than he does. Conservative talkers answer to their conservative audience, which, according to polls, remains more skeptical than Democrats of government restrictions on movement. Trump must worry about public opinion as a whole, which strongly favors government-imposed social distancing. Trump’s decision to abandon his goal of reopening the country by Easter, according to Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman of theTimes, came after “political advisers described for him polling that showed that voters overwhelmingly preferred to keep containment measures in place over sending people back to work prematurely.”\nTrump must also balance his habitual suspicion of government experts against the fact that Americans trust those experts—in particular, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci—far more than they trust himin the battle againstCOVID-19. For Trump to reject their advice entirely might hurt his own standing, especially among the Democrats and independents who have helped boost his approval rating since the virus hit America’s shores.\nConservative talk radio, by contrast, is built on distrust of experts. Left-wing populists attack economic elites; right-wing populists attack cultural elites, especially those whom progressives venerate. In recent years, as progressives have championed the scientific consensus that climate change poses a grave danger, many conservatives have come to see scientists as yet another collection of snobs using the veneer of expertise to impose its liberal ideology on the country. A 2019 Pew Research Center poll found that while a large majority of Democrats believed that scientists were better than other people “at making good policy decisions about scientific issues,” a large majority of Republicans disagreed.\nOver the past week, this populist distrust of scientific experts has suffused conservative talk radio’s downplaying of the COVID-19 threat. “The ‘experts’ are routinely wrong on issues big and small—on wearing masks, on reusable grocery bags … virus modeling and treatments,” Ingraham tweeted on April 3. “So when experts issue edicts, remember their often spectacular record of failure.” On April 1, Beck urged politicians “to stop relying on flawed modeling data to make these decisions” and instead “listen to the people in your local communities.” On April 5, Levin warned that “the media, ‘experts,’ and Democrats are trying to make it impossible for the president to even consider rational options for opening parts of the economy.” On April 3, Ingraham declared, “The ‘experts’ aren’t capable of thinking beyond the virus to an even worse death spiral affecting millions of lives here and abroad.”"}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/business/the-coronavirus-outbreak-is-putting-pressure-on-china-on-many-levels-wpzrcn5mf", "title": "The coronavirus outbreak is putting pressure on China on many levels", "text": "The coronavirus outbreak is putting pressure on China on many levels\nNeither China nor the world were well placed at the start of this year to absorb large demand and supply shocks simultaneously.

Additional studies could follow if researchers find that products approved for other uses, or even ones they discarded, show promise in their labs tackling the virus.\n“You’re seeing the industry wheel into action,” says Jeremy Levin, chairman of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization trade group and chief executive of Ovid Therapeutics Inc.\nThe development process will be slow, however. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said it would take at least 12 months to 18 months to know if a vaccine is safe and effective. Industry officials agree that the time horizon for any indication of the drugs’ effects is months away. And in drug development, most therapies fail before reaching the market.\nBattling the unknown\nAs of now, there aren’t any drugs or vaccines approved for Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus. Industry and academic researchers ramped up their discovery efforts in January, after scientists in China provided the virus’s genetic sequence.\nAt least 35 potential vaccines are under development by companies or academic researchers, according to the World Health Organization. And more than 40 life-sciences companies have virus-related projects, including drugs, diagnostics and vaccines, Dr. Levin says. There are nearly 400 global clinical trials related to the coronavirus under way, many of them evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines and therapies, according to the WHO.\nThe newness of the virus is complicating research efforts. Researchers face the challenge of properly designing trials in a short period for a relatively unknown virus, industry officials and analysts say. That makes it harder to determine what measurements will indicate a patient’s response to a therapy, says Yaron Werber, an analyst at Cowen Inc. Already, finding patients eligible to undergo testing hamstrung one trial in China.\n“We’re trying to run large randomized studies in a very quick period in a disease that we barely understand,” says Michael Yee, an analyst at Jefferies LLC.\nInovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. plans to begin testing its experimental vaccine in healthy volunteers next month and publish its human clinical-trial data this fall. Healthy volunteers in the Seattle area have begun enrolling in a trial testing Moderna Inc.’s experimental vaccine. The program has moved relatively quickly, though federal health officials have cautioned that real-world use of the shots remains more than a year away.\nEmergent BioSolutions Inc. said Wednesday it is trying to develop treatments, one of which would be derived from the blood of coronavirus patients who have recovered from the disease.\n“Everyone recognizes that a vaccine will really not be available for the next year to year and a half, and the quickest path to a product that is going to provide some benefit is some type of therapeutic product,” Chief Executive Robert Kramer said in an interview.\nLooking to the old\nSome of the most advanced programs are exploring whether drugs discovered for other uses might be effective treatments for Covid-19. Among them: an antiviral therapy from Gilead Sciences Inc., called remdesivir, that was developed to treat the deadly Ebola virus but then scrapped after proving less effective than rival drugs during testing.\nResearchers revived the drug after the Covid-19 virus was found to belong to a family of coronaviruses. In mice, remdesivir had worked against Middle East respiratory syndrome, another coronavirus.\nResearchers in the U.S. and China have started testing remdesivir in people infected with the coronavirus. The company says it will start its own late-stage studies this month.\nIn addition, Gilead has given the experimental drug—though it hasn’t been proved to work—on a compassionate basis to several hundred patients with confirmed, severe Covid-19 infections in the U.S., Europe and Japan, a company spokesman says.\nAlso under study are some approved HIV drugs, like Kaletra from AbbVie Inc. and Prezcobix from Johnson & Johnson, to see whether they could work against new-coronavirus infections. In January, both companies supplied their drugs to Chinese authorities for testing.\nMedia in China have reported that AbbVie’s Kaletra is proving effective, but the company says it can’t confirm the reports without access to data from the trial. A J&J spokesman says the company didn’t have an update on the China research.\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Sanofi SA are taking steps to start studying in patients whether their drug Kevzara, approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis, could treat symptoms of new-coronavirus infections.\nRoche Holding AG is exploring conducting U.S. studies of its similar-acting rheumatoid-arthritis drug, Actemra. Researchers in China have already begun a study, according to a spokeswoman for Roche’s Genentech subsidiary.\nPfizer Inc. and Merck & Co., which sell some of the world’s most widely used vaccines, say they are assessing whether their assets may be potentially worth using toward coronavirus. J&J aims to begin a trial later this year with its experimental vaccine candidate, while Sanofi hopes to potentially enter trials with its own within a year and a half.\nThe money question\nRecent history suggests that drugmakers will have a rough road ahead. In epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola and Zika, researchers and companies mobilized for vaccines and treatments, although the results were mixed.\nFor companies spending heavily on Covid-19 drugs and vaccines, one issue that could affect responses to future pandemics is the return on their investment, especially if the pandemic has run its course by the time a product has been approved for real-world use.\nIf Covid-19 ends up being a seasonal or recurring disease, there could be a stronger commercial opportunity for companies, which might be inclined to charge higher prices, Mr. Yee says, though he expects the opportunity to be minimal for now given the public-health emergency. He says Gilead is likely to employ a “humanitarian approach” with a price to merely recoup its development costs. Gilead said it hasn’t yet set a price for its drug and is focused on responding to the coronavirus outbreak.\nRoche’s influenza drug, called Tamiflu, reached about $3 billion in annual sales more than a decade ago, though sales have gradually declined.\nMr. Hopkins is a Wall Street Journal reporter in New York.

The group recommends boosting regional capacity for diagnosing the virus and installation of thermal cameras at the airport and port in Tallinn for the purpose of identifying potential carriers arriving in Estonia from risk areas.\nKiik admitted the need to prepare for additional confirmed cases of the virus. \"The working group deemed it necessary to further boost the preparedness of capable institutions and promote awareness. It was also decided that all public spaces could offer additional options for hand sanitation,\" the minister said.\nThe working group proposed boosting regional capacity to diagnose the virus. In addition to the Health Board's laboratory in Tallinn, the capacity to diagnose the virus should be created at the Tartu University Hospital, with the Ida-Viru Central Hospital and Pärnu Hospital considered.\nExperts also deem it necessary to install thermal cameras at Tallinn Airport and the Old Harbor of the Port of Tallinn to identify people who could be infected with the virus coming in from high-risk areas and send them to have their health checked if necessary.\nKiik told ERR in an interview that the social ministry has talked to suppliers and the system could become operational as early as next week.\nThe ministry will also be convening an international passenger transport working group.\nThe experts support the Health Board's recommendation for people returning from virus hotspots to not come in to work for two weeks following an agreement with their employer for the purpose of monitoring their condition. People who suspect they have caught the virus should call their family doctor or the family medicine hotline 1220.\nThe working group found no grounds for extending the school break or closing educational institutions. Every school has the right to make its own decisions and changes to study organization. The experts supported the Health Board's suggestion of allowing students returning from risk areas to stay home for two weeks.\nThe taskforce also supported recommendations by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Health Board not to travel to regions where COVID-19 is widespread (primarily China, Northern Italy, Iran, Singapore, Japan, South Korea) and revise travel plans in general.\nBanning cultural and sports events was not deemed expedient in the current situation. Event organizers are urged to pay extra attention to maintaining hygiene, including additional possibilities for hand sanitation.\nThe taskforce has proposed covering costs arising from the need to take additional measures. Initial costs associated with containing COVID-19 concern thermal cameras, personal protection devices and disinfectants, as well as additional human resources.

But this new movie, by Mostafa Keshvari, is unusual in that it was made even as the story is still unfolding.\nKeshvari’s 63-minute “Corona” looks at what happens when seven people are trapped in an elevator, and begin to realize that one of them has Covid-19. The movie is about fear and “a study of society, people and moral choices,” Keshvari, 33, said in recent phone and email interviews about the movie. “We are all in this ride together.”\nVancouver, known as “Hollywood North,” is Canada’s gateway to Asia, and also an epicenter in the country’s Covid-19 crisis. As news reached here of a “Wuhan virus,” there were increasing reports of harassment of Chinese-Canadians and others of Asian heritage. Patronage of Chinese-Canadian businesses dropped by up to 70 percent.\nThe filmmaker was in an elevator reading the headlines when he had the idea.\n“There were just so many incidents,” said Keshvari, who also runs BC Minorities in Film & TV Society, a network for budding artists from minority backgrounds. At the time he embarked on his project, “nobody thought a white person could get it. But the virus doesn’t discriminate.”\nIn real life, “everyone faces discrimination, all different kinds,” he said, so if he could “bring all these people” together in the film and “trap them,” he thought, then their “true colors come out.”\nStarting in late January, he spent two weeks writing the script; the set took 10 more days to create. “We rented a space and we built an elevator,” he said. “Ultralow budget.”\nSome cast members he already knew; others he found through word of mouth. The director also left room to improvise. “I told them: ‘Imagine that the actual coronavirus is in this elevator.’”\nHe wanted the action to unfold in real time, he said. “My struggle was to make sure it was all one shot,” Keshvari said.\nOver three days in February, it took nearly 70 takes to pull that off. Money was running out. And time. “It helped with the anxiety of the film,” he said.\nOutside, the coronavirus moved fast. “We thought it was just going to pass,” Keshvari said. “No one could have imagined.”\nHe had planned to submit the film, finished before the city declared a state of emergency, to festivals. “Unfortunately, that’s not the case anymore,” he said, as nearly every such event has been canceled for the foreseeable future. Streaming is the most likely option. The movie “belongs to humanity,” he said.\nAs for Keshvari’s cast and his crew of 25, he said, so far they are well."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india", "title": "Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India", "text": "Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India\nAttacks and boycotts escalate amid false claims that Muslim group to blame for epidemic\n- Coronavirus – latest updates\n- See all our coronavirus coverage\nThe men who beat Mehboob Ali did so without mercy. Dragging him to a field in the village of Harewali, on the fringes of north-west Delhi, the group hit him with sticks and shoes until he bled from his nose and ears. Ali was a Muslim, recently returned home from a religious gathering, and the Hindu mob was quite certain he was part of a so-called Islamic conspiracy to spread coronavirus to Hindus nationwide. His attackers believed the devout 22-year-old must be punished before he carried out “corona jihad”.\nThe allegations were entirely false, but according to video footage and his family, the men who beat Ali on 5 April were in little doubt of his guilt, demanding: “Tell us who else is behind this conspiracy.” Ali was then taken to a nearby Hindu temple and told to renounce Islam and convert to Hinduism before they would allow him to go to hospital.\nFive days after the attack Ali’s family was still in fear of also being accused of spreading the virus. “If we file a police case, the Hindus will not let us live in the village,” said one family member, who asked not to be named. Police confirmed that due to his attendance at a Muslim convention in Bhopal a few weeks back, Ali was being held in the isolation ward of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan hospital in Delhi as a “corona suspect”, though he had no symptoms.\nThe attack on Ali is symptomatic of the growing demonisation of India’s Muslim community, who are being accused, without any basis, of conducting a malevolent campaign to spread Covid-19 to the Hindu majority.\nAlready a minority under attack – it is just weeks since Hindu mobs attacked Muslims in religious riots in Delhi – Muslims have now seen their businesses across India boycotted, volunteers distributing rations called “coronavirus terrorists”, and others accused of spitting in food and infecting water supplies with the virus. Posters have appeared barring Muslims from entering certain neighbourhoods in states as far apart as Delhi, Karnataka, Telangana and Madhya Pradesh.\nThe troubles began when the gathering of an Islamic missionary organisation, Tablighi Jamaat, held in mid-March in the south Delhi neighbourhood of Nizamuddin, was singled out by police and government as being responsible for the spread of coronavirus across India. The convention, which had been given the go-ahead by the Delhi authorities, was attended by about 8,000 people, including hundreds of foreigners. It soon became apparent that many at the convention had unknowingly picked up Covid-19 and brought it back to towns and villages across India.\nAcross the country, police were ordered to round up anyone associated with the organisation. So far, more than 27,000 Tablighi Jamaat members and their contacts have been quarantined in about 15 states. In Uttar Pradesh, the police offered up to 10,000 rupees (£105) for information on anyone who had attended the gathering.\nIn a statement this week, the Indian Scientists’ Response to Covid-19 group said “the available data does not support the speculation” that the blame for the coronavirus epidemic in India lies mainly with Tablighi Jamaat. The scientists emphasised that while testing for coronavirus is extremely low across India, a disproportionate number have been of members of Tablighi Jamaat, as per a government order, therefore heavily skewing the figures.\nYet the test results were swiftly seized upon by members of the ruling ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), who claimed Tablighi Jamaat members had intended to infect millions as part of an Islamic conspiracy and were carrying out “corona terrorism”.\nSenior BJP leaders accused Tablighi Jamaat of carrying out a “Talibani crime”, described their members as “human bombs, but in the guise of coronavirus patients”, and called for Tablighi Jamaat leaders to be both hanged and shot. Kapil Mishra, a local BJP leader notorious for hate speeches, tweeted: “Tablighi Jamaat people have begun spitting on the doctors and other health workers. It’s clear, their aim is to infect as many people as possible with coronavirus and kill them.”\nThough quickly debunked, the rumours of Tablighi Jamaat members refusing to go into quarantine, assaulting hospital staff and throwing bottles of urine at Hindus quickly spread.\nHashtags such as “coronaJihad”, “CoronaTerrorism” and “CoronaBombsTablighi” began to trend on Twitter in India. Mainstream Indian media repeatedly asserted that Tablighi Jamaat members were coronavirus “superspreaders”.\nDr Zafarul-Islam Khan, chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, said that while Tablighi Jamaat had been shortsighted in holding the convention, there were “dozens of examples of government, political parties and other religious groups who also flouted the coronavirus restrictions and gathered in large numbers”.\nHe added: “But the whole focus is being directed only on Muslims. In the past few days, we have noted a new wave of attacks on Muslims across the country. There is talk of social boycott of Muslims, harassment of Muslims by Hindutva groups and Muslims are even being harassed by police in various areas.”\nThere has been a concentration of attacks against Muslims in Karnataka, where a BJP MP, Anant Kumar Hegde, has denounced Tablighi Jamaat as terrorists. Shortly after, an audio clip began to be shared widely over WhatsApp, urging people not to allow Muslim fruit and vegetable sellers into their areas, claiming they were spreading the virus through their produce.\nSayed Tabrez, 23, and his mother, Zareen Taj, 39, were among seven Muslim volunteers who were assaulted by a gang of local BJP members on 4 and 6 April, as they tried to distribute food to impoverished people in the Marathahalli and Dasarahalli districts of Karnataka.\n“Some 20 local BJP members came on motorbikes and started shouting at us, saying, ‘You are not allowed to give out rations – you are Muslims so you all are terrorists spreading the disease. We know you are spitting in the rations and have come from Tablighi Jamaat to spread the virus’,” said Tabrez. Two days later, about 25 local BJP members followed them in vehicles before attacking Tabrez, his mother and the other volunteers with bats. Police have since arrested two people.\nIt is not an isolated incident. Manohar Elavarthy of the NGO Swaraj Abhiyan, which has been distributing lockdown rations, said dozens of attacks had been carried out against their Muslim volunteers in the past few days, including some by police.\nIn Mangalore this week, posters started appearing that said Muslims were no longer allowed in certain neighbourhoods. “No Muslim trader will be allowed access to our hometown until the coronavirus is completely gone,” read a sign in Alape. In the Hindu-dominated village of Ankanahalli, a video seen by the Guardian shows Mahesh, the village panchayat president, issuing a warning that if any Hindu in the village is caught fraternising with a Muslim “you will be fined 500 to 1,000 rupees”.\nThe hijacking of coronavirus as an excuse for discrimination comes after a growing state-sponsored campaign to turn Muslims into second-class citizens in India, as part of the BJP’s agenda of Hindu nationalism. Attacks on Muslims have become commonplace and the recent citizenship amendment act, passed by the BJP in December, prompted millions to take to the streets in protest, saying it discriminated against Muslims.\nThe situation got so bad last week that it prompted Equality Labs, a US-based south Asian human rights organisation researching Islamophobic hate speech, to release a statement urging the World Health Organization to “issue further guidelines against Covid-19 hate speech and disconnect it to religious communities”.\n“Just weeks after the Delhi pogrom where hundreds of Muslim houses and shops were vandalised, an uptick in misinformation and harmful communal language are leading to violence,” said Equality Labs’ executive director, Thenmozhi Soundararajan. “The threat of another pogrom still looms.”"}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-the-maths-whizz-crunching-numbers-to-save-us-g0pc3t3s9", "title": "Coronavirus : the maths whizz crunching numbers to save us", "text": "Coronavirus: the maths whizz crunching numbers to save us\nStephen Bleach meets the academic charting the spread of the disease — and trying to stave off a pandemic\nAdam Kucharski shakes my hand, which is surprising.

This week saw that striking juxtaposition played out for real. Under a sky of unbroken light-grey cloud, isolated figures hurried through the spaces between Milan’s towering office blocks and across its broad traffic-free avenues. Meanwhile, inside a frantic Borsa Italiana, share prices were collapsing.\nOn February 21st the Italian authorities announced that a cluster of 16 cases of covid-19, the disease associated with the novel virus SARS-CoV-2, had been detected around Codogno, a small town in Lombardy 60km south-east of Milan. By the next day the number was up to 60, and five elderly people had died. On the 23rd “red zones” were set up around the infected areas (see map). Inside the zones there is a strict lockdown; outside 500 police officers and soldiers stop people from leaving. On the same day the government of Lombardy ordered the closure of any establishment where large numbers of people gather, including cinemas, schools and universities. Inter Milan has missed a home match; the legendary opera house, La Scala, is shuttered; sightseers are barred from the cathedral—though worshippers are not.\nIran, where the first covid-19 cases were reported two days before Italy’s, has also closed schools and cancelled football games. There too, though, worship continues, with what appear to have been dire consequences. The ceaseless flow of pilgrims to the mosques and shrines of Qom has continued despite the city being the site of the first cases. Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, an MP from the city, said on February 24th that the death toll there had reached 50, though other officials deny this. Recent cases of covid-19 in Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon and Pakistan are all thought to be linked to returnees from Iran.\nThe outbreaks in Italy and Iran, along with a large one in South Korea, have convinced many epidemiologists that attempts to keep the virus contained within China have run their course; it will now spread from second countries to third countries and on around the world. As of February 27th, cases had been reported in 50 countries (see chart). Studies suggest that the number of people who have left China carrying the disease is significantly higher than would be inferred from the cases so far reported to have cropped up elsewhere, strongly suggesting that the virus’s spread has been underestimated. Some public-health officials still talk in terms of the window for containment coming closer and closer to closing. In reality, it seems to have slammed shut.\nThat is the message the world’s financial markets have taken; the Borsa Italiana in Milan was far from alone in its miseries. Investors had previously acted as though the economic impacts of covid-19 would be limited to China and those whose supply chains wind through it. The spread of the disease to South Korea, Iran and Italy caused a massive sell-off on February 24th. The next day prices fell further when the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans to prepare for the virus.\nAs of the morning of February 27th, stock markets had fallen by 8% in America, 7.4% in Europe and 6.2% in Asia over the past seven days. The industries, commodities and securities that are most sensitive to global growth, cross-border commerce and densely packed public spaces got whacked particularly hard, with the prices of oil and shares in airlines, cruise-ship owners, casinos and hotel companies all tumbling. Investors have taken refuge in assets that are perceived to be safe: yields on ten-year Treasury bonds reached an all-time low of 1.3%. The place least hit was China, where a huge sell-off took place some time ago. Investors, like some public-health officials, are starting to think that the epidemic there is, for now, under control (see article). But if economic models developed for other diseases hold good, the rich world stands a distinct chance of slipping into recession as the epidemic continues. That will bring China, and everyone else, a fresh set of problems.\nThe paths all taken\nHow the virus will spread in the weeks and months to come is impossible to tell. Diseases can take peculiar routes, and dally in unlikely reservoirs, as they hitchhike around the world. Two cases in Lebanon lead to worries about the camps in which millions of people displaced from Syria are now crowded together and exposed to the winter weather. But regardless of exactly how the virus spreads, spread it will. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has not yet pronounced covid-19 a pandemic—which is to say, a large outbreak of disease affecting the whole world. But that is what it now is.\nPart of the WHO’s reticence is that the P-word frightens people, paralyses decision making and suggests that there is no further possibility of containment. It is indeed scary—not least because, ever since news of the disease first emerged from Wuhan, the overwhelming focus of attention outside China has been the need for a pandemic to be avoided. That many thousands of deaths now seem likely, and millions possible, is a terrible thing. But covid-19 is the kind of disease with which, in principle, the world knows how to deal.\nThe course of an epidemic is shaped by a variable called the reproductive rate, or R. It represents, in effect, the number of further cases each new case will give rise to. If R is high, the number of newly infected people climbs quickly to a peak before, for want of new people to infect, starting to fall back again (see chart 2). If R is low the curve rises and falls more slowly, never reaching the same heights. With SARS-CoV-2 now spread around the world, the aim of public-health policy, whether at the city, national or global scale, is to flatten the curve, spreading the infections out over time.\nThis has two benefits. First, it is easier for health-care systems to deal with the disease if the people infected do not all turn up at the same time. Better treatment means fewer deaths; more time allows treatments to be improved. Second, the total number of infections throughout the course of the epidemic can be lower.\nTo flatten the curve you must slow the spread. The virus appears to be transmitted primarily through virus-filled droplets that infected people cough or sneeze into the air. This means transmission can be reduced through physical barriers, good hygiene and reducing various forms of mingle—a strategy known as “social distancing”. Such measures are already routinely used to control the spread of the influenza virus, which spreads in a similar way and is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths a year.\nInfluenza, like many other respiratory diseases, thrives in cold and humid air. If covid-19 behaves the same way, spreading less as the weather gets warmer and drier, flattening the curve will bring an extra benefit. As winter turns to spring then summer, the reproductive rate will drop of its own accord. Dragging out the early stage of the pandemic means fewer deaths before the summer hiatus provides time to stockpile treatments and develop new drugs and vaccines—efforts towards both of which are already under way.\nBen Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, says that the intensity of the measures countries employ to flatten the curve will depend on how deadly SARS-CoV-2 turns out to be. It is already clear that, for the majority of people who get sick, covid-19 is not too bad, especially among the young: a cough and a fever. In older people and those with chronic health problems such as heart disease or diabetes, the infection risks becoming severe and sometimes fatal. How often it will do so, though, is not known.\nAn epidemic’s fatality rate can only be definitively calculated after the fact: you take a population in which you know how many died and test a large random sample for antibodies against the pathogen in question—antibodies they will only have in their system if they were once infected. The Chinese authorities have just approved such tests, but they have yet to begin.\nEstimates of the proportion of the infected made in the thick of things are, by contrast, liable to two different types of error. One affects the numerator—the number of the dead—and one the denominator—the number infected.\nMixed fractions\nThe first stems from the fact that there are always some people destined to die who have not died yet. People who die from covid-19 typically do so some three weeks after the onset of symptoms. If you divide the number of the dead at a given time by the number infected up until then you will miss those who will die in the next few weeks, and your answer will be misleadingly small.\nThe second sort of error, typically seen near the beginning of an epidemic, pushes in the other direction. People diagnosed early on tend to be very ill. It takes further investigation, and broader public awareness, to turn up all the people suffering only mild symptoms. Before that is done, an underestimate of the number infected leads to an overestimate of the fatality rate.\nAnalysis of data from more than 40,000 Chinese patients who had tested positive for the virus by February 11th found that, at the time, about 80% had mild symptoms, 14% had symptoms severe enough to warrant hospital care and oxygen, and 5% were critical, requiring intensive care that often included mechanical aids to breathing. Based on that data, the fatality rate in Hubei, the province in which Wuhan sits, was 2.9%. Outside Hubei it was 0.4%.\nThere are various reasons why the rate in Hubei would be expected to be genuinely higher than elsewhere. Its hospitals had no warning of the sudden influx of covid-19 patients and were thus overwhelmed, whereas hospitals in other cities had more time to prepare, laying in respirators and oxygen. Hubei’s doctors had to work out how to treat a brand-new disease, whereas those elsewhere have been able to learn from both their successes and failures.\nBut many experts think that a lot of the difference stems from the early-stage small-denominator problem. In other places there has been time and an incentive for less severe cases to be diagnosed, and so the fraction that has proved fatal is lower. At the moment, epidemiologists reckon the true rate for covid-19 is in the range of 0.5-1%. For SARS, a disease caused by another coronavirus which broke out in 2003, the rate in China was never fully ascertained; but worldwide, the WHO put it at about 10%. The rate for seasonal flu in America is typically around 0.1%.\nThe fatality rate is not an inherent property of the virus; it also depends on the care received. This puts poorer countries at particular risk. They tend to have weaker public-health systems in the first place, and thus can expect higher levels of serious disease and death—including, sometimes, among overstretched and inappropriately protected front-line health-care workers. That puts further strains on their health systems. And this will all be exacerbated by the pandemic’s economic effects, which models suggest will also be greater in poorer countries. Higher fatality rates causes larger hits to the workforce. Service industries in poorer countries are less digitised, meaning they require face-to-face contact, and therefore are more likely to be avoided when consumers take fright. And poor countries risk capital flight when financial markets are spooked by risk. They could lose their ability to borrow and spend just when they need it most.\nBetter health care reduces the fatality rate. Better public-health interventions reduce the total rate of infections. Epidemiologists start their curve-producing models off with a “basic reproductive rate”, Ro. This is the rate at which cases lead to new cases in a population that has never seen the disease before (and thus has no immunity) and is doing nothing to stop its spread. Estimates of Ro for covid-19 based on data for Wuhan put it at between 2 and 2.5, according to the WHO. Academics reckon that an Ro around this range could see between 25% and 70% of the world becoming infected.\nHow an epidemic actually unfolds, though, depends not on Ro but on R, the effective reproductive rate. If policymakers and public-health officials are doing their job and a trusting public pays attention, this should be less than Ro. The lower it gets, the flatter the curve; get R below one, and the curve starts to slope down. That will not wipe out the virus completely. But it will eventually see it limited to sporadic outbreaks, usually when the rare infected person mingles with lots of vulnerable people (such as those in nursing homes).\nBack to school\nIt is possible that the huge efforts made in China have reduced R nearly this far—hence the current optimism there. Outside Hubei, cities which pre-emptively imposed travel restrictions and bans on large gatherings have seen flatter epidemic curves; the measure that made the biggest difference was closing down public transport. There is now a risk, though, that as people start going back to work and school new infections will start to rise (see article). Bruce Aylward, who led a WHO-appointed group of experts sent to investigate the situation in China, says the authorities have used the time when transmission was severely suppressed to prepare and re-equip hospitals.\nAs the pandemic unfolds, the reproductive rate in different parts of the world will differ according both to the policies put in place and the public’s willingness to follow them. Few countries will be able to impose controls as strict as China’s. In South Korea the government has invoked the power to forcibly stop any public activities, such as mass protests; schools, airports and military bases are closed. Japan is urging companies to introduce staggered working hours and virtual meetings, limiting both crowding on public transport and mingling at work. Other developed countries are mostly not going that far, as yet. Something that is acceptable in one country might result in barely any compliance, or even mass protests in another.\nThere will also be scapegoating and fear. In Novi Sanzhary, in Ukraine, a busload of evacuees from Wuhan was attacked. To assuage fears, the country’s health minister joined the evacuees in quarantine, demonstrating that she could do her job remotely. Other politicians will be less noble. In a world where disinformation on social media is already a much used tool, covid-19 will provide new opportunities for spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt. Disrupting attempts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by such means could be an easy way to weaponise it.\nIn countries with stronger public-health systems, data scientists will busily model the course of the epidemic as it unfolds. Such modelling already informs public-health choices during flu season in many countries, suggesting when various measures might be prudent. They could in principle be adapted to covid-19. But for the time being such adapted models will be a lot less useful than the ones for flu, because much less is known about covid-19’s basic biology. For example, the question of whether infected people can transmit the disease before they show any symptoms is a matter of quite hot debate. If they can, then putting heavy stress on having infected people isolate themselves will be much less effective than it would otherwise be, because many infectious people will not know that they carry the virus.\nThere is also no explanation for the low number of children so far diagnosed with the disease. Do they not get it? Or do they get very mild, or different, symptoms? Either way, this will make the dynamics of covid-19 quite different from those of flu, where high rates of spread among children are a big factor, and closing schools can bring large gains.\nHowever well people put up with whatever social distancing is asked of them, covid-19 will hurt the economy. Until recently, market analysts expected China to have a slow first quarter but world GDP to be little affected. When on February 22nd the IMF revised its global growth forecast for the year, it was merely shaved down from 3.3% to 3.2%. A full blown pandemic can be expected to have a much deeper impact.\nViral messaging\nWork would be lost both to disease and to social distancing. The financial system was not much hit by this week’s market falls. Although the riskier corners of the debt markets suffered some jitters, the borrowing costs for the biggest Western banks remained fairly stable. However, large poorly understood risks are likely to reduce investment. Consumers could stop spending, both through fear and because controls on mingling reduce opportunities for various types of fun.\nSuch effects can be out of proportion to their cause. When South Korea had a small outbreak of 186 cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015, the hit to the economy totalled $8.2bn, or about $44m per infection, points out Olga Jonas of Harvard University. Cities with large service sectors are particularly vulnerable; the economic impact of SARS was greatest in places like Hong Kong and Beijing.\nSome hints of what may be to come can be gleaned from an economic model of an influenza pandemic created by Warwick McKibbin and Alexandra Sidorenko, both then at Australian National University, in 2006. Covid-19 is not flu: it seems to hit people in the prime of their working life less often, which is good, but to take longer to recover from, which isn’t. But the calculations in their model—which were being updated for covid-19 as The Economist went to press—give some sense of what may be to come (see chart 3).\nIn their “severe” scenario, a pandemic similar to the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918-19, global GDP dropped by nearly 5%. If that were to happen today, it would cause a slump similar in size to that of 2009. In their “mild” scenario—30% of people infected, losing on average ten days’ work each, and a fatality rate of 0.25%—the cost was just 0.8% of global GDP. That would mean losing about a quarter of the global growth previously forecast for this year.\nMr McKibbin says the moderate scenario in that paper looks closest to covid-19, which suggests a 2% hit to global growth. That corresponds to calculations by Oxford Economics, a consultancy, which put the possible costs of covid-19 at 1.3% of GDP. Such a burden would not be evenly spread. Oxford Economics sees America and Europe both being tipped into recession—particularly worrying for Europe, which has little room to cut interest rates in response, and where the country currently most exposed, Italy, is already a cause for economic concern. But poor countries would bear the biggest losses from a pandemic, relative to their economies’ size.\nAs the world climbs the epidemic curve, biomedical researchers and public-health experts will rush to understand covid-19 better. Their achievements are already impressive; there is realistic talk of evidence on new drugs within months and some sort of vaccine within a year. Techniques of social distancing are already being applied. But they will need help from populations that neither dismiss the risks nor panic. The patrons at the Tempio Caffè, just off Milan’s Piazza Cavour, had it about right: not too disturbed, getting informed. Only one of the ten breakfasting on cappuccino and brioche was wearing a mask, and she was Chinese.■\nThis article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline \"Flattening the curve\""}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/two-irish-tourists-test-positive-for-coronavirus-on-cruise-ship-k5cr3x0fw", "title": "Two Irish tourists test positive for coronavirus on cruise ship", "text": "Two Irish tourists test positive for coronavirus on cruise ship\nHealth officials have told people to ring their doctor if they think they have coronavirus.

Now, our biggest national crisis since World War II has set off a tectonic shift, transforming the country in ways we couldn't have imagined.\nThat's the big idea of a new political frame by Doug Sosnik, a former White House political director for President Clinton whose periodic \"big thinks\" are eagerly awaited by political insiders and activists alike.\nHere are some of his most provocative, market-moving top lines:\n1) America was a divided country before COVID-19: President Trump’s election in 2016 was the culmination of a trend toward tribal politics in our country that began forming in the early 1990s. Early indications are that the fallout from COVID-19 will at least initially exacerbate these divisions.\n- This partisan splinter is evident in a Gallup poll out April 26, which found that 44% of Republicans say they’re ready to return to normal activities, compared to only 4% of Democrats.\n2) For the next 180 days, Trump’s campaign will try mightily to make the election about a choice between him and Joe Biden.\n- But given the political landscape, it will likely come down to a referendum on Trump's presidency.\n3) Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, Trump entered his re-election race in a reasonably good position — undermined since the onset by his handling of the crisis and the economic devastation.\n- During this period, the Democratic Party consolidated behind Biden. This is the earliest it has united behind a nominee in 20 years.\n- Smart brevity™: Trump's chances for re-election have diminished significantly since early March due to: 1) Sen. Bernie Sanders, the presumed nominee in back then, won't be his opponent ... 2) Trump’s failure to prepare for and manage the pandemic ... 3) The resulting economic crater.\n4) The six states that were considered battlegrounds before COVID-19 — Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — will continue to define the presidential contest.\n- Early polls of registered voters in those states show Biden performing very well against Trump.\n- Midwestern states, Michigan and Pennsylvania in particular, have been really hard hit by the crisis.\n5) Trump’s campaign strategy: Tear down Biden, focus on the six battleground states, energize his base, and make it as difficult as possible for infrequent, anti-Trump voters to turn out.\n- Conventional wisdom is that larger turnout benefits Democrats, but that's not necessarily the case in the swing Midwestern states. As the Trump campaign discovered, there were large number of non-voters in these states who would have supported Trump in 2016 if they had turned out.\n6) Given the critical role that Trump’s job approval and the economy will play, there's a real question whether the campaign will affect the arc of the race in a significant way.\n- Past presidential re-election campaign outcomes, and extensive academic research, suggest that the answer is not much.\nSosnik's bottom line: Trump based his entire presidency on appealing to his base, focusing on the strength of the economy — which has now collapsed.\nThe full deck:\nThe full memo:"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/15/coronavirus-the-huge-unknows-by-robin-mckie", "title": "Coronavirus : the huge unknowns", "text": "Coronavirus: the huge unknowns\nCoronavirus: the huge unknowns\nWith no vaccines or treatments and limited diagnostic tools, we face a tough challenge in the fight against Covid-19\nAfew years ago, the World Health Organisation published a list of pathogens which it said needed urgent scientific attention. All were viruses, none had known treatments or vaccines, and all had the potential to trigger pandemics that could kill thousands – just as Ebola and swine flu did earlier this century.\nThe viral dangers outlined in WHO’s list included Nipah disease, as well as Lassa and Rift Valley fevers. Crucially, after much discussion, WHO experts later decided to add a new condition to this menu of maladies: Disease X.\nDisease X referred to “a serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown”, said WHO. Humanity should now be working to seek out and tackle such mystery ailments, it added – though it was assumed they would remain remote threats for some time.\nThis hope now looks forlorn with the sudden emergence of the respiratory disease Covid-19, which has rapidly acquired most of the characteristic of a Disease X. It is caused by a virus for which there is no vaccine or treatment and has already spread to 25 countries since first appearing in China two months ago. Very soon it may be officially labelled a pandemic, an epidemic gone global.\nThe question is: was enough done to prepare the world for the emergence of Disease X, given that such a prospect had already been earmarked as a realistic risk? And what lessons do we now need to learn in a world that will certainly see further appearances of others?\nThese points have been stressed by Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist. “Given the continual emergence of new pathogens ... and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal pandemic will occur in our lifetime,” he warned some time ago.\nA sufficiently deadly one will have the impact of a nuclear war, added Gates, who has urged authorities to stockpile antiviral drugs and therapies in preparation.\nSuch approaches are backed by other experts who argue that, while the US, UK and EU may have strong, well-funded health services, poorer nations in Africa and Asia – where new disease outbreaks are most likely to occur – have health services that are often poorly funded and close to breaking point.\n“This is not going to be the last outbreak of a previously unknown disease,” said Professor Trudie Lang, of Oxford University. “We have to strengthen the research capabilities of nations where new diseases emerge but which currently have the poorest ability to respond to the emergence caused by these viruses.”\nMany WHO initiatives are aimed at providing improved health networks in these countries, said Lang, but more still needs to be done. “We have to seize the moment.”\nThis point was backed by Dr Josie Golding, epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust. “World health authorities have spent a lot of time and money making plans for dealing with the next major outbreak, which was assumed would be an influenza pandemic. A lot of investment has gone into making influenza vaccines, for example.\n“But have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don’t think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking. We just didn’t envisage a Disease X emerging on the scale we had seen with an influenza pandemic. We will do that in future.”\nAnother indication of the problem was provided last week by WHO when it revealed that most countries in its African region had no ability to test for the Covid-19 virus. Yet China’s influence in Africa is strong and many fear there is a real risk of the virus being brought into nations there. Undetected, it could become a new epidemic centre for Covid-19.\nThe problem was stressed last week by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s director general. “Our greatest fear remains the damage the coronavirus could do in a country like Democratic Republic of the Congo,” he said. Worryingly, it was revealed on Friday that a Corvid-19 case has just been discovered in Egypt.\nAccording to Lang, the key to the problem lies with good diagnostics. At the moment, saliva samples are taken to laboratories to be tested. “What the world really needs is a handheld diagnostic kit that can be used by a health worker and does not require samples being shipped off to central labs. Then we can get a measure of how quickly a disease liked Covid-19 is establishing itself.”\nTo date, there have been more than 69,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection and more than 1,660 deaths since the disease first appeared. However, outside China, there have been only 500 cases and four deaths: one in Hong Kong, one in the Philippines, one in Japan, and one in France.\nIt remains to be seen if the disease will be limited in its spread, said Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University. “There are so many huge unknowns about this outbreak. For example, we don’t know just how infectious people are before they show symptoms. That makes it impossible to predict what is going to happen.”\nWoolhouse added that both the UK and WHO had learned lessons from recent pandemics, but mostly on those involving influenza. “The trouble is, this outbreak is caused by a very different virus. And unlike flu, there are no vaccines or treatments and, crucially, no pre-existing immunity in the population.” During the 2009-10 flu pandemic this had protected many older people because they had already been exposed to the virus strain involved.\n“On the other hand, it takes longer for a person with the coronavirus to pass it on to another person than it does with flu,” added Woolhouse. “So that slows things down.”\nAt present, health services are trying to contain Covid-19 using case detection, isolation and prevention of onward transmission. That has involved, to date, the testing of almost 3,000 people in the UK, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Of these, nine tested positive.\nThus, several hundred negatives were produced for each detection of one case. If the disease is perceived in future as an even greater danger than it is now, health services could be overwhelmed. That, in turn, risks disrupting treatments for other serious illnesses which Britain’s NHS is already struggling to treat.\nNor will the nation be protected against disruptions far from our shores. An example is provided by the digger manufacturer JCB which last week announced it was cutting working hours for 4,000 of its staff because it was facing a shortage of components from China.\n“It is quite simple: outbreaks like these are problems that affect the whole planet,” added Lang.\nWhat is a coronavirus?\nBefore this new coronavirus (Covid-19), there were six known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness and two can result in more severe disease: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers). They are transmitted via droplets in coughs and sneezes.\nWhere did this one originate? Why there?\nOn 31 December 2019, Chinese authorities notified the WHO of an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan City. Coronaviruses can jump from one species to another. A study published in Nature suggests that the novel coronavirus, now named Covid-19, originated in bats. It is possible that humans first picked up the virus in a meat market.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nMost people who get the virus will have only symptoms similar to winter flu, but a small proportion, often the elderly, will develop pneumonia . The symptoms of the virus can include dry cough, fever and fatigue.\nHow dangerous is it?\nThe mortality rate is not accurately known yet but based on the available data it is probably around 1-2%.

The virus is concerning, Bee said, but some are incorrectly and irresponsibly channeling their fear into racism against Asian people. Bee played several clips from Fox News of anchors blaming China for the virus, and the Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade demanded an apology. “China, we know it’s not your bad,” said Bee, “but could you please send Brian Kilmeade an edible arrangement so he’ll shut the f*** up.\n“Tying coronavirus to China and Chinese people isn’t just a racist dog whistle – it’s a whole racist orchestra,” said Bee. “It’s a mighty, mighty racist bosstone, which brings me to this important point: The coronavirus is not an excuse to be racist.\n“I know racism is like America’s weighted blanket,” Bee continued. “When everything is stressful, nothing makes us feel more secure than treating other people like trash.” For example, Asian American businesses are suffering as people incorrectly fear transmission through Chinese food; Asian Americans have been denied business and faced violence. In Los Angeles, an Asian American teen was beaten up so badly at school he had to go to the hospital. One man tried to spray a person he believed to be Asian with Febreze on a New York subway. “What the f***? The only person you should be afraid of in that situation is the guy who keeps Febreze on him at all times,” said Bee. “Whatever that Febreze is usually for is very bad.\n“Covid-19 is scary and it’s made even scarier because our government is mishandling this crisis and conservative media is using Asian people as scapegoats,” Bee concluded: “The Trump administration is not going to save us. We have to take care of each other. It is not OK to mistreat people out of fear and panic.”\nStephen Colbert\nCoronavirus is “making people nervous”, said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show, “but I think at a time like this we all need to laugh, and be together – from a distance of, like, 20 feet or something like that.” So starting Monday, “out of an abundance of caution”, the Late Show and other late-night programs will forgo studio audiences.\nBut first, Colbert recapped public health expert Dr Anthony Fauci’s address to Congress on Wednesday, in which he warned: “As a nation, we can’t be doing the kind of things we were doing a few months ago.”\n“But I want to! A few months ago was great,” Colbert protested. “It was the holidays, I was drunk on eggnog, I was watching Cheer, I was falling in love with Baby Yoda, I was looking forward to impeaching the president. Remember that feeling?\n“It’s only March,” said Colbert, and yet “2020 has done the impossible: it’s made me nostalgic for 2019.”\nTo further muddy the waters on information, the coronavirus taskforce leader and “man who has quarantined his mind from knowledge”, Mike Pence, announced yesterday that health insurance companies had agreed to waive co-pays for corona testing and cover costs for treating the virus (this was apparently news to insurance companies). “Oh what a cool idea,” said Colbert. “It’s like Medicare … but for all.”\nSeth Meyers\nOn Late Night, Seth Meyers looked to Italy for clues as to where America could be headed. The country has gone on full lockdown, including no sporting events. “Do you know how bad things have to be for Italians to cancel soccer matches?” said Meyers. “Italians love soccer more than they love talking with their hands, and they love talking with their hands.”\nNot that Trump has taken this threat seriously. Meyers pointed to Trump’s statement on Tuesday that the coronavirus situation was “really working out and a lot of good things are gonna happen”.\n“The World Health Organization just called it a pandemic, and the president sounds like your stoner friend trying to get you through a bad acid trip,” said Meyers. “‘Don’t worry bro, just stay calm, a lot of good things are gonna happen!’”\nJust two weeks ago, Trump claimed the US had only 15 cases and dropping “close to zero”. “He could not have been more wrong,” said Meyers. “‘Close to zero is an insane thing to say when you’re on the brink of a disease outbreak. That should be emblazoned in history as the worst presidential prediction since Abraham Lincoln said, ‘I’m gonna see like 10 plays this year.’”\nTrevor Noah\nOn the Daily Show, Trevor Noah spoke to Wednesday’s collective coronavirus freakout. “I know we’re all scared, but panic is not going to help anything,” he said. “We’re still learning about this, we’re still learning about the mortality rate, and panic is not helping.” Right now, some people are letting their panic make them dumb as shit,” Noah said before showing clips of people fighting over toilet paper. “People, what are you doing? You do not need to panic over toilet paper.\n“I feel like people in first world countries don’t know what to panic about,” Noah said. “Toilet paper? Are you shitting me? What’s next? Are people just going to be running around Walmart like, oh, where’s the car wax?!\n“Avoid panicking, because if you panic, you stop thinking clearly,” Noah concluded. “And if you’re not thinking clearly, then you’ll start to believe anything that you hear,” such as “cures” including chewing garlic or drinking bleach.\n“Drinking bleach, snorting cocaine and masturbating is not the way to cure corona,” Noah said. “It’s the way to kick off the most rock’n’-roll party of your life.”"}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/trump-intervention-saudi-russia-oil-dispute-3c8d58f2-c6db-46da-9b6f-5b8e794daa3b.html", "title": "Trump eyes intervention in Saudi - Russia oil dispute", "text": "Trump eyes intervention in Saudi-Russia oil dispute\nPhoto: Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\nPresident Trump said Thursday he's eyeing intervention in the oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, a dispute that combined with COVID-19's economic toll is pushing prices sharply downward and creating financial jeopardy for U.S. producers.\nAt the appropriate time, I will get involved, yes.— President Trump\nWhy it matters: The pledge came in Trump's first extensive comments on the upended oil market, but he also suggested that he has mixed feelings about the price collapse.\n- Trump, at a White House briefing on the COVID-19 response, said low gas prices were helpful to consumers.

However, the plan requires congressional approval."}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/international/2020/04/16/governments-are-starting-to-ease-restrictions", "title": "Emergency exit - Governments are starting to ease restrictions | International", "text": "AFTER SPENDING the long Easter break cooped up at home some Spaniards went back to work this week. They were greeted at transport hubs by police officers and Red Cross volunteers handing out face-masks. Though reported as a “relaxing” of the lockdown imposed a month ago, the government insists that it is not. Only those who cannot work from home are allowed to go back to their workplaces. Most shops remain closed, as do schools, bars, restaurants and hotels. Outdoor exercise is still banned and enforcement is tight: between March 14th and April 6th the police arrested 3,267 people and levied 340,000 fines for breaking the lockdown.\nSpain seems to have turned a corner in one of the worst outbreaks of covid-19. The daily number of cases has begun to fall, compared with a daily increase of around 30% a month ago. Hospitals which were overwhelmed a fortnight ago now have some spare capacity. But Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister, was clear. “We aren’t even beginning the second phase,” he said on April 12th. “De-escalation will begin in a fortnight at the earliest, and it will be gradual and cautious,” Mr Sánchez insisted.\nGovernments around the world are trying to work out how to exit their covid-19 lockdowns. Several other European countries, including Austria, Germany, Norway and the Czech Republic, are reopening nurseries, schools and shops as their efforts to stop the spread of covid-19 start, as in Spain, to pay off (see table). In various American states discussions of exit strategies are gaining traction. In New York state, where covid-19 has killed more than 10,000 people in just a month, the total number of cases in hospitals is starting to plateau. On April 13th, along with five other states on the east coast, it disclosed it was working on a strategy for reopening the region’s economy. On the same day three states on the west coast, including California, announced a similar project.\nThe big unknown is whether any of the exit strategies being considered or implemented will avoid a second wave of infections. Researchers at Imperial College London estimate that, even when the many infections that were never registered are added to the total, just 1-15% of people in Europe had some immunity to covid-19 at the end of March. Until a vaccine is available, governments will need to keep sufficient numbers of infected people tightly quarantined to prevent new outbreaks that would overwhelm their health systems. But most failed to do this during the early days of covid-19. That is why the epidemics grew so bad that they needed to implement full lockdowns to save hospitals from disaster. It is not yet clear that they will do well enough the second time around to prevent a resurgence of the disease.\nGovernments in countries that are already past the peak of the first wave of their epidemics have some breathing space to plan for their post-lockdown future. More important, they have better data. They have a clearer sense of how their hospitals will cope with a certain number of cases of covid-19. They no longer need to rely on data from China to make educated guesses about how their populations and health systems might fare. Such experience matters for all sorts of reasons. For example, the spread of the disease among the close-knit intergenerational households in southern Europe is different from the paths it takes in the insular societies of northern Europe where a large share of old people live alone or in care homes.\nEven with these data, however, government planners do not know which restrictions they should begin to ease and when. “There are no absolutes here,” says Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation (WHO); the evidence that when countries reach a specific number of cases they should take particular actions does not yet exist. The accepted wisdom is that countries can begin to consider easing restrictions when the number of new cases is tapering off, and their hospitals have free beds—in other words, when they can accommodate a surge in infections that could follow the easing of a lockdown.\nThose easing lockdowns are using one principle: the epidemic must be under control. Austria was the first European country to announce a comprehensive plan detailing when various sectors would be allowed to reopen. In the first week of April tests of a random sample of about 1,600 people found that fewer than 1% had active covid-19 infections. Norway decided to begin reopening kindergartens from April 20th after scientists advising the government reported that the epidemic’s reproduction rate—the number of new infections generated by each case—had fallen to 0.7. If the reproduction rate of a contagion is lower than one then an epidemic will die down over time. Spain’s health ministry plans to test a sample of at least 30,000 families around the country over the next three weeks to get a sense of the real scale of the outbreak and the extent to which the population has acquired any immunity.\nHarder than the decision about when to lift restrictions is choosing which to lift first. The reasoning varies from country to country, but the conclusions are often the same. Norway’s commission, which assessed the long-term costs to society of various combinations of restrictions, found that closing primary schools and nurseries were among the costliest policies. In Denmark, too, nurseries and primary schools opened first on April 15th; older children may be allowed back to school a month later. (Not all parents were impressed; 40,000 Danes have joined a Facebook group called “My kid is not going to be a Guinea Pig for Covid-19”.) And in Germany, which outlined an exit strategy on April 15th, schools will start to reopen on May 4th, but only for those children facing exams. “Emergency” services for the parents of younger children will be expanded.\nBack to abnormal\nNowhere, however, is the slow lifting of lockdowns a return to business as usual. Europeans going back to shops, trains and offices will have to follow new hygiene and social-distancing rules—some of which were introduced during the lockdowns. Austrians and Czechs are already required to wear face-masks in public spaces, including at work; Spain is considering a similar requirement. Shops in many countries will have to limit the number of customers in at any one time. Norway’s guidelines, released on April 15th, say that children in nurseries must be split into smaller cohorts, with three-year-olds in groups of three and older children in groups of six; each group will be assigned one adult. Changes to the cohorts will be permitted no more than once a week.\nLike the lockdowns themselves, many of these new rules are transplants from China, which has, its government says, avoided a second wave of infections. In Beijing employers must keep their employees separated, so many firms have only a fraction of their workers on-site each day, with the rest working at home where possible. Restaurants must limit the number of customers to keep them apart. Chinese schools which have welcomed back their students have introduced measures to minimise infections: constant ventilation of classrooms; extra spacing between desks; frequent cleaning and disinfecting; the reduction of the size of classes; staggered dismissal times, to avoid crowding; assigned seating and installation of partitions in dining areas. The list goes on and on. And officials stress that they will pull back and make adjustments if they see signs of a second wave.\nThere is no solid evidence that any one of these measures alone is particularly effective in reducing the transmission of the new coronavirus. The hope is that in combination they could work reasonably well. In China, however, the easing of lockdown has been accompanied by stringent efforts to identify and quarantine those infected and their close contacts. In some areas restaurants must sign in every customer—and if any later test positive to notify those who visited at the same time. China’s strategy suggests that Europe and America’s plans to stop infections after they lift their lockdowns with masks, good hygiene and social distancing may not be enough.\nInstead post-lockdown life might more closely resemble that in South Korea, a democracy with a population similar in size to England’s, throughout its covid-19 outbreak. Unlike America and much of Europe, South Korea has never instituted a complete lockdown. Even at the height of the outbreak people remained mostly free to go about their lives thanks to extensive testing, tracing and isolation of infections. In only 10% of cases have public-health investigators been unable to determine the source of infection. New daily infections are now below 30.\nIt’s life, Jim, but not as we know it\nDespite the pandemic on April 15th South Korea held legislative elections. But schools, universities, museums and many churches have been closed for weeks, and there are no plans to reopen them. Travellers returning from abroad must quarantine themselves for two weeks, either at home or in government-provided facilities. Breaking quarantine can lead to fines, jail or, for foreigners, deportation. The government advice still discourages leaving home for non-essential reasons, especially socialising in groups.\nCompliance with social-distancing recommendations, however, is flagging. Using data gathered from mobile-phone masts, South Korea’s disaster-response agency estimates that people moved around about 16% more in the last week of March compared with the last week of February, which was the height of the outbreak. That number is likely to have ticked up further in recent days. Seoul’s restaurants are filling up again. Hiking trails teemed with people over the weekend.\nAnd yet of the roughly 57,000 people currently in strict self-isolation, just over 100 have been caught violating it. After various groups voiced concerns about privacy, the government abandoned a plan to issue electronic wristbands to everyone in quarantine. Instead, it will now provide them only to those who have broken their quarantine and even then only with the person’s consent. The public supports the idea either way; in a poll conducted by the culture ministry, more than 80% said the wristbands were a good idea.\nSouth Korea’s experience has prompted some European countries and a few American states to begin ramping up their contact-tracing capacity as they prepare to lift their lockdowns. That requires expanding public-health departments; calling everyone an infected person has been in close contact with—and checking on them regularly during their 14-day quarantine—is hugely labour-intensive.\nIs antibody out there?\nIt is not a highly skilled job; anyone with a secondary-school education can be trained in a day. But with a disease that spreads as easily as covid-19, enormous numbers of workers are needed. Public-health departments in America are currently doing this sort of work for outbreaks of sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis and the occasional measles outbreak. But the numbers involved are minuscule compared with a respiratory bug like covid-19. Calculating on the basis of the number of contact-tracers used to contain the outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese city hit hardest by the country’s epidemic, public-health experts recently convened by Johns Hopkins University estimated that more than 260,000 new hires would be needed at local and state public-health departments in America—up from just 2,200 at present. To make a start, they recommend that America recruits 100,000 such new hires dedicated to covid-19. Their salaries for a year would add up to $3.6bn—a rounding error on the cost of shutting down the American economy.\nMassachusetts has begun hiring 1,000 additional contact-tracers and social workers who would support people under quarantine by shopping for food and collecting medications, for example. American universities are developing crash training courses for contact-tracers. Similar efforts are starting to appear in Europe. In March Germany’s public-health institute put out a job advertisement aimed at students for “containment scouts” to do contact-tracing; 10,000 applied. Germany plans to have at least one five-person team per 20,000 inhabitants to help with contact-tracing. In badly affected areas the army and other personnel will be called in. The Czech Republic may also use army recruits.\nApps that will help health officials track where hotspots of covid-19 may be emerging and trace the contacts of infected people are being developed (see article). Such apps are already widely used in China. They can make contact-tracing more efficient, says Anita Cicero of Johns Hopkins University, but they cannot replace the traditional methods of contact-tracing—nor the humans who do it. The European Commission, which on April 15th unveiled a “road map” to ensure that EU member-states co-ordinate the lifting of their restrictions, wants them to agree on a common framework for such an app; at the moment, many countries are forging ahead with their own plans.\nMany experts doubt that such apps, which people will have to install voluntarily, would be popular. “I don’t think Americans are going to go for that,” says Michael Fraser of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials in America. “I’ve been surprised before, though,” he concedes. If the alternative is being cooped up at home, lots may opt in. Almost two-thirds of Germans told one survey they would forgo the privacy of their data to protect the lives of others; a separate poll found that 70% of respondents would be happy to install a contact-tracing app.\nBut organising quarantines on the scale required by covid-19 would require more than just manpower and technology, notes Mr Fraser. Most of the new contact-tracers can work from home, by phone or using other technologies. Some, however, would need to go to people’s homes. For that, they would need face-masks and gloves to protect them—which are in short supply globally. At a local level, isolation facilities are needed for people who cannot isolate themselves at home. These must be safe, private and comfortable.\nAbove all, every country that wants to contain a second wave will need to test everyone suspected of being infected with covid-19 and their contacts. This will have to be rapid diagnostic testing, says Ms Cicero, where people get the results in less than an hour. Testing sites would need to be set up in every health-care facility. The way things are now in America, people often wait for their results for several days—too long for a virus that they can spread before they develop symptoms.\nTesting capacity everywhere has been growing. But at its current pace America will take months to attain the level needed for effective contact-tracing, says Mr Fraser. In many countries, the crimped global supply of materials, including reagents (chemicals necessary for tests), means that testing is reserved primarily for those hospitalised with covid-19 and health-care workers. The dearth of reagents means that Austria may not be able to increase its testing as planned, even though it has the capacity to carry out ten times the number of tests it conducts now.\nReagents are not the only thing in short supply. Swabs to take samples from patients, glass tubes, machines and trained technicians with protective masks and gloves are also scarce. With so many different inputs, bottlenecks can easily occur. And when every single country in the world needs enormous supplies, it will be a while before there is no shortage of them.\nCorona and out\nEvery plan and guideline for what a country must have in place before it lifts its lockdown puts expanded testing near the top of the list, but few outline how to do this fast. For countries hoping to be rid of both their lockdowns and a runaway covid-19 epidemic, no problem is as urgent.■\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus tracker and story hub\nThis article appeared in the International section of the print edition under the headline \"Emergency exit\""}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/04/dont-tempt-us-with-forbidden-fruit", "title": "Dont tempt us with forbidden fruit | Radio 3", "text": "Don't tempt us with forbidden fruit\nRadio 3 Breakfast Singalong | Edna O’Brien’s books that made her | Courgette conundrum | New verb | San Serriffe and coronavirus | Letter-writing professors\nYour editorial (4 May) is spot-on, except that you did not mention the Radio 3 Breakfast Singalong on Friday at 8.55am, which is now an essential part of our lockdown week.

", "text": "Any other president would see it as his or her job to model safe behavior. Trump is the president, the head of state. His mental and physical health are vital public concerns. Why is Trump continuing to act in ways that threaten himself and others?\nRead: You’re likely to get the coronavirus\nAt moments of national crisis, there is a strong instinct to support the president’s leadership. In the media, this instinct expresses itself in the impulse to suppress our knowledge of the president’s history and character, and to report on him the way we would have reported on his predecessors. But just as the president has a duty, so do we. Our duty is to describe things as they are, not as we would wish them to be. The coronavirus is a powerful force, but it is not powerful enough to transmute Donald Trump into a different person from the one he was before the crisis.\nSo when we talk about the president and his protracted refusal to test, we should not write about that decision as if the president who were refusing the test were a figure from Mount Rushmore. It’s Trump. Why did he delay such an urgent health precaution for so long?\nFive reasons based on hard experience come to mind.\n- Donald Trump is a fearful person. He is terrified of sharks. He is especially fearful of disease and death. He banished his chief of staff from the room for coughing. He told a German magazine in 2007 that he would not go near his own children when they were sick. Any medical test is an encounter with mortality. By refusing to look, the encounter is avoided—or postponed. Private citizen Trump hired oddball doctors who assured him that he was in fabulous condition when he obviously was not. President Trump promoted a White House doctor who suggested that Trump might possibly live to 200 given his “fabulous genes.” It’s plausible that Trump doesn’t want to be tested for fear of being told otherwise.\n- Pro-Trump propaganda depicts the president as muscular and virile. He himself retweeted a meme of his face Photoshopped onto the body of a young Sylvester Stallone. In fact, Trump is obese and rarely exercises beyond hitting a golf ball. A test that revealed illness would pierce the Trump image in ways intolerable to the president. The experience of illness is a humbling one. The ill person tumbles out of a universe of self-sufficiency into another, where he or she must depend on the care of others. But Trump sees himself as always in control, always in command. Better not to know.\n- Coronavirus tests are in desperately short supply because of Trump’s own negligence and that of his administration. He squandered preparation time because of his own characteristic defects as a manager, most notably his insatiable need for validation and flattery. Trump taking a coronavirus test would remind an anxious country that tests are available only for some, and not others. For Trump to cut to the head of the queue would remind everybody that it is his fault the queue is so long.\n- Trump’s supreme priority as president has always been to make as much money as he can out of his hotels and resorts. One of his first acts as president was to double the initiation fee at Mar-a-Lago, from $100,000 to $200,000. People willingly paid because Trump dispensed so many rewards to his customers, including ambassadorships of South Africa and the Dominican Republic. But if Trump got sick, it is quite possible he got sick at Mar-a-Lago. What happens to Trump’s resort business if Mar-a-Lago is revealed as a plague spot, a disease epicenter? Business will collapse, and Trump’s personal finances will be hit.\n- Even when nonlethal, COVID-19 can inflict debilitating suffering on those who succumb. Serious cases must be put on artificial respiration. They may be racked with diarrhea. Organs may fail too. COVID-19 patients can be in the hospital for weeks or even a month before they fully recover. The risk seems greatest for men over 70, with obesity as an additional risk factor—Trump’s exact medical profile."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/3232c6271ee4ad068c683d6e6354beef", "title": "Thailand prepares tough measures to control spread of virus", "text": "Thailand prepares tough measures to control spread of virus\nBANGKOK (AP) — Thai authorities say they are taking steps to wield emergency legal powers to control the spread of the new virus and limit its economic and social impact.\nPublic Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said Monday the National Committee on Communicable Disease has endorsed adding COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, to a list of 13 other dangerous communicable diseases.\nThe endorsement is expected to be quickly implemented.

In combination with the normal, October-through-March flu season, the disease could strain hospital capacity even more than it did this spring, when flu season was petering out. “It’s going to be a very difficult fall and winter this year coming up,” says Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.\nScientists don’t yet know if the coronavirus will fade away during the summer before making a resurgence in colder temperatures.

A video went viral a few weeks back showing students partying it up on a Miami beach, despite government guidance to socially distance from one another. One student, Brady Sluder, even justified himself to CBS, saying: “If I get corona, I get corona, at the end of the day I’m not gonna let it stop me from partying.”\nIt now turns out the students are feeling pretty bad about it. Sluder has taken to Instagram to apologize publicly, while others have expressed regret over the implications that their actions could now have on loved ones.\nMeanwhile, the University of Tampa confirmed that at least five of its students tested positive after returning from spring break.\nRon Paul may have to stop denying the virus, since his son has it\nOn 16 March, the former Texas congressman Ron Paul wrote an articled titled: The Coronavirus Hoax. In the article, he accused Democrats of using the coronavirus to “grab more power and authority in the name of fighting a virus that thus far has killed less than 100 Americans”.\nSix days later, his son Rand Paul became the first US senator to test positive for Covid-19. It isn’t fair that his son should suffer for his sins, but at least we can hope the news has encouraged Ron Paul to take the pandemic a little more seriously.\nThen again, Rand Paul was still hitting the gym and swimming in the Senate pool while awaiting his results, so maybe that’s a little too hopeful.\nA toilet-licking influencer is left with a bad taste\nIt is not confirmed that this TikTok influencer’s coronavirus was contracted the moment that he decided to lick a toilet seat, but I am going to take a punt and suggest that it wasn’t the best thing he could have done.\nThe influencer, known as Larz, posted footage of himself in a hospital bed on Sunday, according to the Daily Mail, confirming that he has tested positive for the virus.\nHe had licked the public toilet as part of a social media challenge called “Coronavirus Challenge” which is about as dumb as it sounds, and involves licking stuff, like produce at the grocery store, for reasons unknown to me.\nLarz was criticised for engaging in the challenge on a chatshow last week. On the show, he also said that he doesn’t talk to his mom because she doesn’t have enough followers.

That’s, of course, an important impact for the French economy,” French finance minister Bruno le Maire said.\nAirlines are already feeling the impact after many cancelled all flights to mainland China. The International Air Transport Association estimated that Asian-Pacific carriers could lose an estimated $27.8 billion (€25 billion) in 2020.\nIf it hinders airlines having a normal summer operation, \"then it will have a significant implication, not just for us, but also for the industry as a whole,\" Scandinavian Airlines CEO Rickard Gustafson told CNBC.\nLufthansa announced measures to lower costs after sustaining losses from cutting flights to China.\nChina influences the global economy\nThe EU's economic commissioner told Euronews earlier this month that the longer the duration of the epidemic, the harder the impact of it, will be, especially because as China is such a large player in the world's economy.\n\"The importance of the Chinese economy in the global economy it’s enormously changed since the last epidemic that we had in 2003 that was the SARS epidemic. The Chinese economy was at the time 4% of the global economy, it is now almost 18% of the global economy,\" said economic commissioner Paolo Gentiloni.\n\"So if we have a problem in China, we will have spillover of this problem on supply chains of manufacture on travel on tourism [and] on other sectors.\"\nThis could include \"generic products for pharmacies, electronic components, smartphones, and automotive parts.

But the coronavirus pandemic has crippled the nation and the world, taking more than 40,000 American lives, tanking the American economy, and rendering at least 22 million people jobless since Trump declared a national emergency in March.\nNow, as the Trump re-election campaign heads into its final seven months with former Vice President Joe Biden as the presumptive Democratic nominee, the message of why voters should re-elect President Trump is adjusting to that grim reality. Faced with a historic crisis that undermines Trump’s prior bragging about the economy and America’s place in the world, Trump and his campaign are trying to shift blame for the crisis fallout away from the President and hoping Americans will still view him as the best candidate to lead the country’s comeback.\n“The American economy under President Trump’s leadership reached unprecedented heights, before it was artificially interrupted by the coronavirus,” says Tim Murtaugh, the campaign’s communications director. “He built it to incredible heights once, and he will do it a second time.”\nThe recalibration is no small job for a campaign that was initially focused on a prospering economy. The stock market took a precipitous plunge in the early days of the outbreak, and the country is facing a level of job loss not seen since the Great Depression.\nKeep up to date on the growing threat to global health by signing up for our daily coronavirus newsletter.\nTrump “was the first President to keep pointing at the Dow and saying, ‘I did this, yeah, I’m responsible,’” says Timothy Naftali, a historian at New York University. Previous modern presidents steered clear, worried that taking credit for the rise of the Dow Jones Industrial Average would mean pinning their legacy to the vicissitudes of the stock market, which goes up and down for reasons often beyond the actions of the President, Naftali says. “Now the President looks at the Dow, and if he were to ask people, are you better off now than you were four years ago, the answer wouldn’t please him, nor would it please the American people.”\nRelated Stories\nThere’s some evidence that that the American people are souring on Trump already: a Gallup poll from mid-April found that Trump’s approval rating had dropped six points since March to 43%, the sharpest drop that poll had recorded in Trump’s presidency so far. A new NBC News/WSJ poll from mid-April shows Biden leading Trump by 7 points nationally among registered voters, 49 to 42%, in the presidential race. A Real Clear Politics polling average has Biden leading Trump 48.3% to 42.5%\nThe Trump Administration has faced sharp criticism for fumbling the early response to the crisis, with costly mistakes in creating widely available, functional tests for the virus and an unexplained delay in further actions that could have been taken in the weeks after Trump initially banned travel from China. “What he’s trying to do is reframe this crisis so that the American people will forget that it is worse than it had to be, that he misunderstood the challenge, that he bungled the implementation of the response,” says Naftali.\nUltimately, Trump’s campaign doesn’t think voters will blame the president for the country’s new economic woes, and hopes voters will only credit him for the economic highs. “You can’t fault him,” a campaign official says of blaming Trump for the economic crisis, using the same phrase as Murtaugh, that the economy was ‘artificially interrupted.’ “During the coronavirus, the American people want to see the president leading, and that’s what they’re seeing with President Trump,” says Erin Perrine, principal deputy communications director for the Trump campaign. “We’re going to continue to tout that.”\nThe White House shares the campaign’s view that, so far, Americans may not be holding Trump accountable for their economic troubles and will instead focus on what he’s doing to move forward. “The President doesn’t seem to own the negative economic outcome from this unprecedented global pandemic,” a White House official says, adding that “he would have owned the negative health outcomes, if he had opened up” the economy too soon. The push to reopen the country quickly “presumed that the economy is still the number one issue going into the election,” the official says, “when the handling of coronavirus is.”\nAs the campaign focuses on a promise of economic revival and Trump’s coronavirus response, they’re also beginning to launch attacks on Biden that could resonate during the pandemic. Murtaugh says they will continue to draw distinctions with Biden on the standard campaign issues, including health care policy, energy policy, tax policy and Second Amendment views. But, “there’s no question that a prominent issue is going to be the coronavirus,” Murtaugh says.\nMurtaugh and another campaign official tell TIME they plan to highlight Biden’s “coziness with China,” as the official puts it. Both officials note Biden’s previous support for trade with China and the business ties his son, Hunter Biden, has to the country, as well his Biden’s initial criticism of Trump’s decision to halt travel from China. The travel ban from China is one of the moves Trump often talks about as a crucial decision he made to manage the spread of the virus in the U.S. “Our internal data shows that Joe Biden’s softness on China is a major vulnerability, among many,” Murtaugh says.\nBoth campaign and White House staff say they think the best contrast Trump can draw with Biden is to keep promoting the work he and the federal government are doing. “He is doing things only a president can do,” says Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president and Trump’s former campaign manager in 2016, citing things like invoking the Defense Production Act, hosting other world leaders on calls, implementing travel restrictions on China and working with state governors to deploy supplies. “In this building, we don’t have time to talk about Bernie [Sanders] or Biden,” Conway says. “We’re talking about ventilators and vaccines.”\nThe mechanics of how the Trump campaign is able to get its retooled messaging out has needed to change as well. The huge rallies in multi-thousand seat arenas that have always been a staple of Donald Trump’s campaigns are now prohibited by the public health guidelines governing the coronavirus mitigation efforts. The campaign insists Trump will be back to holding rallies sometime before the election. “This coronavirus will pass and the president is looking forward to getting back out on the campaign trail and holding rallies,” Murtaugh said in a statement. “Never fear, the President is certain that we’re going to be back out there speaking directly to the American people.”\nThat may or may not come to pass for public health reasons, and Trump has said he doesn’t like the look or feel of arenas and large crowds at partial capacity for social distancing measures. “I don’t like the rallies where we’re sitting like you’re sitting,” Trump said during an April 17 coronavirus task force briefing, referring to journalists seated apart for social distancing. “It loses, to me, a lot of flavor. But I hope we’re going to have rallies. I think they’re going to be bigger than ever.”\nUntil then, the campaign has been relying on its network of volunteers to make calls to prospective voters from their own homes in a program called “Trump Talk,” in which they “are not only encouraging people to re-elect the President but we are asking people to visit Coronavirus.Gov for important resources and to learn about what they can do to flatten the curve,” Ali Pardo, deputy communications director for the campaign, told TIME in a March 27 statement.\nIn total, the campaign says it has nearly 1,000 staffers and 550,000 trained volunteers across the country now working in the new virtual campaign infrastructure, making calls and working to register new voters online. “The Trump Campaign has a significant advantage because of our early and ongoing investment in data and technological infrastructure that began in 2015,” said Pardo.\nAt least one key tenet of the campaign has stayed the same since before the pandemic: Trump still takes the lead on the message he wants to present. He has always campaigned largely by instinct, and the campaign insists that’s no different, even during this temporary pause in rallies, which is where he often tests out new slogans or ideas. In some ways, the near daily coronavirus task force briefings at the White House have become Trump’s substitute for his rallies in his ability to command airwaves and speak without a filter to the American people, though the briefings lack the direct contact with enthusiastic supporters he enjoys.\nSometimes the campaign’s reliance on Trump’s gut can lead it into dicey territory, as when Trump recently tweeted support to “liberate” certain states where protesters have pushed back against public health economic lockdowns. Fomenting protest is a well-worn instinct for Trump, but a Politico/Morning Consult poll from last week found that 81% of Americans disagree with the protestors’ position, saying the United States “should continue to social distance for as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus, even if it means continued damage to the economy.” And Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, warned Monday that those protests will “backfire” and delay the economic reopening even further.\nWhen asked about Trump’s tweets, a campaign official doubled down: “The president’s message is the one that we support.”\nIn isolation, Trump as an instinctual campaigner could risk falling out of touch with a country that has fundamentally changed in the space of a few short months. “They’d rather not have me travel,” Trump said on April 17. “I think I’ve been in the White House, I don’t know, for months,” except for one trip to Virginia on March 28. “I don’t know what it is,” the president lamented of how long he’s been stuck in the White House.\nTrump used to poll rally audiences about slogans he was testing out, asking for cheers to signal approval for phrases like “Make America Great Again” or a switch to “Keep America Great.” Standing at the podium at his daily briefings won’t give Trump the same kind of feedback he’s relied on in the past. Many voters may not feel that America is doing “great” by the time they head to the general election polls in November, particularly as the pandemic’s death toll is projected to keep climbing. The government estimates that more than 100,000 people could die from COVID-19 before the crisis is over.\nFor now, the campaign says, they’re sticking with “Keep America Great” — unless and until President Trump says otherwise. “How the president brands the campaign is completely up to him,” a campaign official says. “We all know he is the best campaign manager, best communications director, and best advocate for himself that’s out there.”\n—With reporting by Brian Bennett/Washington\nPlease send tips, leads, and stories from the frontlines to virus@time.com."}, {"url": "https://time.com/magazine/us/5822291/april-27th-2020-vol-1-no-1-asia-europe-middle-east-and-africa-north-america-south-america-south-pacific-u-s/", "title": "April 27th , 2020 | Vol . 1 , No . 1 | Asia , Europe , Middle East , and Africa , North America , South America , South Pacific , U .

Jennifer Lopez had performed, and members of Congress mingled with Oscar winners, astronauts with activists, CEOs with artists. “I had a great time,” he said. “But you have all these influential people. That’s an extraordinary opportunity. What are you going to do with it?”\nThe answer to that question became one of the most important initiatives we’ve launched over the past year, expanding the TIME 100 franchise from an annual list of the world’s most influential people into a global leadership community. We reached out to hundreds of TIME 100 alumni from across the years and around the world, inviting them to find ways to collaborate. Last fall, for the first-ever TIME 100 Health Summit, we gathered a group—ranging from former President Bill Clinton to the three highest-ranking health officials in the Trump Administration to the leaders of major health systems—to focus deeply on the search, as we put it then, “for a better, healthier world.”\nLittle did we know, of course, that a few months later the entire world would find itself singularly focused on that very search. And so for this issue, which we had planned as our annual TIME 100, we instead asked members of our TIME 100 community for insights and perspectives on some of the challenges we are all facing in navigating the new realities of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMore than 50 of them agreed to be part of this special issue. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen writes about the steps her nation took to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus (it has fewer than 400 confirmed cases as of April 14) and offers to help other countries stem future outbreaks. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai predicts this crisis will permanently change the way we work, with more flexibility to be remote and more urgency around access to broadband Internet. Former Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev, who helped guide the world into a period of collaboration that seems unimaginable today, argues for rethinking the entire concept of global security to emphasize human health. Throughout these contributions, notes Dan Macsai, editorial director of the TIME 100, who oversaw the issue, “there is an underlying message of resilience and hope.”\nIt’s a message the artist JR, a 2018 TIME 100 honoree, captures powerfully on the cover.\nWhat, we wondered, does it mean to be a public artist when there is no public? JR, who had the coronavirus himself weeks ago and has recovered, embraced that challenge, creating a 15-by-21-ft. artwork that he pasted in strips on the pavement of an empty Paris street on April 11 and then photographed from a window above. As with his epic installation at the Louvre Museum in 2016, JR used an anamorphic image, meaning it is seen best from the angle from which the photograph is taken. “I’m a strong believer in miracles,” JR says. “It’s a small virus with big consequences. But we can come to the end of it.”\nThe TIME 100 has always been a mirror of the world and the people who shape it. And as our world now looks far different than we expected, so too will our annual TIME 100 list and issue when it appears in the fall.\nHere’s hoping that world is a better and healthier one.\nThis article is part of a special series on how the coronavirus is changing our lives, with insights and advice from the TIME 100 community.
