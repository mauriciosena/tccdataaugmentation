That’s when it all became very real. I had just played my first basketball game in months the night before, and conversations were swirling about what this virus might mean for the league. That night, I started to feel sick. The fever set in. First at 100. Then 101. My first thought was, “What are the chances? Could this really happen?” After months of waiting to get back on the court following a broken hand and two surgeries, I just wanted to play. But the threat of this mystery virus locked me in my bedroom to protect everyone I cared about: wife, kids, teammates, fans.\nI was the first NBA player tested for COVID-19. Thankfully, my test came back negative. But that experience hit me, and it hit me hard. I’m fortunate to have the job I do, and not have to worry about all the many things crippling families across the country during this pandemic: unemployment, hunger, housing. How couldn’t I use all of my resources and the full power of the platform my wife and I have built to help those desperately in need during this time? We have a responsibility to one another.\nMy wife Ayesha frequently says, “Be the village to help people who are in need,” and that’s what we’re trying to do. Oakland, Calif., has been our beloved city for more than 10 years—and its community welcomed us with open arms since day one. Before this crisis, about 20% of local residents, including many children, were struggling with food insecurity (a challenge Ayesha has been passionate about for years). But now, with schools closed and unemployment on the rise, food insecurity threatens to soar to unprecedented levels. With every photo of the never-ending lines at food banks across the country, we are reminded of the harsh reality of life today for Americans.\nSo much of the work we’re doing during the COVID-19 pandemic is to ensure that every resident in Oakland has access to the food they need. From the moment Oakland schools announced indefinite closures, our Eat. Learn. Play. foundation has played a crucial role in providing more than 1 million meals to Oakland kids and families. Going forward, we’re committed to helping provide nearly 300,000 meals every week to Oakland residents for the next several months, alongside our dedicated partners at the Oakland Unified School District, Alameda County Community Food Bank and chef José Andrés’ World Central Kitchen. Our work with World Central Kitchen has meant reopening more than a dozen Oakland restaurants to prepare nutritious meals for many of Oakland’s most vulnerable residents, including the elderly and homeless populations, and low-income families most at risk.\nWe have a unique opportunity to come together, to bridge humanity; and the future of our world depends on what you do next. Whether it’s giving blood, donating to your local food bank, checking in on your elderly neighbors or just staying home, our small gestures in times of crisis can end up being the big gestures that made the difference.\nCurry is a guard for the Golden State Warriors and two-time NBA MVP"}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/06/russian-regions-crowded-queues-spark-coronavirus-concern-a69888", "title": "Russian Region Crowded Queues Spark Coronavirus Concern", "text": "As Russia's regional governments have been given the freedom to apply their own approaches to coronavirus quarantine, the methods they employ have raised widespread concern.\nIn the Saratov region, long, dense lines of people waited for special work passes, while in Kaliningrad a horde of people gathered in front of an immigration office.\nThis ignores Russia's consumer health watchdog's guideline to stay at a minimum of 1.5-2 meters apart from one another in order to minimize the risk of contracting Covid-19."}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/23/moscow-halts-abortions-during-coronavirus-outbreak-activists-a70082", "title": "Moscow Halts Abortions During Coronavirus Outbreak : Activists", "text": "More than 100,000 pregnant women will be unable to undergo medical abortions in Moscow because of restrictions during the coronavirus outbreak, the women’s rights organization Nasiliyu.net (“No to Violence”) Center has said.\nOnly three out of the Russian capital’s 44 clinics have said they would continue to provide abortions through the national compulsory medical insurance program, the group said on its website Monday.

(AP) — Officials in Two New Mexico counties and rural residents are standing up against a proposed transmission line that would connect the potential for more wind farms with markets in other western states.\nThe five-member Valencia County Commission voted unanimously in January to oppose the Western Spirit Transmission Line. The commissioners were backed by landowners and residents who fears the project’s huge towers and miles of high-voltage lines will spoil their rural quality of life by obstructing pristine vistas, impacting wildlife and undermining tourism-related income and property values.\nThe Socorro County Commission also voted unanimously in September to oppose the project for similar reasons.\nThe state’s Renewable Energy Transmission Authority and Pattern Development are jointly building the 150=mile (241.40 kilometers) line. Expected to be operating next year, it will carry more than 800 megawatts of electricity from wind farms — still under construction by Pattern in central New Mexico — for sale in western states.\nWestern Spirit is the second major transmission line to face such opposition, following pushback against the SunZia Southwest Transmission Project. That 520-miles(837 kilometers) line being developed by another company would carry three gigawatts of wind energy from central New Mexico to Arizona, crossing between wildlife refuges along the Rio Grande.\nSunZia must still navigate significant regulatory hurdles, but Western Spirit has received the federal and state permits it needs. Still, developers must negotiate right-of-way agreements with local landowners in Valencia and Socorro counties, and some are holding out.\nThe Albuquerque Journal reports that some critics are worried about possible interference with activity at the Belen Regional Airport.\n“We don’t really see any options that county commissioners can pursue to stop it,” said Valencia County Manager Danny Monette. “But commissioners wanted to be on the record that they stand with county residents who oppose the project. We want to make sure our citizens’ voices are heard.”\nThe Renewable Energy Transmission Authority has been working since 2010 to construct the Western Spirit line. RETA owns the rights to the project.\nPattern will construct the line, A global wind developer, Pattern already operates 550 MW of wind farms near Clovis that supply utilities in California and elsewhere.\nThe company says Western Spirit and the associated wind energy it’s developing represent a nearly $1.5 billion investment, including about $360 million for the transmission line. The company predicts tens of millions in tax revenue, landowner lease payments and salaries.\nPattern is also the anchor tenant for the SunZia line. It’s planning nearly a dozen more wind farms near Corona to supply 2.2 GW of electricity to western markets through SunZia.\nRETA Executive Director Fernando Martínez said Western Spirit and projects like SunZia are needed to open up the wind energy potential in central and eastern New Mexico.\n“Without the transmission, our renewable energy remains stranded,” Martínez said.\nPublic Service Co. of New Mexico, the state’s largest electric provider, also would benefit. The utility needs the infrastructure, not just to accommodate wind developers who export electricity to other states, but for the utility to meet mandates under the state’s Energy Transition Act, which requires all electricity to be derived from carbon-free resources by 2045.\nPNM says its current transmission is too congested to add more wind from the eastern plains.\nLandowners in and around Bosque, where Western Spirit will cross the Rio Grande, have organized in opposition to Western Spirit. The group, led by women whose families live alongside or near the river, launched a neighborhood petition and have met with government officials and Pattern representatives.\nThe project will impact 340 tracts of land in three counties. It begins at PNM’s existing main line near Clines Corners in Torrance County. From there, it runs south toward Corona, then west to the Rio Grande, and finally back north again to PNM’s substation west of Albuquerque.\nThe developers have reached agreements with most landowners, Martínez said.\nOpponents say many landowners have granted rights of way because they fear RETA could exercise its power of eminent domain. Martínez said RETA would only consider that as a last resort.\n“With so many tracts of land, it’s not an easy task to get everyone in agreement,” Martínez said. “But to have reached agreement with 91%, we feel good about that.”"}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/freedom-of-speech-award-fact-checkers-fighting-the-infodemic-in-times-of-covid-19/a-53307451", "title": "Freedom of Speech Award : Fact - checkers fighting the infodemic in times of COVID - 19 | Press Releases | DW", "text": "DW Director General Peter Limbourg: 'The Freedom of Speech Award 2020 is dedicated to all courageous journalists worldwide who are suffering repressions because of their reporting on the pandemic'\n\"We honor all our colleagues who are being prevented by force from doing their job in these difficult times,\" DW Director General Peter Limbourg said in Berlin.\n\"Deutsche Welle is demanding that all journalists worldwide, who have been arrested because of their coverage of the COVID-19 crisis, are released immediately.\"\nDW Director General Peter Limbourg\nSince 2015, DW has presented the prize annually to a person or initiative that has shown outstanding commitment to human rights and freedom of expression in the media.

There was Father Hilary Rodgers, a 75-year-old retired priest who spent decades as a Franciscan friar. There was Lucille Williams, a mother of six who would have been 95 in May, and who had recently been crowned queen of the residence’s Mardi Gras celebration. Many of the deaths were unexpected. One nursing assistant told me that staff might check on a resident at 8 p.m. and deem her stable, only to find her dead when checking on her again at 8:30. For safety reasons, family members were not allowed into rooms to visit their sick loved ones, even as they approached death. Residents’ children and grandchildren took to standing outside the windows of the first-floor Holy Family unit, shouting conversations through the glass or holding up signs that residents could see from bed. Jack Williams, Lucille’s son, made one that said\nDad is waiting for you . He was too nervous about upsetting his sisters to use it.\nInside the home, the sisters and staff were in shock. Every time they tried to grieve the death of a resident, a new person would die. “It felt like we were robbed,” Kortenhof said. “We may have 13 deaths over a year. We had 13 deaths … over a period of three weeks,” including the 11 COVID-19–related cases and two of unrelated causes. Typically, deaths at the home are slow and gentle, with residents surrounded by family and the sisters sitting by their bedside, holding a prayer vigil in three-hour shifts. COVID-19 has taken away all the normal rituals that might happen close to the end of a resident’s life. Priests cannot visit to take confession or anoint the dying. Because COVID-19 is so contagious, the sisters have to don personal protective equipment over their habits and veils anytime they enter a sick resident’s room. “One man, I was praying with him awhile with full garb on: rubber gloves, goggles, masks, gowns,” Kortenhof said. “It’s just so unnatural for us.”\nA few weeks into the outbreak, the nuns started getting sick. Kortenhof and three other sisters went into isolation, leaving the residence with even fewer hands. She found it “torturous” to get messages about residents dying while she wasn’t there. “If you don’t have a strong faith, this thing would just succeed in crushing you,” she said.\nHoly Week passed heavily. The deaths had become a drumbeat, and the sisters and staff were exhausted. Volunteers from the nearby Christiana Hospital came to help with equipment and care, visiting residents to take their temperature and measure the oxygen in their blood. Alone in their rooms, many in the home tuned in to channel 50, a live feed of the facility’s chapel. Each morning and afternoon, sisters who were not sick would come in to pray the rosary or recite the Divine Mercy, kneeling far from one another to maintain social distance. The channel was a small thread connecting residents in isolation, a way of being together in days of solitude."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51723398", "title": "Coronavirus : Iran temporarily frees 54 , 000 prisoners to combat spread", "text": "Coronavirus: Iran temporarily frees 54,000 prisoners to combat spread\nIran has temporarily released more than 54,000 prisoners in an effort to combat the spread of the new coronavirus disease in crowded jails.\nJudiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili told reporters the inmates were allowed out of prison after testing negative for Covid-19 and posting bail.\n\"Security prisoners\" sentenced to more than five years will not be let out.\nThe jailed British-Iranian charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe may be freed soon, according to a British MP.\nTulip Siddiq cited the Iranian ambassador to the UK as saying that Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe \"may be released on furlough today or tomorrow\".\nHer husband said on Saturday that he believed she had contracted Covid-19 at Tehran's Evin prison and that authorities were refusing to test her.\nBut Mr Esmaili insisted on Monday that Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe had subsequently been in contact with her family and \"told them about her good health\".\nMs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was jailed for five years in 2016 after being convicted of espionage charges that she has denied.

To protect yourself against coronavirus you must regularly clean your hands with an alcohol-based detergent or wash them with soap and water. You should then dry them thoroughly using a paper towel or wind-dryer.\nAre antibiotics effective in preventing and treating COVID-19?\nNo. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.\nCan the radiation of disinfection lamps kill COVID-19?\nUV lamps should not be used to sterilise hands or other parts of the human body because UV can cause skin irritation.\nHow effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with COVID-19?\nThermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever due to a COVID-19 infection, but cannot detect infected people who do not have a fever yet. This is why people with coronavirus develop a fever within two to three days.\nCan spraying alcohol or chlorine on the body eliminate the COVID-19?\nNo. Spraying alcohol or chlorine on your organs cannot kill the virus that has just entered your body. Spraying such substances can damage clothing or mucous membranes of the body, such as the eyes and mouth. Alcohol and chlorine can be useful for disinfecting surfaces but should be used according to specific recommendations and guidelines.\nIs it safe to receive a letter or parcel from China?\nYes, it is safe. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.\nCan I catch COVID-19 from my pet?\nCurrently, there is no evidence that pets, such as dogs or cats, can be infected with the virus. But it is always best to wash your hands with soap and water after each contact with pets. This protects you against the common bacterias between pets and humans.\nDo vaccines against pneumonia protect you against COVID-19?\nNo. These vaccines do not work against it. Of course, researchers around the world are working to discover and develop the coronavirus vaccine. However, the World Health Organization strongly recommends vaccination against respiratory illnesses to protect your health.\nCan regular nasal washing with salt prevent the virus?\nNo. There is no evidence that salt is prevented from regularly washing the nose with coronavirus or lung infection. Limited evidence, however, suggests that regular nasal washings with salt can help with a faster recovery of the common cold.\nCan eating garlic help prevent the infection?\nGarlic is a useful nutrient that may have antimicrobial activity. However, there is no reason to believe it has protected people from developing coronavirus.\nDoes rubbing sesame oil on the skin prevent COVID-19 from entering the body?\nSesame oil does not kill the coronavirus. Of course, some chemical products exist such as bleach or chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid and chloroform - which are useful for removing bacterias in general. But their function is only to cleanse surfaces. It has no significant effect but is also dangerous.\nAre there any specific medicines for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19?\nTo date, no specific medication is recommended. Patients with the virus should now be under full medical care, and regular clinical examinations should provide them with some special treatments. The World Health Organization is working to speed up ongoing research to discover the drug for coronavirus.\nAre only older people affected by the virus?\nPeople of all ages can contract COVID-19. But the elderly and those with a history of diseases such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease are more vulnerable to the virus.\nThe World Health Organization recommends that everyone of all ages should follow personal hygiene instructions to protect themselves against the spreading. People with the virus should also avoid smoking and avoid using prescriptions."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51677846", "title": "Coronavirus : British man who was on Diamond Princess ship dies in Japan", "text": "Coronavirus: British man who was on Diamond Princess ship dies in Japan\nA British man has become the first UK citizen to die from coronavirus after being infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.\nHe is the sixth passenger to die from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, Japan's health ministry said.\nAnother person has tested positive for the virus in England, which they caught in the UK.\nThe total number of coronavirus cases in the UK now stands at 20.\nConfirming the latest UK case, Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said: \"It is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an individual who had recently returned from abroad.\"\nThe patient has been transferred to a specialist NHS infection centre at Guy's and St Thomas' in London.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, who is due to chair an emergency Cobra committee meeting on Monday, said preparing for an outbreak in the UK was now the government's \"top priority\".\nSpeaking from Downing Street on Friday evening, Mr Johnson offered his condolences to the family of the British man who died from Covid-19.\nWhen asked if the government should have acted sooner for Britons on the cruise ship, he said it had been following the \"best medical advice\" about not repatriating people unless it is certain there will not be a spread to the UK.\nMr Johnson has also faced criticism from Labour for waiting until Monday to hold the government Cobra meeting.\nBut he said he had been working behind the scenes, meeting with the health secretary and chief medical officers to discuss the NHS's preparations.\nHundreds of people on board the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship became infected while it was held in quarantine off the port of Yokohama earlier this month.\nA group of 30 British nationals and two Irish citizens were flown back to the UK from the cruise liner last Saturday.\nThey were taken on coaches to Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, where they are spending two weeks in isolation.\nHowever, some UK passengers were critical of the Foreign Office's \"slow\" response, and said the wait for repatriation had been \"frustrating\".\nAmong them were David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, who were not on the evacuation flight after testing positive for the coronavirus.

In a rare partnership with Apple, the company is working to turn smartphones into contact-tracing devices, on an opt-in basis, to help notify people if they’ve been exposed to the virus. More than 1,000 Google staffers have also volunteered to work on virus testing and screening programs run by Verily, Alphabet’s life sciences wing. Here, edited excerpts from TIME’s conversation with CEO Sundar Pichai about how he’s navigating this new landscape.\nYou’ve talked, as many innovators have, about crises being spurs to innovation. What does that look like right now? Google was founded right before the dotcom crash and built in a moment of severe, I would say, scarcity. That inspired us to solve problems with constraints. And be it distance learning, delivery—I think this moment will make people think creatively and think ahead.\nIt also seems as if there has been increasing collaboration between Alphabet and other tech companies, which might be competitors under different circumstances. Absolutely. When I talk to other leaders, there is a clear sense that this is something larger than all of us. We already have established protocols to work together—for example, around [combatting] child abuse. So we are relying on those pathways for coronavirus.\nYou recently announced a partnership with Apple to build contact-tracing software for people’s smartphones, which could notify them if they have recently encountered someone who tested positive for COVID-19. While that technology could stem future outbreaks, it also raises privacy concerns. How are you dealing with that? By putting privacy first. It’s up to the user to decide to consent. It’s transparent. They can choose whether to use it or not. And there’s no personally identifiable information or location data coming to Apple and Google as part of this.\nWe are now living through what the World Health Organization calls an “infodemic”—a deluge of misinformation, spreading mostly online, that competes with real news about COVID-19. How do you fight something like that? For me, supporting trustworthy institutions and sources has always been critical. In some ways, that’s easier right now because there is a shared sense of what is objectively right. And you can look to scientists, you can look to health authorities, and that helps you converge on facts.\nAt the same time, major platforms, including Google and YouTube, have had to rely more on AI to police content, especially as they figure out how to have human moderators work from home. Could that make it easier for bad information to get through? It’s a risk. But we are being more conservative too, in the sense that, early on, we prioritized information on Google and YouTube from what we call authoritative sources: health organizations, journalistic organizations and so on. We did not allow ads related to the coronavirus for a while, because we weren’t sure of our ability to moderate the content. But as we were able to get into a better work-from-home process, we’ve been turning the dials up—which is important, by the way. You want to give more people a voice.\nThis pandemic has hit local news organizations especially hard, which could potentially leave communities without access to reliable information. Are you thinking about ways Alphabet could help? We are working on some programs to support them with grants, as we have historically through our Google News initiative. But we need to figure out healthy sustainable journalism at the local level, and there’s more work to be done.\nKeep up to date on the growing threat to global health by signing up for our daily coronavirus newsletter.\nAt one of his first coronavirus briefings, President Trump announced that Google was going to build a resource to help people find testing sites. Then reports emerged Google wasn’t fully aware of that plan. What happened? We were already working on providing more information about COVID, including about screening and testing. So we took that as an opportunity to engage closely.\nDoes it worry you that businesses are being asked to play roles that were once the purview of governments? I think technology and technology companies can play a significant role [in combatting COVID-19], and that’s the role we’re looking to play. But I wouldn’t get carried away with it. The roles are very clear. It’s up to governments and public-health organizations [to lead the response to this crisis].\nAccording to a recent Gallup-Knight survey, 77% of Americans believe that tech companies like Alphabet have too much power. What do you make of that? I think large companies have seen a lot of growth over the past few years. So it’s a natural moment in time for that to be scrutinized. What it means to me is we, as a company, have to make sure we are doing good in society—whether it’s helping companies and schools stay connected or committing a $250 million ad grant to help organizations like the WHO disseminate important information on COVID-19. And I think that’s a test we will have to pass over and over again.\nMuch has been made, understandably, about the physical-health threat of COVID-19. Are you worried about a mental-health crisis as well, particularly among your employees? Absolutely. When I do an all-hands meeting or I get emails from employees, I can see that there are people who are dealing with isolation and loneliness. Or they’re affected because some of their family members have been really affected and they cannot be with them. I see that through my children at school. And while we say that the virus affects all of humanity, data shows it affects certain people disproportionately, such as the African-American community here in the U.S. So mental health is definitely going to be an issue coming out of this. And it’s something we all have to address more.\nHow do you think this crisis will change the way we work? Will more of us be remote? I think the reason we are able to work from home effectively is because we’ve done it face to face before. We built a foundation. And we need that foundation on a continual basis. I think it’s part of human nature. Having said that, can we do things more flexibly? Absolutely. When I look at the extent to which people commute and the toll it takes on their families and so on and so forth, I think we can come up with better solutions.\nNot everyone has access to the same at-home technology and Internet service, which puts certain workers—and students—at a serious disadvantage. How do we bridge that gap? We have several projects under way, including a partnership with California Governor Gavin Newsom and T-Mobile to get wi-fi hot spots and Chromebooks to under-served communities and school districts here in California. And I think when the U.S. talks about infrastructure, there’s got to be a clear plan to provide both broadband and wireless connectivity to rural places and underserved communities.\nWhat, if anything, gives you hope that some good might come out of all this? Collective action is the most powerful resource we have, and it’s actually working. Yes, there are issues, but there is more coordination than not. How do we prevent future pandemics? How do we solve climate change? How do we tackle AI safety? All of them will involve us coming together in some way or other. And that’s what gives me hope for the next generation.\nGibbs, a former writer and editor in chief at TIME, is the director of the Shorenstein Center and the visiting Edward R.

In the information universe he has formed, COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is no worse than the seasonal flu; criticism of his response to it is a “hoax”; and media coverage of the virus is part of a political conspiracy to destroy his presidency.\nAs with so much of the president’s messaging, this narrative began with tossed-off tweets and impromptu public statements. But in recent days, as U.S. health officials have raised growing concerns about the outbreak, Trump’s efforts to play down the pandemic have been amplified by the same multi-platform propaganda apparatus he’s relying on for reelection in November. From the White House communications office to the MAGA meme warriors of Instagram, from the prime-time partisans on Fox News to the Trump campaign’s Facebook feed, the overarching message has been the same: Pay no attention to the fake-news fearmongering about the coronavirus. It’s all political hype. Things are going great.\nFact-checkers and scientists have scrambled to correct the misinformation coming out of the White House. (No, the virus has not been “contained” in America; no, testing is not available to anybody who wants it; no, people shouldn’t go to work if they’re sick.)

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has pledged to allocate approximately 20,000 hospital beds for Covid-19 patients as hospitalizations spiked in the week starting April 20.\n— Of Russia’s 800,000 regular hospital beds, 15% could be quickly transformed into intensive care facilities, according to Yury Krestinsky, who previously worked in the Health Ministry and now leads Sberbank’s healthcare business. That means 120,000 patients with more serious conditions could be treated at one time.\n— Moscow’s Health Department warned in mid-April that the city could run out of intensive care beds within two weeks. Only 57 of the city’s 248 hospitals are authorized to take in coronavirus patients so far.\n— Moscow is treating mild Covid-19 cases at home, with doctors advising patients over video calls.\n— Health officials have authorized doctors across Russia to diagnose coronavirus without lab tests after reported studies showed a high rate of false negative test results. About half of Russia’s Covid-19 cases are asymptomatic, according to officials.\n— Russia’s bed shortage endangers the lives of thousands of patients with rare diseases including hepatitis and HIV, advocacy groups warn.\nProblems\nLack of ventilators.\n- Russia has a total of around 42,000-43,000 ventilators in its state hospitals nationwide — an average of about 29 ventilators per 100,000 residents, according to figures shared with The Moscow Times by Russia’s state tender monitor Headway Group.\n- About 25% of these ventilators are located in Moscow, the Moscow region and St. Petersburg.\n- While some of Russia’s wealthiest citizens are believed to be buying up and hoarding ventilators, some hospitals in less affluent parts of the country have been supplied with ventilators that expired more than 15 years ago.\n- Doctors’ concerns about the quality of Russian-produced equipment used in hospitals have grown in recent years, a Moscow-based pulmonologist told The Moscow Times.\n- Last summer a dozen Russian healthcare NGOs wrote to President Vladimir Putin urging him to reconsider a proposed ban on importing some kinds of ventilators from abroad. The letter went unanswered, one of the signatories told The Moscow Times, and the ban ultimately came into force.\n- Officials say Russia currently has two domestic ventilator manufacturers, both based in the central city of Yekaterinburg.\nLack of personal protective equipment (PPE).\n- Putin acknowledged shortages of protective equipment for medical personnel in mid-April.

Critics say the policy was driven by corrupt practices and has seen hundreds of hospitals closed and thousands of medical jobs axed nationwide with little gained.\n- Between the beginning of 2013 and the end of 2019, Russia more than halved medical staff including junior nurses and orderlies, and cut fully fledged nursing staff by 9.3%.\n- Since 2011, Moscow has also reportedly cut nearly 2,200 infectious disease treatment beds.\n- Russia’s wider defensive policies have also undermined its health system, experts, professionals and NGOs say. Moscow has stepped up its medical import substitution drive in recent years, tightening the screws on what equipment and medicines hospitals and pharmacies can buy from abroad as recently as summer 2019.\n- Since the coronavirus outbreak emerged, the government has mobilized additional healthcare workers, recruiting medical school teachers, researchers and post-graduate medical students and providing 1.1 million medics with additional online courses.\nAFP contributed reporting."}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/12/majority-of-chinas-new-coronavirus-cases-imported-from-russia-a69957", "title": "Majority of China New Coronavirus Cases Imported From Russia", "text": "More than half of China's coronavirus infections reported on Sunday originated from a Russian flight to Shanghai the day before, a potential sign of the severity of Russia's outbreak, Bloomberg reported, citing Shanghai’s Municipal Health Commission.\nThe news comes as China — the country where the virus originated — now seeks to stave off a renewed outbreak caused by the virus entering the country from outside its borders.

The first offerings of the day needed adapting, for example, because Chinese tourists “don’t really fancy the European, Western breakfast,” he said he had learned. But since the COVID-19 outbreak, he said he had seen an 85 percent drop in business at his hotels in Mandalay and Bagan, an area covered with ancient temples, both places where Chinese tourists have flocked to in recent years.\nAnd at Yangon’s Bogyoke Market on a recent Saturday, tourists, particularly those from China, were largely missing. Saleswomen with no customers to entertain chatted among themselves and tapped on their phones behind glass cases displaying bracelets, pendants, and jade ornaments in shades varying from milky white to deep emerald. Sitting under one of the market’s covered walkways, Zin Min Tun, who has run half a dozen pearl and gem shops since 1996, estimated that the number of Chinese tourists over the previous month had dropped roughly 70 percent compared with last year. His fingers wrapped in thick ruby and agate rings, Zin Min Tun said Chinese tourists were the biggest buyers of jade, mined in Myanmar’s north, and the country’s pearls, which have a champagne-colored sheen. “The whole world depends on China,” he said. “Now they have money; they can spend around the world, not just Myanmar.”\nThe concerns Thant Zin Tun and other spoke of were reflected by analysts at Fitch Solutions, who last week said they were lowering their forecast for Myanmar’s GDP growth, noting that tourism would be “subdued over the coming months due to lower Chinese visitors from China’s ban on travel agent bookings, and also risk aversion from tourists of other nationalities due to Myanmar’s weak patient tracking capability.” (Upon my flight’s arrival into Yangon airport, workers in hazmat suits armed with thermometers entered the plane and took our temperatures.)\nWhile Thant Zin Tun bemoaned the lost business, May Myat Mon Win, the tourism federation vice chair, was quick to remind me that Myanmar was hardly the only country feeling the downturn and that others were even more reliant on Chinese visitors. “China is a giant, the dragon,” she told me. “If the dragon is hit harder than this, I think there is going to be more consequences for the global economy and, of course, tourism.”\nRead: The new coronavirus is a truly modern epidemic\nOne such area is Macau, the former Portuguese colony, which welcomed nearly 28 million visitors from mainland China last year, about 70 percent of all arrivals. (Macau is now a special administrative region that is part of China but, like Hong Kong, has a separate legal system, judiciary, and immigration regime.) Though Macau’s economy is almost wholly dependent on gaming, after a string of confirmed COVID-19 cases, the government forced all 41 casinos to halt operations for a 15-day period starting on February 5. Numerous hotels have temporarily shuttered as a result, and residents are largely abiding by the government’s recommendation to stay home. The gondolas used to ferry tourists through the artificial canals at the Venetian Hotel sat empty on the mouthwash-blue water, opera music echoing off the faux-Italian-building fronts. One security guard standing in front of a stopped escalator at the Parisian Hotel said that without any visitors, things had gotten “very boring.” A sales attendant in a luxury boutique busied himself by styling a mannequin, removing and replacing a pair of sunglasses and tweaking a bucket hat before settling on a final look, then starting again."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/opinion/letters/coronavirus-fear.html", "title": "Opinion | Fears About Coronavirus , in the U .

The World Health Organization characterizing it as a “very grave threat” globally serves only to trigger even more fear-mongering.\nHere’s the deal: The overwhelming majority of people who have died from the virus are Chinese residents of Hubei Province over age 60 who were already seriously ill and susceptible to viruses.\nI’m in China, about 500 miles from the epidemic’s epicenter. I’m taking precautions like washing my hands no less than 20 times a day and wearing a mask when I’m out in public, but I’m not overly concerned. Why? Because if you’re even marginally healthy and happen to contract the virus, you won’t die. You’ll be sick for a couple of weeks but will almost certainly recover.\nAnd if you’re not in China to begin with and haven’t been around anyone from Hubei Province recently, your chances of getting the virus are very small and dying from it infinitesimal. So anyone getting hysterical needs to chill out.\nDavid Friel\nShanghai\nTo the Editor:\nPeople certainly misjudge risk, and immediate threats such as influenza should not be ignored despite alarming reports of COVID-19. However, we should not fall for another human fallacy, the failure to appropriately assess and plan for future events.\nCOVID-19 might never establish itself in the United States beyond a handful of cases, but public health leaders and infectious diseases experts are worried about the prospect of a novel infection with ill-defined complication risks, one that raises the possibility of numerous deaths and a serious strain on our health system.\nThe need to aggressively prevent new pandemics is real, even if the threat to us is not immediate. Get your flu shot — that will help protect you from the flu. For pandemic prevention, we must support public health funding and international cooperation. The time is now, before it is too late.\nHenry M. WuAtlanta\nThe writer is an assistant professor at the Emory University School of Medicine and director of the Emory TravelWell Center. He is a former medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nTo the Editor:\nRe “Stop Wildlife Trade to Prevent Next Epidemic, Conservationists Say” (news article, Feb. 20):\nThis new coronavirus, like the 2003 SARS epidemic, originated in China’s live food markets, where animals, both wild and domestic, are crammed cheek to jowl with the human population — a disaster waiting to happen. We have very similar markets here in California, as does New York City, posing serious threats to all concerned.\nAnimals are routinely stacked four and five deep, without food or water, many butchered while fully conscious. California annually imports some two million non-native bullfrogs for human consumption. Most are commercially raised in China and Taiwan. God only knows what these frogs have been exposed to before shipment.\nHorrendously cruel and hazardous to human health, these markets should be permanently closed down worldwide, as they reportedly now are in China. Legislation is in order, both state and federal.\nEric Mills\nOakland, Calif.\nThe writer is coordinator of Action for Animals.\nTo the Editor:\nRe “For Asian-Americans, a Sneeze Brings Suspicion and Fear” (news article, Feb. 17):\nSadly, Asian-Americans are not facing increased scrutiny solely from uneducated and scared members of the public. Our own government is also in on the act. Flying home from a three-day business trip in Europe last week, I experienced “enhanced” screening at J.F.K. firsthand.\nAs my two Caucasian colleagues and I — all U.S. citizens with the same travel itinerary — went through passport control, I was pulled out and directed to a longer, slower line largely populated by persons of Asian descent. When I asked the T.S.A. agent why, he sheepishly claimed that the passport kiosk “misread” my form. I was subsequently stopped again and questioned by a second agent before I was allowed to leave the airport.\nI was shocked, angry and even more sympathetic to those who face profiling on a regular basis. But most of all, I was disappointed and ashamed — that my country would resort to the lowest common denominator in trying to prevent a global health crisis from reaching our shores.\nTammy Yuen\nBrooklyn"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/02/27/markets-wake-up-with-a-jolt-to-the-implications-of-covid-19", "title": "Spread and stutter - Markets wake up with a jolt to the implications of covid - 19 | Finance and economics", "text": "WHEN AMERICA, the hub of global capital, is this far into an economic expansion and a bull market, investors feel two conflicting impulses. They hope that the good times will last, so they are reluctant to pull their money out. They also worry that the party may suddenly end. This is the late-cycle mindset. It reacts to occasional growth scares—about trade wars or corporate debt or some other upset. But it tends not to take them seriously for long.\nCovid-19 is a grave threat to the market’s poise. News from Italy of the biggest coronavirus outbreak outside Asia led to a 3.4% decline in the S&P 500 index of American stocks on February 24th, the biggest one-day fall for two years. The rout encompassed global stockmarkets, which were down sharply from highs reached earlier in February. As The Economist went to press, the markets remained nervy. In the face of such uncertainty, more days like Monday are to be expected.\nInvestors have, sensibly, tried to calculate which assets are most exposed to the shock. Copper, an economic bellwether, plunged. The worst-hit stocks were of firms that rely on far-flung supply chains, such as carmakers; or are directly affected by restrictions on travel, such as airlines; or are most exposed to a China-led global slowdown, such as oil firms. Investors scrambled for safe assets. Gold reached a seven-year high. The dollar rallied. The yield on ten-year Treasury bonds fell to an all-time low of 1.29% on February 27th.\nBut there is also an uneasy sense that the virus could trigger a bigger rupture in financial markets that have been going up by so much for so long that pockets of dangerous risk-taking are bound to exist. Two worries are top of mind: the opaque edifice of financial instruments that rely on low volatility, and the swollen credit markets.\nStart with the first, volatility. Equity-market instability might feed on itself. The VIX, which measures the expected volatility implied by the price of options on the S&P 500 index, vaulted from around 15 to above 27 in a matter of days (see chart 1). Some investment strategies are particularly sensitive to it. For example when volatility is low, they allow for a bigger weighting of equities in portfolios. But when it rises and stays high, some investors are forced to unload some of their holdings—creating yet more volatility. Some exchange-traded funds whose value is linked to the VIX saw outflows. It is likely that at least some investors have been betting on continued near-dormant volatility. The resilience of such strategies could be tested.\nA bigger worry is credit markets and in particular corporate debt, which has soared over the past decade. A sharp rise in borrowing costs would hurt firms that need to roll-over maturing bonds and would also rattle America’s huge private-credit markets. The last big global growth scare, in late 2018, caused a panicky sell-off that briefly threatened to become a credit-crunch. So far the interest-rate spread over Treasuries demanded by investors to hold high-yield corporate paper has widened to 4.3 percentage points, with much of the impact felt by energy-sector bonds (see chart 2). That is cause for concern, not alarm. But new issuance has halted—by February 26th Wall Street had gone three days without any high-grade offerings, according to Bloomberg. If that continues there will be a corporate liquidity squeeze.\nInterest-rate cuts cannot do much to remedy the disruption. But they can help to soothe credit markets. Easier policy from the Federal Reserve has in the past—notably in 1998—been fuel for a late-cycle rally in risk assets in the face of formidable headwinds. A fortnight ago, just a single interest-rate cut from the Fed was priced in by the markets, says Kit Juckes of Société Générale, a French bank. Now two are. “We may be pricing in a third, if not a fourth, within a few weeks unless there’s a dramatic change in the covid-19 news.”■\nRead more:\nCovid-19 is now in 50 countries, and things will get worse (February 27th)\nTo curb covid-19, China is using its high-tech surveillance tools (February 27th)\nCovid-19 presents economic policymakers with a new sort of threat (February 20th)\nHow China’s coronavirus epidemic could hurt the world economy (February 13th)\nThis article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline \"Spread and stutter\""}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/doctors_urge_flu_shots_before_epidemic_peaks_16_mortality_rate_in_helsinki_region/11203467", "title": "Doctors urge flu shots before epidemic peaks , 16 % mortality rate in Helsinki region", "text": "Doctors urge flu shots before epidemic peaks\nInfluenza season is expected to peak in March in the Uusimaa region, which includes Helsinki.\nThis winter's influenza season will become more active over the next few weeks, predicts Eeva Ruotsalainen, deputy chief physician of the infectious diseases division of Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH, also known as HUS).\n\"So far 19 people have been in intensive care or monitoring in the HUCH region.

Worldwide, nearly 90,000 cases of coronavirus disease have since been confirmed, with more than 3,000 deaths attributed to the disease to date.\n-\nDownload the ERR News app for Android and iOS now and never miss an update!\nEditor: Aili Vahtla"}, {"url": "https://news.err.ee/1061031/foreign-ministry-adds-french-and-german-regions-to-travel-restrictions-list", "title": "Foreign ministry adds French and German regions to travel restrictions list", "text": "Foreign ministry adds French and German regions to travel restrictions list ({{contentCtrl.commentsTotal}})\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs has added the Alsace region in France and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany to its list of risk areas on Friday and is advising people not to travel there.\nThe ministry also suggests travelers reconsider the \"necessity\" of all trips abroad and said people should hold off on making future vacation plans.

All have come back negative for the disease.\nPossible cases were isolated from all other evacuees inside the centre while tests were undertaken, but have since rejoined other evacuees.\nOn Monday, three chartered flights were set to leave the remote island, returning all those from the first group home.\nContrary to the federal government’s earlier statements, Australians will not have to make their own way home from Perth – but will be flown to Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane and other capital cities. Earlier this month, the government also backtracked on plans that evacuees would have to pay $1,000.\nThe first flight from Christmas Island is scheduled to leave at 8am local time, with others following in two-hour increments, but all are subject to weather and delays.\nThe first flight will take passengers to Port Hedland, then to Sydney and Canberra, arriving in Sydney and Canberra in the evening. The second flight will go to Adelaide and Melbourne, touching down in Victoria just before midnight, local time. The third will fly to Perth and then Brisbane.\nAustralians who arrived in the second cohort to Christmas Island are also on track to leave on Wednesday morning.\nProf Yan Zhang, an academic at Western Sydney University who was on the first evacuation flight from Wuhan, said he was “very excited” to return home and see his wife and daughters.\n“I’m very grateful to all staff from Ausmat [Australian Medical Assistance Teams], the Australian army and other departments for their kindness, caring and unconditional support during our 14-day quarantine period.\n“I thank my wife and daughters – they talked to me every day to make sure I was OK here. I also thank my university colleagues and friends for their caring and support.”\nAustralian company AusDiagnostics, which is providing the testing equipment and kits for the medical teams inside the Christmas Island detention centre, said that the testing process has been “relatively straightforward”.\nAfter a phone call on the Friday before evacuees arrived, AusDiagnostics rapidly had equipment and testing kits shipped to Darwin, where it was flown to the island on a Hercules C-130 military aircraft.\n“As well, one of our staff members volunteered to travel with the equipment, and to go into quarantine, to help train the medical staff and assist with testing,” managing director Prof Keith Stanley said. “That was a great act of service to the community.”\nAusDiagnostics, based in Sydney but with offices around the world, developed a test for Covid-19 as soon as the virus was sequenced.\nThe advantage of having testing equipment and kits on the island means that the results of a test for a suspected case can be returned within “three or four hours”, Stanley told Guardian Australia, rather than samples having to be sent to a mainland hospital, where the turnaround might be two days. Faster results mean that isolation of suspected cases – within the quarantine facility – can be managed much more effectively.\nHe said the test for the Covid-19 is “relatively straightforward” and “much the same as a doctor would do for influenza in the winter”.\nA swab is taken from a patient’s nose or throat and then the nucleic acid from that sample is tested for the coronavirus, as well as other illnesses.\n“Our process looks for specific sequences which are characteristic of a particular virus. We developed a test for this specific coronavirus, but our process also tests for the standard winter coronavirus, Mers, the Middle East coronavirus, and Sars.”\nStanley said the two key assessments of any new viral outbreak were infectivity and mortality. Covid-19 appeared to be “quite infectious”, Stanley said, meaning early triaging and quarantining of suspected patients was vital, but that the mortality rate was still not clear, though it has been posited at being about 2%, “nothing like as bad as Sars and Mers”.\n“Yes we need to have precautions such as quarantining, but most people who have this infection would only experience symptoms something like a common cold.”"}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/woman_in_helsinki_tests_positive_for_novel_coronavirus/11229433", "title": "Woman in Helsinki tests positive for novel coronavirus", "text": "Woman in Helsinki tests positive for novel coronavirus\nThe Finnish female who tested positive for Covid-19 has a fever but is in good condition, hospital officials say.\nA Finnish woman has tested positive for novel coronavirus, officials at Helsinki University Hospital (HUS) said early Wednesday evening.\nThe patient, described as a woman of working age, was likely exposed to the virus during a trip to northern Italy's city of Milan, according to the hospital.\nEarlier on Wednesday Italy confirmed the 12th fatality of a coronavirus patient, and that the number of cases has risen to 378 up from 6 since last Friday, according to English language Italian news outlet The Local.\nHUS, THL offer more info\nHUS and the National Institute for Health and Welfare held a press conference on Wednesday evening.

It is also advisable to avoid direct contact with people who are sick.\nKeep your hands clean!\nFrequently washing your hands with soap and water can help prevent an infection. You can also use an alcohol-based sanitizing gel instead. If you have to cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow.

Among his friends “corona” is seen either as something that afflicts white people or a fiction. When life is a struggle it is hard to worry about a threat you cannot see.\nBesides, asks Mr Kgasago, what can Sowetans do about it? “Self-isolation is just not practical in the ’hood.” Most of the township is poor and crowded. Just 55% of households have piped water. “There is a mentality of if we die, we die, but we’re going to have a good time,” he says.\nThat may now be more difficult. On March 23rd Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president, announced a nationwide lockdown. The number of recorded cases in the country is the highest in Africa, at 709 as of March 25th. The rate of increase is similar to that of Italy at the same stage.\nOther countries in Africa could be just days behind. Most of its 54 states have confirmed infections. Some hope that hot and humid weather may slow the spread of the virus. But the evidence for that is inconclusive and any effect will be “modest”, reckons Marc Lipsitch of Harvard University. “We don’t know what it will do in Africa,” notes David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. But there is no reason to think it would be different from anywhere else, he says.\nIt could be worse. Most rich countries have struggled to respond to the outbreak. African ones have fewer medics and less kit. Social distancing is far harder in overcrowded slums. Lockdowns could increase poverty and hunger. Nor do most African countries have the money to tide people and companies over.\nAfrica has some advantages. It is a young continent facing a virus that mainly kills the old. There are an estimated 47m Africans over 65 and 6m over 80, out of a population of 1.3bn. In Europe the figures are 143m and 40m out of 750m people.\nAfrica has also had more time to prepare. Governments have closed borders and restricted air travel. Many have banned large gatherings. The vast majority of children are no longer at school. These steps have been taken sooner in the course of the disease than elsewhere. Uganda, for instance, closed schools before it had any confirmed infections. South Africa’s lockdown was announced before Britain’s, though Britain had more than 16 times as many known cases. Sierra Leone has declared a 12-month state of emergency despite not having a single confirmed case.\nAdvance warning has also allowed Africa to boost testing capacity. Today more than 40 countries can test for covid-19, up from just Senegal and South Africa in early February. Although they have many fewer testing kits than richer countries do, more are on the way. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba and perhaps China’s richest man, has donated 20,000 testing kits, 100,000 masks and 1,000 protective suits to each African country.\nExperience in dealing with other infectious diseases may prove useful. Roughly one in three deaths in Africa every year is from an infectious or parasitic disease, compared with one in 50 in Europe. Recent Ebola outbreaks, across west Africa in 2014-16 and in eastern Congo in 2018-20, have taught policymakers vital lessons.\nPeople who have dealt with Ebola, such as David Nabarro, a special envoy for covid-19 to the World Health Organisation, say it is essential to win over communities. One sign of success in Sierra Leone was when Ebola became known in the Mende language as “bonda wote”, literally “family turn round”—a sign that people were changing behaviour. “I am absolutely convinced that African countries can get on top of this quicker than European countries,” says Dr Nabarro.\nExperts also urge vigilance. “We are veterans of outbreaks,” says Monica Musenero, a Ugandan epidemiologist. The country has contained regular flare-ups of diseases such as Ebola and Marburg virus. Whereas Ebola always “announces itself”, covid-19 spreads quickly and quietly, she says. As doctors find cases of the new virus, they may be only “catching the tail”.\nThat is the worry across Africa, where outbreaks could rapidly overwhelm health systems. Sub-Saharan Africa has about one doctor for every 5,000 people, compared with one per 300 in Europe. Data are patchy, but the average American hospital may have more intensive-care beds than most African countries. Kenya has 130; Uganda 55; and Malawi about 25. In Zimbabwe there are probably even fewer in the public system, and doctors and nurses are on strike. Ventilators are scarce: Mali and Mozambique may have one per 1m people. Given the lack of capacity, the disease could be “horrific”, says Tom Frieden, a former head of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in America.\nThe underlying health of Africans may not help either. Doctors do not know if the more than 25m Africans infected with HIV are at greater risk from covid-19. Some speculate that anti-retroviral drugs may help fight the new virus, though early studies suggest otherwise. Even if this were the case, notes Denis Chopera, a Durban-based virologist, only about 60% of South Africans with HIV regularly take their pills.\nThe burden on health-care systems from covid-19 could impede treatment of other diseases. Studies of the Ebola outbreak in west Africa suggest that about as many people died because they could not get treatment for malaria, HIV and tuberculosis as from Ebola itself. Others died from being unable to give birth safely. Suppressing outbreaks of Lassa fever in Nigeria and measles in Congo could be hampered by the diversion of resources to covid-19.\nGovernments may also have a hard time convincing their citizens to take the new virus seriously. Fake news is one reason. Dodgy cures and conspiracy theories are spreading on WhatsApp groups, which typically have more members in Africa than elsewhere. In Congo the virus is seen as a “mzungu” (white person) disease. Some Ethiopians see their country as blessed and therefore protected. More than a quarter of Nigerians say they are immune, most commonly because they are “a child of God”.\nReligion may be doing more to spread the disease than stop it. Senegal was slow to stop pilgrims from travelling to the holy city of Touba, despite an outbreak. A Christian gathering in South Africa has been linked to another outbreak. Thousands still attend megachurches in Nigeria. Although many pastors and imams are spreading the gospel of handwashing, others are talking nonsense. Orthodox Christians in Ethiopia have promoted quack “cures” involving garlic, lemon and ginger. Prices of these foodstuffs have risen by more than 200%, and fights have broken out in markets over them.\nMany African leaders have been swift to ban religious meetings. Some churches are streaming services online. But this is not the case in Tanzania, where President John Magufuli has refused to close churches, saying: “That’s where there is true healing. Corona is the devil and it cannot survive in the body of Jesus.”\nAfrican governments face practical as well as spiritual obstacles. The state’s ability to enforce social distancing and lockdowns is questionable in cities, where two in every five Africans live. More than half of city-dwellers are in crowded slums (see map). In Alexandra, a slum in Johannesburg, there are more than 9,000 households per square km, compared with fewer than 700 in neighbouring Sandton, a posh suburb. In Kampala 71% of households sleep in a single room. Frequent handwashing with soap is difficult. In Makoko, a huge slum in Lagos, less than 20% of households have piped water. Conditions in refugee camps are often worse.\nPersuading slum-dwellers to stay in one-room shacks with many relatives will be tougher than getting people in New York or London to stay on the sofa watching Netflix. And few can work from home. Six in ten Ugandan workers are either self-employed or help out in a family business. If people do not work they do not eat, says Steven Agaba, who lives in a poor part of Kampala, Uganda’s capital. He gestures at a man selling fruit from a tarpaulin spread across the muddy ground. “It will not be the coronavirus to kill us, but the hunger.” It may also send the poor back to their villages, further spreading the disease.\nThe precariousness of everyday life means that the economic effects of covid-19 in African countries will be both colossal and different from the rich world. The welfare of a billion people depends on how governments balance saving lives from the virus while minimising economic damage in a continent where more than 400m people live on the equivalent of less than $1.90 a day. It is not at all clear how this Gordian knot can be untied.\nThe hit to economies was already apparent even before the first case of covid-19 was reported in Africa. More than 80% of its exports go to the rest of the world, the highest share of any big region save Australasia. About half of these are raw materials. As commodity prices have plunged, so have forecasts for growth and tax receipts.\nOther industries have been hammered too. Tourism, which employs more than 1m people in each of Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia and South Africa, has collapsed. In Kenya and Ethiopia, both exporters of flowers, bulbs are being fed to cows and roses are rotting in heaps. Manufacturing is stricken. Orders have dried up for clothes exporters in Ethiopia, Ghana and Lesotho.\nTrade is at a trickle. Dozens of scheduled ships are either not turning up at Mombasa port, in Kenya, or arriving partly empty. Remittances could soon dry up—a disaster for the 13 African countries where that money is worth more than 5% of GDP. (In Lesotho remittances equate to 23%.) The overall effect is “more serious than 2008”, says Albert Zeufack, the chief economist for Africa at the World Bank.\nIn some countries such as Malawi, where most people subsist by growing their own food, the economic impact of covid-19 may be relatively small. But in many others, the clampdowns on economic life are adding to the pain. Restrictions on movement and commerce will be especially harmful to workers in the informal economy—that is, most of the African labour force. Roughly 85% of workers do not receive a regular reported wage.\nOn March 21st Rwanda closed its border with Congo. The livelihoods of petty traders who buy food in one country and sell it in the other are in peril. In Goma, on the Congolese side, Naomi Sifa sits with a pile of bananas a few metres from the desolate frontier. By selling them in Rwanda she would normally make 3,000 francs ($1.77) each day, just enough to feed her family. No longer. “If they keep the border closed, they will kill people with hunger,” she says.\nThe economic consequences of covid-19 have not escaped African epidemiologists. For John Nkengasong, director of Africa CDC, a public-health body, the virus could be a “national-security crisis first, an economic crisis second, and a health crisis third”, if the responses are not calibrated appropriately. That does not mean letting the disease rip, but it does mean “community engagement” and careful monitoring of knock-on effects on poverty and the treatment of other diseases.\nAfrican authorities will probably struggle to shut down cities to the extent seen in Europe, never mind China. For the moment, though, they are trying to combine restrictions on movement with some steps to ease the economic pain. The Seychelles, for example, has pledged salary guarantees for private-sector employees for three months. South Africa has announced a tax holiday for businesses to encourage them to keep paying workers, and its central bank is extending credit lines to keep firms afloat. Senegal aims to spend about 6% of GDP feeding people and helping firms, but it must appeal for funds to do so.\nNo country is able to match the sums being spent in the West. Social safety nets, where they exist, tend to support old people and mothers, not the jobless. Cash transfers would be the quickest and most efficient response to avert mass poverty. So far, in response to the covid-19 crisis, 69 countries globally have introduced, adapted or expanded social-protection schemes. Yet in sub-Saharan Africa only South Africa and Kenya have done so.\nThe lack of action is in large part because African countries do not have enough money to do more. Between 2010 and 2018 average public debt in sub-Saharan Africa rose from 40% to 59% of GDP, the fastest increase of any developing region. More than half of African countries are above the IMF’s recommended limit for public debt. The World Bank says that 29 out of 47 African countries need to tax more than they spend just to keep their debt constant as a share of the economy. But their tax revenues are about to plummet and the cost of borrowing is soaring as investors flee to safety.\nA fiscal response on the scale seen in the rich world would require outside help. Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, has asked the G20 for an emergency package worth $150bn to boost health spending, shore up foreign reserves and patch up social safety nets. He wants the World Bank’s investment arm to tide over African companies hit by disruptions to global supply chains, for the IMF to increase its lending to poor countries and for existing debt to be rolled over or forgiven.\nThe West’s response may determine its relationships with African countries for decades. If the rich world declines to help more, China will probably dominate the response. Mr Ma’s gift may soon be followed by economic assistance, which could cement China’s position as the main partner for many African countries.\nOther political consequences of covid-19 will soon become clear. One may be a rise in xenophobia. Ethiopia and Cameroon, among others, have seen attacks on foreigners or their property. Autocrats such as Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni or Mr Magufuli may take advantage of a distracted world, and find covid-19 a convenient reason to delay elections or arrest dissidents.\nWhat will ultimately determine the fate of leaders on the continent, though, is how they combine their direct response to the virus with mitigating its vast indirect costs. Mr Ramaphosa has largely been open, decisive and bold. But even he will struggle to maintain public support as he tries to enforce a long lockdown. African countries face an unenviable task, which they cannot address alone. In trying to “flatten the curve” of the number of infected, they risk crushing their people. ■\nDig deeper:\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus hub\nThis article appeared in the Middle East & Africa section of the print edition under the headline \"Not immune\""}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/business/impact-of-coronavirus-knocks-markets-as-apple-iphone-supplies-are-hit-0psfjh9rr", "title": "Impact of coronavirus knocks markets as Apple iPhone supplies are hit", "text": "Impact of coronavirus knocks markets as Apple iPhone supplies are hit\nHeightened economic fears surrounding coronavirus knocked global markets today after Apple sounded the alarm over the widespread industrial paralysis triggered by the health crisis.\nShares in the technology group came under pressure, falling by more than 2.5 per cent at the opening in New York after it warned last night that iPhone supplies would be “temporarily constrained” while key Chinese factories reopen for business “more slowly than we had anticipated”.\nIts surprise statement over revenues weighed on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 200 points, or 0.7 per cent, at 29,196.

He said doctors are developing work groups and doing dry runs, so that if a surge hits, they won’t be “caught flat-footed.” They are rushing to repurpose the hospital and are changing inpatient wards into negative-pressure isolation wards to accommodate the needs of COVID-19 patients. He praised San Francisco Mayor London Breed and California Governor Gavin Newsom, who implemented stay-at-home policies “in the nick of time,” which bought them crucial weeks and helped flatten the curve.\nFahimi, though, is distressed by the unevenness of the national response. He cringes at the packed beaches in Florida. “It’s insulting to the health-care professionals who will have to deal with the consequences and irresponsibility of everyone who said this was business as usual,” he said.

His wife is a physician who worked in Milan, Italy, and has kept in touch with her Italian colleagues over the past three months. She had been warning him that the U.S. was not prepared for the virus. He said his hospital currently has less than a week’s worth of isolation gowns, “which we should have for every health-care professional treating a COVID-positive patient or person under investigation.” He also said they don’t have enough N95 masks.\nHe told me the crisis is forcing them to ask difficult questions, such as “Who is going to be treated when we don’t have enough space to treat everyone?” If an older patient breaks her hip, will he still be able to help her?

The only way to find the true number is by looking for immunity, which requires testing for proteins called antibodies in the blood that are evidence of past infection. Such antibody tests have been seen as key to reopening the country; other countries have even proposed using them for “immunity certificates” that would allow the immune to return to work.\nBut if the first results from antibody surveys, also known as “serosurveys,” in the U.S. are anything to judge by, simply not enough people are immune.

These rates do translate to many times more cases than officially documented, to be clear, but they are still a far cry from the 70 percent scientists believe is necessary to reach herd immunity and stop disease transmission.

From there, the passengers will be flown home at the cruise line’s expense.\nThe Westerdam was the latest cruise ship to be caught in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak. The virus-stricken ship Diamond Princess has been under quarantine at the Yokohama Bay in Japan since Feb. 5 and infections aboard continue to rise. At least 218 of the 3,700 passengers and crew are confirmed infected with COVID-19. That makes the ship by far the biggest cluster of the coronavirus outside mainland China.\nLast week, passengers on the World Dream cruise ship in Hong Kong were held for four days after the company learned that three passengers who had sailed on the vessel earlier were confirmed to have the virus.

The cruise was also offering free wi-fi and complimentary champagne.\n“We really can’t complain, we are after all on a luxury cruise ship,” she said.\nSally Walmsley, who was on the cruise with her husband and three kids, said on Wednesday that her family has had to cancel most of their travel plans because of the outbreak.

The cruise line was expected to launch a new cruise from Yokohama on Feb. 15, but it has canceled that trip.\nThe cruise line also announced that guests who traveled from or through mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau or had contact with a suspected case of COVID-19 at least 14 days prior to the scheduled departure would not be permitted on board any Holland America Line cruises.\n“For all of our cruises, we continue to monitor the evolving situation with respect to the coronavirus that originated in mainland China, and our medical experts are coordinating closely with global health authorities to implement enhanced screening, prevention and control measures for our ships globally,” the company announced on Feb. 6.\nAfter the ship was rejected from docking in Thailand, many passengers shared their experiences on social media, and some maintained a more optimistic outlook.

But other demographic variables – from high household incomes to large shares of foreign-born populations to areas with large numbers of overcrowded housing units – saw no significant link to COVID-19 case trends.\nThe numbers do help explain something that has seemed obvious to people living in the hard-hit Queens neighborhoods served by Elmhurst Hospital, where long lines of people waiting for testing and treatment have been one of the defining images of the pandemic.\nSome places have suffered disproportionately.\nVerónica Domínguez, a 48-year-old Mexican immigrant who lives with seven relatives in a three-room apartment in Corona, Queens, has been too scared to go out for the last two weeks.\n“I fear for the kids. I don’t want to keep working, get sick and pass the virus to them. The oldest has asthma,” she said in Spanish, referring to a 12-year-old granddaughter.\n“There are hard moments in which I don’t want to be cooped up anymore. But then I see the news, and I see how bad this area has been hit, and I repeat to myself that is better to stay home,” she said.\nAsked about why some areas had been hit harder than others, Dr. Mitchell Katz, chief executive of the city-run hospital system, said crowded housing could play a role.\n“We know that in Queens, many families, because of poverty, live together in very close quarters. So that while we are practicing as a city social distancing, you may have multiple families living together in a very small apartment. And so it’s easy to understand why there’s a lot of transmission of COVID occurring,” he said.\nYet some neighborhoods with significant numbers of poorer immigrants, like the bustling Chinese community in Flushing, Queens, have had as few positive tests per capita as any wealthy, whiter part of the city.\nAs of Thursday morning, the city had recorded 1,397 deaths from the virus. More than 48,000 city residents have tested positive for COVID-19. The true number of people sickened by the virus is likely much higher because officials have been rationing tests and encouraging all but the most seriously ill people not to seek treatment and instead ride it out at home.\nJackson Heights resident Guillermo Pintado is one of them.\nEven though the virus has him feverish and struggling for enough air to finish his sentences, he’s stayed out of the hospital and is riding it out in the studio apartment he shares with his three children.\nThe 64-year-old Ecuadorean construction worker said through a translator that his family is unable to bring in much money.\n“My son, he was called in to work two days last week, but since then they haven’t called him. I haven’t worked for much longer than that. Right now, we’re trying to make do with the savings that we have.”\nU.S. Rep. Grace Meng, who represents the part of Queens suffering the most, said many of her constituents do not have the luxury of staying home to self-quarantine.\n“A lot of my constituents are considered essential workers. A very high percentage of them are in the service industry, and so they aren’t able to just stay home,” she said. “Or they might be living with a relative who is an essential worker, a front-line worker that might not be able to self-quarantine either.”\nKatz said people getting sick in western Queens face a second problem, which is that their part of the city has half as many hospital beds per capita as Manhattan.\nJavier H. Valdés, co-executive director of the anti-poverty group Make the Road New York, added that in communities like Corona and Elmhurst “far too many residents lack access to adequate health care and live in overcrowded conditions. Safe, affordable housing is out of reach, and they are facing extreme vulnerability at this moment.”\nThe city’s public hospital system has been trying to ease the burden on Elmhurst Hospital by moving some patients out and moving additional staff in. It also increased its number of intensive care unit beds from 29 to 111 in 10 days.\nMost people who get the virus experience mild or moderate symptoms, including fever and cough. Others develop pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization. The risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems.\nThe AP’s analysis used the city’s zip code data as of 5 p.m. on April 1 and multiple variables from the American Community Survey regarding housing, age, race, immigration status and income.\n___\nThis story was first published on April 2, 2020.

Apply such maths to the world’s total of confirmed cases and deaths on March 11th and you get a fatality rate of 3.6%. But this figure, which epidemiologists call the “naive” case fatality rate, may be wrong in two different ways. First, many of the infections detected at this early stage of the epidemic are recent, so some will eventually result in deaths. That will push the fatality rate up. Second, many infections have not been spotted because testing for the virus has been patchy. Lots of mild cases of the disease have gone unnoticed. If all infections were actually counted, the result would be a bigger denominator. That would push the fatality rate down. As China began to trace infections more carefully, its fatality rate fell (see chart 1).\nA conclusive measure of the denominator requires testing for antibodies against the virus in a large sample of people in a place which an outbreak has already swept through. Such studies are under way in China. In the meantime, researchers have estimated the fatality rate for covid-19 using a cohort of people for whom there is a full count of infections and deaths: passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. A bungled quarantine on board led to nearly 700 cases of covid-19. Eight people have died so far. A working paper published on March 5th by Timothy Russell at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and an international team of researchers estimates that the fatality rate among infected passengers will end up being 1.2%.\nThe researchers applied the results from the ship to data on covid-19 cases and deaths in China. They conclude that the fatality rate for covid-19 in the country’s outbreak was 0.5%. For comparison, that is five times the fatality rate for the seasonal flu in America.\nThe covid-19 fatality rate among those on the Diamond Princess was higher partly because their average age was 58, older than the general population in any country. At the same time, they are probably in fairly good shape. They must be healthy enough to embark on an extended holiday. People who go on cruises tend to be richer. So the fatality rate among these passengers may be lower than it would be among people of a similar age in their home countries.\nA recent study by researchers at the University of Bern, in Switzerland, sheds more light. It provides estimates of covid-19 fatality by age group in Hubei, the province in China with the worst outbreak of the disease (see chart 2). Fatality is dramatically higher among people older than 60, rising to 18% among those in their 80s or older.\nBut covid-19 may prove no less devastating for poor countries, which tend to have younger populations. The disease is more severe in people whose immune systems are weakened by chronic diseases, so those who are malnourished or have HIV/AIDS will probably be hit hard.\nThe fatality rate in any country will depend primarily on the quality of care it can provide—and how many people have access to it. About 5% of people diagnosed with covid-19 in China have needed intensive care, which is in short supply or non-existent in most hospitals in developing countries. A surge in cases even in rich countries can soon overwhelm hospitals and result in higher fatality rates. ■\nDig deeper:\n- For more coverage of covid-19 see our coronavirus hub\n- The science of the virus\n- How to deal with a new sort of financial shock\n- Should other countries copy Italy’s nationwide lockdown?\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus hub\nThis article appeared in the International section of the print edition under the headline \"Where will it be worst?\""}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-americans-are-sick-lost-february/608521/", "title": "How Many Americans Are Sick ?

The rising number of diagnoses in patients who had never visited China could be the “tip of the iceberg”, he added.\nTedros said the virus had been named COVID-19, explaining that it was important to avoid stigma and that other names could be inaccurate.\nUnder a set of guidelines issued in 2015, WHO advises against using place names such as Ebola and Zika – where those diseases were first identified, and which are now inevitably linked to them in the public mind.\nPeople’s names – usually referring to the scientists who identified the disease – are also banned, as are “terms that incite undue fear” such as “unknown” or “fatal”, the WHO said.\nThe world must “wake up and consider this enemy virus as public enemy number one,” said Tedros.\nEarlier Hong Kong’s leading public health epidemiologist, one of the experts called to Geneva for the meeting, told the Guardian that the coronavirus epidemic could spread to about two-thirds of the world’s population if it could not be controlled.\nProf Gabriel Leung, the chair of public health medicine at Hong Kong University, said the overriding question was to figure out the size and shape of the iceberg. Most experts thought that each infected person would transmit the virus to about 2.5 other people. That gave an “attack rate” of 60-80%.\n“60% of the world’s population is an awfully big number,” Leung told the Guardian in London, en route to Geneva on Tuesday.\nThe virus has killed more than 1,000 people, infected more than 42,000 and reached at least 25 countries, with the WHO declaring a global health emergency.\nEven if the general fatality rate was as low as 1%, which Leung thinks is possible once milder cases are taken into account, the death toll would be massive.\nLeung planned to tell the WHO meeting that the main issue was the scale of the growing worldwide epidemic, and the second priority was to find out whether the drastic measures taken by China to prevent the spread had worked – because if so, other countries should think about adopting them.\nThe meeting brings together more than 400 researchers and national authorities, including some participating by video conference from mainland China and Taiwan. To date, China has reported 42,708 confirmed cases, including 1,017 deaths.\nEpidemiologists and modellers were trying to figure out what was likely to happen, said Leung. “Is 60-80% of the world’s population going to get infected? Maybe not. Maybe this will come in waves. Maybe the virus is going to attenuate its lethality because it certainly doesn’t help it if it kills everybody in its path, because it will get killed as well,” he said.\nExperts also need to know whether restrictions in the centre of Wuhan and other cities have reduced infections. “Have these massive public health interventions, social distancing and mobility restrictions worked in China?” he asked. “If so, how can we roll them out, or is it not possible?”\nThere would be difficulties. “Let’s assume that they have worked. But how long can you close schools for? How long can you lock down an entire city for? How long can you keep people away from shopping malls? And if you remove those [restrictions], then is it all going to come right back and rage again? So those are very real questions,” he said.\nIf China’s lockdown has not worked, there is another unpalatable truth to face: that the coronavirus might not be possible to contain. Then the world will have to switch tracks: instead of trying to contain the virus, it will have to work to mitigate its effects.\nFor now, containment measures are essential. Leung said the period of time during which people were infected but showed no symptoms remained a huge problem. Quarantine was necessary, but to ensure people were not still carrying the virus when they left, everybody should ideally be tested every couple of days. If anyone within a quarantine camp or on a stricken cruise ship tested positive, the clock should be reset to 14 days more for all the others.\nSome countries at risk because of the movement of people to and from China have taken precautions. On a visit to Thailand three weeks ago, Leung talked to the health minister and advised the setting up of quarantine camps, which the government has done. But other countries with links to China appear, inexplicably, to have no cases – such as Indonesia. “Where are they?” he asked.\nTedros asked countries to be “as aggressive as possible” in fighting the coronavirus.\n“If the world doesn’t want to wake up and consider the virus as public enemy number one, I don’t think we will learn from our lessons,” he said. “We are still in containment strategy and should not allow the virus to have a space to have local transmission.\n“We are not defenceless,” Tedros added. “If we invest now … we have a realistic chance of stopping this outbreak.”\nNo specific treatment or vaccine against the virus exists. The WHO has repeatedly urged countries to share data in order to further research into the disease. “That is especially true in relation to sharing of samples and sequences. To defeat this outbreak, we need open and equitable sharing, according to the principles of fairness and equity,” Tedros told the scientific conference.\nHe said he hoped the scientists could agree a roadmap “around which researchers and donors will align”.\nSeveral teams of experts in Australia, Britain, China, France, Germany and the US are racing to develop a vaccine – a process that normally takes years.\nEfforts to come up with a vaccine are being led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a body established in 2017 to finance costly biotechnology research in the wake of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people.\nUltimately, however, scientists may end up in the same situation they were in during the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) – which died out before a vaccine could be fully developed."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2020/feb/16/coronavirus-outbreak-hove-community", "title": "Coronavirus in Hove :  Im trying to be less scared … worry wont keep us safe  | Global", "text": "Coronavirus in Hove: ‘I’m trying to be less scared … worry won’t keep us safe’\nThis month marked the first time I’ve ever been to a queue-free post office, and been served by a man wearing gloves in the service station. “We’ve been told to use antibacterial gel every half hour too,” he told me. Supermarkets are quieter than usual, but with no signs of panic buying – unless hand sanitiser counts. “I went to five shops and couldn’t find any,” a neighbour texted me. Dozens of people are “self-isolating”, and it’s a risky place for secret affairs because of the chance everyone you’ve been in touch with will need tracing.\nThis is life at the centre of the UK coronavirus breakout, Hove. I’d like to pretend that I’ve been brave, but it wouldn’t be true. I found the outbreak four streets away of a virus that had at that point killed hundreds of people in China alarming. The anxiety I felt came in waves, sending my maternal protectiveness into overdrive.\nMy response to Covid-19 was an almost overwhelming desire to scoop up my two-year-old daughter Astrid and nine-month-old son Xavier and keep them safe. My fears were exacerbated because my son has a heart condition which makes him vulnerable. And I’m a solo mum, so there’s no spare adult on hand in an emergency. Our family moved to Hove a year ago, lured by the sea and the wonderful community where children are in and out of each other’s houses all the time. I wanted Astrid and Xavi to feel safe playing out as they grew up. I didn’t expect to face this. But it’s the strength of our community that has saved me in my worst moments of panic.\nI’m lucky that I bumped into Emma, a nurse living on my street, who reminded me, kindly, that I was calm about common flu, despite it being more prevalent. That another neighbour, Lisa, reassured me she was sure it was under control. That my phone buzzed with people checking in, and my mum offering help. That my brother and sister-in-law repeatedly explained that I was miscalculating risk. That my friend Lucinda sent sweets in case we were told to self-isolate. That my MP Peter Kyle has been brilliant, measured and present, chatting to residents rather than letting fears grow in the silence: acknowledging constituents’ worries and calming panic.\nAt the nursery where my children go twice a week and take trips to the beach, park and forest, staff created “corona policy”. They took time to reassure me how swiftly they’d tell parents if someone was asked to self-isolate, and contacted Public Health England to ask about extra measures to protect Xavi.\nConcerned parents of older children have been keeping them at home, with a total of nine schools across the region authorising absences because of having a pupil or teacher in isolation. A neighbour told me that at one local school, which has been surrounded by media since Tuesday, nine out of 30 children were in reception class on Thursday, while classes for older children were about half full.\nThe parents I spoke to felt the schools were doing a good job of educating pupils about the virus, teaching children to cough and sneeze into their arms rather than hands and high-five with elbows to avoid spreading germs. One asked children to bring in hand sanitiser and tissues, while another’s assembly included the CBeebies doctors’ explanation of why coronavirus may not be as scary as it sounds. Depressingly, yet another school had to write to parents and pupils warning that racism towards the Chinese community in its classrooms would not be tolerated.\nAs last week wore on, my panic eased. I don’t know whether it was the lull in new confirmed cases locally, or my body being too tired to sustain the heightened anxiety. Pragmatism took over: we were short on nappies and bread. I was relaxed enough to take my children to the park and shops, but I delayed a non-urgent hospital appointment for my son, to be extra safe.\nMy neighbour told me her daughter and a group of pals had organised a collection for their classmate, the daughter of recovered coronavirus victim Steve Walsh. The whole family have tested negative, but last week she was still in isolation. They’ve bought her a Brighton and Hove Albion T-shirt with her name embroidered on it, ready for when she returns to school.\nSo now I’m following the example of a group of primary-school children whose empathy and bravery I admire, and trying to be less scared. Because worry isn’t helping to keep any of us safe."}, {"url": "https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-israel-france-pandemic-cfa6793a-7c15-4618-99da-077b9ecf2575.html", "title": "Israel and France to close restaurants and cafes", "text": "Israel and France to close restaurants and cafes\nA restaurant in Le Touquet, France on March 14.

But it has gained an audience with the help of well-connected critics of the Chinese government such as Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist. And on Sunday, it got its biggest public boost yet.\nSpeaking on Fox News, Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, raised the possibility that the virus had originated in a high-security biochemical lab in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak.\n“We don’t have evidence that this disease originated there,” the senator said, “but because of China’s duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says, and China right now is not giving evidence on that question at all.”\nMr. Cotton later walked back the idea that the coronavirus was a Chinese bioweapon run amok. But it is the sort of tale that resonates with an expanding chorus of voices in Washington who see China as a growing Soviet-level threat to the United States, echoing the anti-Communist thinking of the Cold War era.\nRight-wing media outlets fan the anger. Beijing, with its heavy-handed censorship and stranglehold on information, unwittingly gives the conspiracy theories a boost.\nThe idea of the coronavirus as an escaped weapon has been carried through international news outlets like the British tabloid The Daily Mail and The Washington Times, which suggested that the virus was being developed as part of China’s biowarfare program.\nLast month, Mr. Bannon invited Bill Gertz, a Washington Times reporter, to be a guest on the inaugural episode of his radio show “War Room: Pandemic,” a spinoff of his “War Room: Impeachment,” which defended Mr. Trump during the Senate impeachment trial.\nLatest Updates: Economy\n- Latest projection: A deep recession and ballooning unemployment in Europe.\n- A stock rally fades as global markets waver.\n- Airlines are burning through $10 billion a month, an industry executive says.\n“Bill Gertz had an amazing piece in The Washington Times about the biological labs that happen to be in Wuhan,” Mr. Bannon said on his Jan. 25 show. Mr. Gertz appeared on another show several days later to continue putting forward the bioweapons theory.\nFox News has also dabbled in the theory, in one article drawing a connection between a 1980s thriller by Dean Koontz that “predicted coronavirus.” The book is about a Chinese military lab that creates a biological weapon.\nThe Chinese authorities say the outbreak began in a market in Wuhan where wild animals were sold. The city is also home to a biochemical laboratory.\nAlthough much remains unknown about the coronavirus, experts generally dismiss the idea that it was created by human hands. Scientists who have studied the coronavirus say it resembles SARS and other viruses that come from bats. While contagious, so far it appears to largely threaten the lives of older people with chronic health issues, making it a less-than-effective bioweapon.\nA plethora of misinformation has led World Health Organization workers to call it an “infodemic.”\nSpreading that information are some well-known critics of the Chinese government like Mr. Bannon and Guo Wengui, a Chinese fugitive billionaire. The two have pledged to raise a $100 million fund to investigate corruption, help people they believe to be victims of Chinese government persecution and, in Mr. Guo’s words, take down China’s Communist Party.\nHours after Mr. Cotton made his comments on Fox News, Mr. Guo took to his own media platform, G News, to boast in a 30-minute video that he had predicted that China would manufacture a crisis like the virus outbreak.\n“I said a year ago that Chinese Communist Party might create a massive humanitarian crisis or a natural disaster or a pandemic before it dies,” Mr. Guo said from his $68 million apartment on the edge of Central Park in New York.\n“On a wall at the entrance to Wuhan P4 lab, there is a slogan: When you step into this building, you enter into Pandora’s box,” Mr. Guo added, referring to the high-security lab.\nHe claimed that the lab has military connections, including that soldiers from the People’s Liberation Army serve as guards. He did not offer proof.\nMr. Guo is no stranger to conspiracy theories. The website for G News — which carries the slogan “Truth, Freedom” — is populated with headlines like “Breaking news: China will admit coronavirus coming from its P4 lab” and “Dead: founder of Canada’s P4 Lab, key to Wuhan coronavirus investigation.”\nHe has also advanced other claims without evidence. In 2018, he claimed that HNA, a Chinese conglomerate, had played a role in the death of its co-chairman, Wang Jian, in an accident in France. The French authorities ruled Mr. Wang’s death an accident. The company declined to comment at the time on Mr. Guo’s claims.\nMr. Guo waged his war against the Chinese government from Facebook and Twitter for months, but then both social media platforms suspended his accounts after he posted the personal information of Chinese people online.\nMr. Guo has had more success as views about China in Washington have grown more sinister. Mr. Cotton on Sunday helped make them part of the American political establishment.\nSpeaking to the Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo, Mr. Cotton suggested that a dearth of information about the coronavirus’s origins was raising more questions than answers.\n“We don’t know where it originated, and we have to get to the bottom of that,” he said on the program “Sunday Morning Futures.”\nAfter receiving criticism for lending credence to what has been largely considered a fringe theory, the senator took to Twitter to say that he did not necessarily think the virus was an “engineered bioweapon.”\nThat idea, he said, was just one of several hypotheses that included the possibility that the outbreak was a “deliberate release.”\nHe also said it was possible that the virus had spread naturally, “but almost certainly not from the Wuhan food market.”\nCao Li contributed research."}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/hus_trials_underground_reserve_hospital/11334649", "title": "HUS trials underground reserve hospital", "text": "HUS trials underground reserve hospital\nHUS said it is merely preparing for the possibility of a sudden spike in coronavirus infections.\nOn Monday the Helsinki and Uusimaa hospital district allowed journalists a sneak peek at a prototype of reserve hospital facilities that could be taken into use if there is a surge in coronavirus cases requiring hospital care.\nThe backup facility, which HUS first mentioned in early April, will likely be located in an underground parking lot at Helsinki's Meilahti hospital.\nAccording to data from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare THL, so far there have been 3,700 diagnosed cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus in the HUS region.\nHospital district officials have described the current situation as calm and said that patients who need hospital care have been able to get it.

Instead it turned out to be a complete car crash\nEurope is being ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. There have been more than 10,000 deaths in Italy. In the grimmest of league tables, Spain comes second. Normal life has been suspended across the continent and the hit to the economy is immense. France’s output is running at two-thirds of what it was last year. Germany has abandoned fiscal rectitude and – along with the rest – adopted a “whatever it takes” approach.\nBorder controls have been erected to stop the flow of people even though this contravenes one of the founding principles of the single market. Rules on state aid to struggling companies have been relaxed. The European Central Bank has embarked on a gigantic asset purchase scheme in an attempt to flood the eurozone economy with cheap money.\nJean Monnet, the driving force behind the creation of what was to become the European Union in the 1950s, said that Europe would be forged in crises, and Covid-19 clearly meets that criterion. The twin health-economic emergency is by far the worst crisis Europe has had to face since the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957: worse than the oil shock of the mid-1970s, worse than the banking meltdown of 2008.\nThat, though, was not the end of Monnet’s observation. He went on to say that the sort of Europe that would be forged would depend on the “solutions adopted for those crises”. And, in that respect, the signs have not been good.\nIf ever there was a time for the EU to act as one, for the richer countries to show solidarity with those less fortunate, then this is it. Yet when Italy pleaded for fellow countries to send it medical equipment such as masks, France and Germany not only failed to respond, they placed export bans (since lifted) on the export of the kit Italian hospitals were crying out for. In the end it was left to China to show EU how to respond to a country in dire need.\nAnother problem for Italy is that because of its slow growth and high levels of public debt it has to pay a higher rate of interest on the money the government borrows than is the case for Germany and, when the hospitals in the cities of Lombardy started to fill up with Covid-19 cases, this gap – or spread – started to widen. It was therefore deeply unhelpful for Christine Lagarde, the president of the ECB, to say that it was not the job of her institution to “close bond spreads”.\nLagarde, to her credit, quickly recanted and the ECB is now doing its utmost to help Italy and the wider eurozone economy. But the crisis has highlighted the weaknesses of the eurozone: the lack of coordination between monetary policy run by the ECB from Frankfurt and fiscal policy under the control of member states; the lack of a sizeable, single budget; the absence of financial tools that would make a collective approach easier.\nLast week’s virtual meeting of EU leaders was supposed to come up with a joint approach to the crisis but was instead a complete car crash. One group of countries – including Italy, Spain and France – wanted the creation of corona bonds, which would be issued collectively by all eurozone countries.\nThe thinking behind a corona bond is simple. By pooling risk, hard-pressed countries such as Italy and Spain would benefit from the reputation for financial probity of countries like Germany and the Netherlands. Of the money raised, the lion’s share would go to the countries at greatest need and at lower rates of interest than they would have to pay if they were issuing their own national bonds.\nYet even in these quite exceptional circumstances, corona bonds proved to be a non-starter. Germany thought Italy should ask for assistance through the European Stability Mechanism, where the money comes with strings attached. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said under no circumstances would he agree to common bonds. For Germany, the Netherlands and a number of other northern European eurozone members, it is a question of moral hazard: the countries that are running big budget deficits will never change their ways if they think they can always borrow on the cheap.\nThe Italians and the Spanish also dug their heels in, preferring for the meeting to end with no agreement rather than accept the stigma of conditionality. So, in time-honoured fashion, the can was kicked down the road, with eurozone finance ministers given a couple of weeks to come up with something.\nOne possible solution would be to get round the moral hazard problem by making the corona bonds a one-off solution to a quite exceptional crisis. If, as is possible, the emergency is relatively short-lived, the Germans and the Dutch ought to be able to support the idea of corona bonds are for 2020 only.\nThere is little doubt which side Monnet would be backing. This is not just about providing a lifeline to Italy, important though that is. Nor is it simply about avoiding the meltdown of already shaky Italian banks, which would have ripple effects across the eurozone. It is about political legitimacy and whether the EU goes forward or backwards.\nItaly’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said at the weekend: “If Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d’être to the people. We are at a critical point in European history.”\nThat just about sums things up. The message being sent out is that Europe is a project for the good times and that when the going gets tough people can only really rely on their own government and the nation state."}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/27/coronavirus-can-you-catch-covid-19-twice-euronews-answers", "title": "Coronavirus : Can you catch COVID - 19 twice ? ", "text": "Scientists are working to discover all they can about the behaviours of the COVID-19 coronavirus, from how it manifests itself in the body to how it spreads between people.\nThe scale of scientific research into the virus is \"unprecedented,\" immunologist Prof Luke O'Neill told Euronews. \"We have a huge amount of knowledge about various aspects,\" he said.\nA key question that has dominated discussion is whether a person can be infected more than once by the virus. So, what do we know?\n\"We don't fully know\"\n\"That's the really important question and the answer is that we don't fully know, is the truth,\" Prof O'Neill said.\n\"But there is good evidence that we are probably protected if you were infected,\" he added.\nProf O'Neill pointed to experiments that have been done with monkeys who were infected with the virus and when the tried to reinfect them, they couldn't.\n\"Secondly, we know that we make a big antibody response to this virus. Loads of antibodies are churning in your system. They are the virus busters,\" he said.\n\"If you carry these antibodies, that means you've had the virus and that means you're no longer infectious,\" he added.\nHow long does immunity last?\nAlthough there is \"good evidence\" to suggest that you can become immune to the virus, how long this lasts has yet to be determined.\n\"People who work in other coronaviruses say about a year, maybe, which is good,\" Prof O'Neill said. \"If you do get a second infection it is much milder, but we don't fully know as it's a new virus,\" he said, adding that there is \"optimism that if you are infected once you should be protected\".\nEuropean exit strategies, including in France, have acknowledged the low rate of immunity among their population, estimating it to stand between 1% and 6%, with countries such as Ireland warning that lifting restrictions too soon could lead to a significant rebound in cases.\nThe question as to whether a person could be infected more than once gained traction back in March, where a local government in Japan said it had recorded the first case of a person who has tested positive after apparently recovering from an earlier bout.\nAccording to NHK, the woman, in her 40s, is a tour bus guide who travelled with tourists from Wuhan, China, in January. She tested positive for COVID-19 on January 29 and was given the all-clear by February 6.\nJust weeks later, the woman began exhibiting symptoms and was tested again - only for it to return as another positive result.\nWe spoke with experts in March, who at the time stressed that nothing is really impossible while research is ongoing to find out everything there is to know about the virus.\nBut in terms of getting infected twice, they generally said other scenarios are more probable.\nConnor Bamford, a virologist at the Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine at Queen's University in Belfast, told Euronews it is \"unlikely\" the woman was re-infected but underlined there was still a lot to learn.\nHe said: \"This is potentially an important development but there’s still a lot we don’t know.\n\"Also, this is likely to be a rare event so it might not make much of an impact during the outbreak.\"\nMeanwhile, Fabienne Krauer, an epidemiologist in Oslo, Norway, said: \"We cannot know if this is a re-infection unless we explicitly know that the woman cleared the virus in between.\"\nShe went on to say that if it were the case as stated in Japanese reports that two tests in a month had returned positive, then \"we can't tell if this is a real re-infection or a persistent infection.\"\nIs it a persistent infection?\nShort answer: it could be.\nPhilip Tierno, a professor of microbiology and pathology at NYU School of Medicine, told Euronews one possibility could be that the woman was \"originally colonised\" by the SARS-like illness - meaning it lingered in her body without her being \"truly infected\".\nHe said she may then have experienced \"a very mild upper respiratory course, which did not evoke her immune system\" and later tested negative if the test did not pick up the virus somewhere in her body.\n\"Later, she developed a significantly lower respiratory infection,\" he added.\nREAD MORE:\nHow can you prevent yourself from getting coronavirus?\nHow effective are masks, closed borders, screenings and quarantines?\n'My kids exhaust me more than COVID-19,' says doctor in quarantine with his family\nPut more simply, according to Bart Haagmans, a virologist at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, a mild initial infection could result in a limited response from the immune system.\nThis could allow the coronavirus to \"replicate upon a second exposure,\" he said.\nAny other possibilities?\nBoth Tierno and Bamford noted that it could just simply be a mistake made with the testing procedure.\n\"Tests are not perfect,\" Tierno said.\nBut, according to Bamford, these concerns about re-infection are not yet a priority.\nHe said: \"We should keep an eye on this but I don’t think it is anything to worry about now.\n\"The vast, vast majority of cases are from first infections and these are the ones we should worry about.\""}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-covid-19-infection-equal-immunity-11587314824", "title": "Does Covid - 19 Infection Equal Immunity ?

Nearby is the stainless steel Unisphere from the 1964 World’s Fair, and three miles west is Flushing’s Main Street, with its crowded dim sum parlors. Corona, though, feels like a suburb wedged into the city, and it’s here, on a quiet residential block, with modest century-old detached homes with small cement porches and aluminum siding, that you’ll find one of the country’s great unheralded design museums: the jazz trumpeter and bandleader Louis Armstrong’s miraculously preserved house, where he lived from 1943 until his death in 1971, at age 69.\nArmstrong was born in New Orleans in 1901, dropped out of school as a child and was a successful touring musician in his early 20s. By 1929, he was living in Harlem, though as one of the most popular recording artists in the country, he traveled about 300 nights a year. In 1939, he met his fourth and final wife, Lucille Wilson, a dancer at Harlem’s Cotton Club. Lucille, who spent part of her childhood in Corona, decided it was time for her husband to settle down in a house, a real house, instead of living out of hotel rooms. (Even their wedding took place on the road, in St. Louis, at the home of the singer Velma Middleton.) One day, when Armstrong was away at a gig, she put a down payment of $8,000 (around $119,000 in today’s money) on 34-56 107th Street. She didn’t tell him she’d done this until eight months later, during which time she made the mortgage payments herself. (Lucille didn’t like being told no; as Hyland Harris, who manages the Louis Armstrong House Museum gift shop, located in what was once the garage — the biggest aberration between the house today and its past incarnations — told me, “There is a reason why she was the last wife.”)\nFrom the outside, the two-bedroom, 3,000-square-foot house looks just like any other on the block, which was deliberate. Armstrong often referred to himself as “a salary man” and felt at ease alongside the telephone operators, schoolteachers and janitors of Corona, a neighborhood that, in a testament to how much of his life was spent in jazz clubs, he referred to affectionately as “that good ol’ country life.” One of the earliest integrated areas of New York, Corona was mostly home to middle-class African-Americans and Italian immigrants when the Armstrongs moved in. The demographics would change in the coming decades — Latin Americans began replacing the Italians in the ’60s, and now make up most of the neighborhood — but not much else. There was never a mass wave of gentrification or development here, and Armstrong himself was so concerned with blending in with his working-class neighbors that when his wife decided to give the house a brick facade, Armstrong went door-to-door down the block asking the other residents if they wanted him to pay for their houses to receive the same upgrade. (A few of his neighbors took him upon the offer, which accounts for the scattered presence of brick homes on the street to this day.)\nOne wouldn’t know from the sidewalk that the interior of the house is a more or less perfect reflection of the Armstrongs’ life circa 1969, when Lucille made her final round of renovations during her husband’s lifetime with the help of her interior decorator, Morris Grossberg. Armstrong’s half-empty bottle of Lanvin cologne still sits on the dresser in the master bedroom; their old Electrolux vacuum cleaner is still stashed in a hallway closet. No two rooms are alike — “I guess ‘Rococo’ is the word I could use without losing my job,” Harris said of the overall aesthetic — though many are surprisingly modest, especially given Armstrong’s larger-than-life presence. He is the only person ever to have hit records in the ’20s, ’30s, ’40s, ’50s and ’60s. He played behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War and in the Democratic Republic of Congo during decolonization in 1960, during which both sides of a civil war called a truce to watch him perform, then picked up fighting again once his plane took off. There are few American figures as legendary and beloved, and yet, as Harris told me, a common reaction people have upon entering his home is, “This reminds me of my grandmother’s house.” Certainly the living room recalls a ’60s vision of Modernism with a vaguely minimalist formality. The gold sconces offer a glimmer of opulence, but the walls themselves are covered in a subdued, cream-colored wallpaper — the same wallpaper that covered them at least 50 years ago. It matches the upright piano standing against one wall, and the two twill couches. There’s also a small TV — one of the first on the block — that sits low to the floor, so that the neighborhood children whom Armstrong would invite over (he never had kids of his own) could sit comfortably on the floor to watch Westerns.\nLUCILLE CONSIDERED THIS a starter home and spent several years trying to convince Armstrong to purchase a more lavish property. She would occasionally put down payments on properties in Harlem or on Long Island only for Armstrong to issue stop payments. He liked it in Corona, and after establishing roots for the first time in his life, he wanted to stay. So Lucille instead channeled her energy into frequent renovations: For the first three years they lived there, Lucille’s mother occupied the second floor; after she died, in 1946, the couple took over the whole house.\nThe most ostentatious room by far is the first-floor bathroom, which is covered in wall-to-wall gold-rimmed mirrors — as Armstrong once wrote, “It’s a pleasure to see yourself wipe your ass from all angles” — with marble floors, a marble bathtub and a marble sink converted from a birdbath. It feels more like something that belongs in a penthouse suite of a ’70s-era Las Vegas hotel; the care lavished upon the space is perhaps expected from a man who emphatically loved using the bathroom. (Armstrong even had a favorite brand of laxatives, Swiss Kriss, an herbal product that he’d mail sample packets of to fans who wrote to him, along with a picture of him sitting on the toilet, holding the laxatives and beaming his famous, enormous grin; his slogan, “Leave It All Behind Ya,” was printed beneath the image.)\nNo less startling is the kitchen, a room that exemplifies ’60s Futurism and was partially inspired by the space age exhibitions at the 1964 World’s Fair: There are clear acrylic shelving units, a blender installed into a countertop, a can opener built into a wall and a bespoke Crown stove with six burners, two broilers, two ovens and a small gold placard that reads “Custom Made by Crown for Mr. and Mrs. Louis Armstrong.” The cabinets are lacquered a deep blue — a shade that, in a certain light, looks like the color of the Earth as seen from space, a hue similar to Lucille’s beloved Cadillac.\nUpstairs — past the master bedroom, where Lucille’s tiny gold slippers still rest on the floor next to the king-size bed, and where the silver wallpaper is so shiny you can actually see your reflection in it — is the most moving room in the house: Armstrong’s personal den. To this day, it houses his liquor cabinet (still stocked as it was at the time of his death, including a half-drunk bottle of Jack Daniel’s), his desk and typewriter, his record collection, which included works by more avant-garde jazz masters (Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk) and his reel-to-reel tape machine, a gadget by which he documented his remarkable talent for the spoken word. Armstrong left behind some 700 tapes, from recordings of his favorite interviews to Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1968 funeral. There’s even a tape of him discussing the room itself, which reveals a certain power dynamic in his and Lucille’s relationship: “She gave me a room and made a den out of it,” he says. “You know what I mean? That really knocked me out.” Growing up, he continues, “we couldn’t afford no den . . . we’d rather sleep in that room.”\nHOW IS IT possible that this house has remained so perfectly intact? And why is it so little known? (The home, which opened to the public in 2003, gets about 18,000 visitors each year; Elvis Presley’s Graceland in Memphis, by comparison, draws about 600,000 people annually.) The second question can be explained partly by its location in Corona, a neighborhood that, unless you live here, takes some work to get to.\nThe first question is more complicated. It certainly helped that the Armstrongs had no children, though it’s still remarkable that the house wasn’t completely picked over following Armstrong’s death. (His 1971 funeral, for which Frank Sinatra and Dick Cavett were among the honorary pallbearers, was held in nearby Flushing Cemetery and drew thousands of spectators.) Much of the credit for its preservation is due to Lucille; after her husband died, she abandoned her desires for a fancier home and became the primary caretaker of his legacy. She stayed in the house until her own death in 1983, at age 69, and left it to the city; since 1987, it has been run by Queens College, which also owns Armstrong’s archives. The college had the foresight to put Lucille’s longtime housekeeper, Bessie Williams, whom she hired in 1972, on the payroll, and every couple of weeks, she’d clean the house as she always had; she retired not long before the house opened as a museum.\nBut the other factor was Armstrong himself, who despite dropping out of school in the fifth grade had a scholar’s proclivity for saving and indexing. His archive houses his trumpets, his library (which includes “War and Peace,” “Of Mice and Men” and the Bible), the original score from the first recording of “What a Wonderful World” in 1967 and also stranger fare: There’s a 1959 manuscript of a treatise on marijuana (“gage, as they so beautifully call it sometimes,” he writes in the opening sentence); boxes of Franz Schuritz lip salve, which he used prolifically enough (the trumpet was hard on Armstrong’s mouth) to receive a lifetime supply from the company; and a personally compiled joke book that includes an extensive index of punch lines (“Them ears,” “Prostate massage” and so on). Ricky Riccardi, who runs the Armstrong archive, said of this penchant for collecting and organizing: “He was very humble, he didn’t have an ego, but he was very self-aware of his accomplishments. He wanted to be the one to tell his own story.” The house, then, became its own archive, a record of his life off the road.\nRiccardi recounted a story about how, during the postwar years, Armstrong would visit Chicago for gigs and stay at the Palmer House hotel downtown. When word would get out, as it always did, that Armstrong was in town, a line would form outside his room, and Armstrong would listen to people’s hardships and give them money: $20 here, $50, sometimes as much as $500. When Armstrong’s manager, Joe Glaser, asked why he’d give away money like that, Armstrong responded, “Money? What do I need money for? They’re gonna write about me in the history books one day.”"}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/world-battles-to-stop-the-spread-of-the-corona-virus/av-52546086", "title": "World battles to stop the spread of the corona virus | DW News - latest news and breaking stories | DW", "text": "For the first time, officials are reporting more new infections outside China than in.

Read the latest updates in the coronavirus outbreak here.\nCommunist Party ousts provincial leader at the center of the outbreak.\nChina’s ruling Communist Party fired the leader of the province at the center of the new coronavirus outbreak on Thursday amid widespread public anger over the handling of the epidemic.\nJiang Chaoliang, the party secretary of Hubei Province, is the highest-ranking official to lose his job over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 1,100 people in recent weeks.\nMr. Jiang will be replaced by Ying Yong, the mayor of Shanghai. The selection of Mr. Ying may underline the continued political control of Xi Jinping, China’s top leader. Before being transferred to Shanghai in a fairly senior role in 2008, Mr. Ying had come up through the political ranks in Zhejiang Province, which is Mr. Xi’s political base as well.\nAfter the outbreak first emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, the leadership came under intense scrutiny for playing down the virus and delaying reports of its spread. The province then took drastic measures that included imposing a lockdown not only on Wuhan but also on tens of millions of people in surrounding areas.\nFor hospitals in Wuhan, already overwhelmed with patients, that cordon worsened a shortage of medical supplies that has continued.\nA surge in new cases and deaths as diagnostic tools expand.\nEarly on Thursday, officials announced that nearly 15,000 new cases and 242 new deaths were recorded in a single day in Hubei Province, the center of the coronavirus outbreak, largely because the authorities there had expanded their diagnostic tools for counting new infections.\nUntil now, only infections confirmed by specialized testing kits were considered accurate. But those kits have been in such short supply — and so many sick people have gone untested — that the authorities in Hubei have started counting patients whose illness have been screened and identified by doctors.\nThe result was a sudden — and large — spike in the overall tally for the coronavirus: more than 1,300 people killed and well over 50,000 infected.\nThe change in how cases are counted is only one factor that has made it difficult for experts to determine the true scale of the epidemic. In fact, the shifting landscape of how infections are defined and confirmed has led to significant variations in the estimates for the extent of outbreak.\nJapan says it will let some people off a quarantined cruise ship, as cases rise to 218.\nAs Japan announced 44 new coronavirus cases on a cruise ship quarantined in the waters off Yokohama, bringing the total to 218, the country’s health minister said on Thursday that the authorities would begin allowing some passengers to disembark and serve out the remainder of the quarantine period on shore.\nThe minister, Katsunobo Kato, said that, if they first test negative for the virus, passengers 80 or older, those with existing medical conditions and those assigned to cabins without windows or balconies would be taken to facilities for confinement until the quarantine is scheduled to end on Feb. 19. Those who test positive will be taken to hospitals.\nOf the newly confirmed cases, Mr. Kato said, 43 were passengers and one was a crew member.\nThe cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, arrived in Yokohama on Feb. 3, and passengers were expecting to go home the next day. But after learning that a man who got off the ship in Hong Kong had tested positive for the coronavirus, the Japanese government quarantined all 3,700 passengers and crew members on board. The quarantine period is scheduled to last for two weeks.\nSeparately, the Cambodian government said on Wednesday it would allow another cruise ship, the Westerdam, to dock in Sihanoukville. The ship had been denied permission to stop in Japan, Guam, Taiwan and the Philippines, despite having no diagnoses of coronavirus.\n‘All engagements of His Holiness the Dalai Lama remain indefinitely postponed.’\nThe Dalai Lama has canceled his public events because of the coronavirus outbreak, his office says.\n“As a precautionary measure, in view of the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, all engagements of His Holiness the Dalai Lama remain indefinitely postponed,” a statement says.\nOn March 9, the Dalai Lama was scheduled to appear at a teaching event in Dharamsala, India.\nNo other events appear on the schedule.\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak\n- Coronavirus cases rise in India as lockdown eases.\n- In a town split by a border, virus rules vary from door to door.\n- Caught violating his own social-distancing advice, a top British scientist quits a government panel.\nThe Dalai Lama’s office has also issued an appeal, urging Tibetans across the world to “collectively pray for the speedy resolution to the crisis and the well-being of humanity.”\nThe coronavirus outbreak has infected more than 45,000 people in Asia, according to statements from health officials. India, where the Dalai Lama lives, has at least three confirmed cases so far, according to the World Health Organization.\nA big tech show has been canceled.\nOne of the world’s biggest technology trade shows was canceled on Wednesday as the coronavirus outbreak continued to disrupt the global business calendar.\nEvery year since 2006, Mobile World Congress has drawn representatives of major tech companies to Barcelona to gather in giant conference halls to launch products, hobnob with industry luminaries and discuss deals and partnerships. The event typically draws more than 100,000 attendees from nearly 200 countries across the world. This year’s event was scheduled to begin later this month.\nBut on Wednesday, the industry group that organizes the trade show, the Global System for Mobile Communications Association, said it was canceling the event because of “the coronavirus outbreak, travel concern and other circumstances.”\nThe cancellation of the show became inevitable when major companies including Nokia, Ericsson and Vodafone pulled out. The association had announced safety measures to try to keep the show on track, including not admitting people who had been to affected parts of China.\nLast year, Mobile World Congress carried political significance when the U.S. government sent a delegation to warn wireless companies against using equipment sold by the Chinese tech giant Huawei.\nCanceling the event is a blow to the city of Barcelona, which has hosted the conference for years and enjoys a strong economic boost from the thousands of attendees putting their company expense accounts to work at restaurants, hotels and corporate events.\nUnited Airlines extends its suspension of flights to mainland China.\nUnited Airlines said Wednesday that it would not resume flights connecting the United States with mainland China and Hong Kong until April 24, extending an earlier suspension, after a similar announcement by American Airlines.\nDemand for such flights declined sharply in late January as concern over the severity of the coronavirus outbreak began to take hold, according to data from the Airlines Reporting Corporation, an industry-owned transaction clearinghouse.\nIn the first few weeks of January, sales of tickets from the United States to mainland China were down slightly compared to the same weeks the year before, but by the fourth week of January, demand was down 59 percent year over year. Ticket refunds that week were up 534 percent, according to data based on 1.8 million tickets sold in January 2019 and 2020.\nThe C.D.C. says some coronavirus test kits are faulty.\nSome of the coronavirus testing kits sent to states have flaws and do not work properly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.\nThe C.D.C. began sending the kits to states to allow them to conduct their own testing and get results faster than they would by shipping samples to the C.D.C. in Atlanta. The failure of the kits means that states still have to depend on the C.D.C., which will delay results by several days.\nOn trial runs in some states, the kits produced results that were “inconclusive,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news conference on Wednesday.\nDr. Messonnier told reporters that the kits had been sent to 30 other countries as well, but said later Wednesday that she was mistaken.\nThere have been 13 confirmed cases of the infection in patients in the United States so far.\nFor one Chinese traveler, paradise is more like purgatory.\nWhat was supposed to be a short detour on her way to begin another semester of studies in Australia has turned into an anxious limbo for one Chinese student when that country joined others in banning travelers arriving from mainland China.\nNow, Iris Yao must wait on Jeju Island, off the coast of South Korea. According to the current regulations, she cannot make her way to Australia until she has been out of China for at least 14 days. Alone in a foreign country and made to feel like a pariah has left Ms. Yao, 22, depressed and frustrated.\nShe is one of tens of thousands of Chinese travelers whose plans have been upset by rapidly changing regulations thrown up across the region as the coronavirus has spread.\nMs. Yao arrived on the resort island last month for a short stay on her way back to her university in Sydney, Australia, from her hometown in Zhoushan, China. Since then, she has been virtually marooned on Jeju Island, known for its white sand beaches and volcanic landscape.\nIt might be slice of paradise, but she has not found it relaxing. Instead of the warm welcome once extended to wealthy Chinese tourists, the island’s locals have met Ms. Yao and other Chinese visitors with worry, discrimination and fear.\nSome restaurants on the resort island have banned Chinese citizens. Employees at one asked her not to speak Mandarin while eating there, fearing she would scare away customers.\n“The fear toward the virus is everywhere,” she said. “I think it’s unfair for all Chinese citizens; they are not allowed to go into restaurants or cannot speak Mandarin.”\nLondon has its first coronavirus case.\nLondon is experiencing its first case of coronavirus, the British authorities said on Wednesday.\nThe patient, who is the United Kingdom’s ninth case, contracted the virus in China and is being treated at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in London.\nBritain has confirmed nine cases of coronavirus infections, with five believed to be linked to a British businessman who may have contracted the virus in Singapore. The man, Steve Walsh, is believed to be the cause of five additional cases in France.\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Walsh released a statement saying he has been released from the hospital and returned home, even as public health officials continue to try to trace the contacts of some of the people he is believed to have infected.\nThe strategic incident director of Britain’s National Health Service, Prof. Keith Willett, said Mr. Walsh had developed only “mild” symptoms of the virus and had made a full recovery.\n“He is no longer contagious and poses no risk to the public,” Professor Willett said in a statement. “He is keen to return to his normal life and spend time with his family out of the media spotlight.”\nChina directed local leaders to resume production.\nThe Chinese authorities have approved a broad strategy for trying to bring the coronavirus outbreak under control while restarting economic production, state news outlets reported Wednesday evening.\nPresident Xi Jinping ordered that tax cuts be drafted and put into effect.\nPremier Li Keqiang, the country’s No. 2 official, and the country’s cabinet called for major construction projects to begin across the country as soon as possible.\nState-owned enterprises were told to cut rents. Banks were ordered to keep interest rates low.\nCity governments were told to make sure that workers who went home for the Lunar New Year holiday could reach their jobs.\nThe two most powerful political bodies in China — the Standing Committee of the Communist Party Politburo and the government’s cabinet of ministers — each issued similar orders. Both groups produced hints of the fairly broad stimulus program that many economists expect soon.\nNone of the announcements directly addressed the difficult balancing act that China now faces: how to put more than 700 million workers back on the job without creating conditions that could allow the virus to spread.\n.\nWith classes suspended, educators in China scramble to keep students engaged.\nThe Ministry of Education in China instructed schools on Wednesday to find ways to keep the country’s 190 million primary and secondary students busy during the suspension of the school year, but it discouraged any significant efforts to provide classes online.\nIn a notice posted on its website, the ministry urged provincial school administrators to draw up detailed study plans for students who, like everyone else, are largely confined to their homes.\nThe ministry encouraged reading and physical exercises and, if possible, online tutoring, though it also warned that primary-school students especially should not spend too much time online. It also announced that special programing on China’s national education television channel, CETV 4, would begin next week; the network had a similar role during the SARS epidemic in 2003.\nThe coronavirus epidemic that began in Wuhan has now thrown the country’s schools and universities into chaos. Some provinces, including Liaoning and Sichuan, plan to reopen primary and secondary schools on Feb. 17, at least for now, while others have already postponed the school year until at least March, including Shanghai, Zhejiang and Guangdong.\nThe delays could have the greatest impact on those students preparing for the major national exams for high school and college held at the end of spring.\nThe State Department is allowing some employees to leave Hong Kong.\nThe United States will allow nonemergency consulate employees in Hong Kong and their families to leave because of the coronavirus outbreak, a State Department official said on Wednesday.\nThe decision to allow voluntary departures was made in response to continuing uncertainty surrounding the outbreak and practical considerations such as school closings, the official said.\nThe consulate in Hong Kong will remain open and continue to provide regular services.\nA similar decision was made to allow nonemergency State Department personnel and their families to leave mainland China in late January.\nThe State Department chartered flights and evacuated about 850 people from Wuhan, where the outbreak began late last year, including employees of the United States Consulate in the city.\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak\nThe virus has infected more than 3,637,200 people in at least 177 countries.\nHong Kong has 50 confirmed coronavirus cases and one death. The State Department’s travel advisory for the city is at Level 2, the second-lowest of four levels, and recommends that visitors to Hong Kong “exercise increased caution” because of the outbreak.\nThis month, the warning for mainland China was raised to 4, the highest level.\n“Do not travel to China due to the novel coronavirus,” it said.\nDisrupted supply chains are sending a ripple effect across the globe.\nThe coronavirus outbreak in China has generated economic waves that are rocking commodities markets and disrupting the supply networks that act as the backbone of the global economy.\nIn Australia, after hauling hundreds of thousands of tons of iron ore to China, returning freighters can face a 14-day quarantine.\nOne of the world’s largest copper mining companies, BHP, has been in talks to possibly delay shipments to Chinese ports.\nAnd China is turning back deliveries of liquefied natural gas, potentially disrupting shipments from Qatar to Indonesia.\n“We’re seeing a rippling out,” said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. “And we don’t see it stopping.”\nPrices for key industrial raw materials such as copper, iron ore, nickel, aluminum and liquid natural gas have plummeted since the virus emerged.\nAnd manufacturers, mining companies and commodity producers of all stripes are weighing whether they will be forced to cut back on production for fear of adding to a growing inventory glut.\nAirbnb cancels bookings in Beijing.\nAirbnb will suspend bookings in Beijing until May 1, the company said on Wednesday.\nThe decision was made “in accordance with guidance issued by the government to all companies in the short-term rental industry,” a spokesman for the company said. He added that existing reservations would be refunded.\nAirbnb has also waived cancellation fees for travel to and from mainland China until the end of February. Travelers who had booked stays in Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak, can cancel reservations without charge until April 1.\nThe company had continued to accept reservations throughout China during the busy travel season before and after the Lunar New Year holiday, even as the government started to lock down cities and impose road restrictions to stop the spread of the virus.\nThe company also said it would set aside $10 million “to support hosts in the next few years, during the recovery period of the local tourism industry.”\nReporting and research was contributed by Amber Wang, Zoe Mou, Albee Zhang, Yiwei Wang, Claire Fu, Amy Qin, Sui-Lee Wee, Steven Lee Myers, Keith Bradsher, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, Matt Phillips, Austin Ramzy, Tiffany May, Elian Peltier, Yonette Joseph, Megan Specia, Heather Murphy, Iliana Magra, Niraj Chokshi and Ceylan Yeginsu."}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-germany-cases/number-of-coronavirus-cases-in-germany-rises-to-42288-rki-idUSKBN21E0IX", "title": "Number of coronavirus cases in Germany rises to 42 , 288 : RKI", "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Germany has risen to 42,288 and 253 people have died of the disease, statistics from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Friday.\nCases rose by 5,780 compared with the previous day while the death toll climbed by 55, the tally showed.\nReporting by Scot W.

Today it influences not only Americans’ decisions at the ballot box, but also their views on race, immigration, the environment and helping the poor. Even scientific beliefs now fall along partisan lines. As Americans face the threat of a pandemic of covid-19, will their political beliefs affect how they respond?\nA new poll conducted by YouGov, a pollster, on behalf of The Economist suggests that party loyalties do matter. In the survey, carried out between March 8th and 10th, 61% of Democrats said they were “very” or “somewhat” worried about personally contracting the coronavirus; only 37% of Republicans shared this fear. Indeed 24% of Republicans said they were “not worried at all” about catching the virus.\nDemocrats are taking more preventative measures, too. Some 23% of Democrats have cancelled travel plans, compared with just 14% of Republicans. The share of survey respondents who said they had worked from home was 19% and 9% for Democrats and Republicans, respectively. Moreover, 9% of Democrats have donned a medical face mask in public; only 5% of Republicans have done the same.\nOpinions about how the government should respond to the crisis are even more sharply divided. About half of Democrats said people should be required to work from home; roughly a third said large public gatherings and long-distance travel should be cancelled; and one in five said schools and universities should be temporarily closed. Republicans were less supportive of every one of these measures. Only on the proposal to quarantine people returning from places hit by the virus were they as enthusiastic as their Democratic counterparts.\nWhy are liberals so fearful of covid-19, and conservatives so blasé? Past studies have found that Democrats are more likely than Republicans to trust scientists, who have sounded various alarms over the coronavirus. Meanwhile President Donald Trump and Fox News, the most polarising sources of information on the right, had until recently characterised the virus as no more serious than the common flu. That changed on March 11th when the president announced sweeping measures to deal with the pandemic, including suspending travel from much of Europe for 30 days.

In moments of optimism, its staffers hope that regulations that have been suspended during the pandemic, such as impediments to telemedicine, practicing medicine across state lines, and selling to-go cocktails, will be exposed as needless and abolished for good. More often, they worry that through abuse or incompetence, the state will do more harm than good in the present emergency.\nThe magazine’s editor, Katherine Mangu-Ward, worries that the Department of Justice will abuse the crisis to undermine the rights of criminal defendants, that local authorities will be discriminatory when enforcing lockdown measures, and that attempts at central economic planning, like invoking the Defense Production Act, will eliminate vital price signals that help markets meet human needs.\nJane Chong: How to actually use the Defense Production Act\n“AtReason, a core part of our mission is talking about ways that progress and innovation come from places outside of and separate from the state, and staying attentive to the sometimes-hidden costs that different government actions and regulations can impose,” she told me. “Already in this pandemic, we’ve seen individuals turning their lives or their businesses on a dime to promote crucial social goods. We’re worried about anything that would get in the way of that.”\nHer list of worries is accordingly long and varied.\nIn the near term, she worries about possible limits on interstate travel. “We all know that it’s wrong to restrict people from traveling within the United States––that’s part of our deal here as a country,” she elaborated. “But where exactly is that in the Constitution? That’s a tricky question. What will the outcomes and precedents be if that question is tested in the courts because governors weren’t able to reach harmonious decisions about when to restart normal economic life?”\nShe also worries about centralized health-care rationing. “It is genuinely horrific that we as a nation are potentially facing thousands of trolley problems. But this isn’t the first time that nations or hospitals have had to make decisions about how to use scarce, lifesaving resources,” she said. “I consider myself a utilitarian libertarian, and it is important to me to try to maximize good outcomes. But I recognize other people disagree. So to me, the question should be answered as locally as possible...The people making the decisions should ideally be as close as possible to those who will suffer harm when they don’t get the resources. It makes me nervous thinking of Donald Trump making these decisions for the entire nation, and more comfortable letting individual physicians or hospitals make them.”"}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/19/this-robot-is-being-used-in-china-to-protect-medics-from-coronavirus", "title": "This robot is being used in China to protect medics from coronavirus", "text": "Meet the robot that has been deployed in China amid the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.\nXiao Bao goes around restricted wards at Haidian Hospital, Beijing, where suspected and infected patients are staying.\nRemotely controlled by medical workers, it delivers medications, takes temperatures and spends time educating patients about medical precautions.\nDong Jianping, director at the hospital's department of infectious diseases, said having the robot means a huge stone is lifted off her heart as staying too long in the restricted wards poses high risks for medical workers.\nThe best thing about the robot, Dong said, is that doctors and patients can now speak to patients via Xiao Bao for a longer time than they could in person.\nHaidian Hospital is among the first in China's capital city to employ the robot amid the epidemic outbreak.\nThe hospital is also experimenting with the usage of disinfectant robots and other service robots.

Some claim social distancing is pointless, since covid-19’s elderly victims would soon have died of other causes. In Britain many pundits have said that two-thirds of the country’s dead were already within a year of passing away. They cite an estimate made in March by Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London who advises the government.\nMr Ferguson notes that two-thirds was the upper bound of his estimate, and that the real fraction could be much lower. He says it is “very hard” to measure how ill covid-19’s victims were before catching it, and how long they might have lived otherwise. However, a study by researchers from a group of Scottish universities has attempted to do so. They found that the years of life lost (YLLs) for the average Briton or Italian who passed away was probably around 11, meaning that few of covid-19’s victims would have died soon otherwise.\nFirst the authors analysed data for 6,801 Italian victims, grouped by age and sex for confidentiality. About 40% of men were older than 80, as were 60% of women. (The virus has killed fewer women than men, perhaps because they have different immune responses.) The authors excluded the 1% of victims under 50. Then they calculated how much longer these cohorts would normally survive. Life expectancies for old people are surprisingly high, even when they have underlying conditions, because many of the unhealthiest have already passed away. For example, an average Italian 80-year-old will reach 90. The YLLs from this method were 11.5 for Italian men and 10.9 for women.\nThen the authors accounted for other illnesses the victims had, in case they were unusually frail for their age. For 710 Italians, they could see how many had a specific long-term condition, such as hypertension or cancer. The authors used a smaller Scottish sample to estimate how often each combination of diseases occurs among covid-19 victims. Finally, they analysed data for 850,000 Welsh people, to predict how long somebody with a given age and set of conditions would normally live.\nStrikingly, the study shows that in this hybrid European model, people killed by covid-19 had only slightly higher rates of underlying illness than everyone else their age. When the authors adjusted for pre-existing conditions and then simulated deaths using normal Italian life expectancies, the YLLs dropped just a little, to 11.1 for men and 10.2 for women. (They were slightly lower for Britons.) Fully 20% of the dead were reasonably healthy people in their 50s and 60s, who were expected to live for another 25 years on average.\nThe researchers warn that their data exclude people who died in care homes, who might have been especially sickly. Nor can they account for the severity of underlying illnesses. For example, covid-19 victims might have had particularly acute lung or heart conditions. More complete data could produce a lower estimate of YLLs. Mr Ferguson also points out that tallies of all-cause mortality will contain clues. If the pandemic has merely hastened imminent deaths, there should be fewer than usual once covid-19 is under control.\nStill, the available evidence suggests that many covid-19 victims were far from death’s door previously, and cut down at least a decade before their time. Allowing the virus to spread freely would sacrifice the strong as well as the weak. ■\nSources: \"Covid-19 – exploring the implications of long-term condition type and extent of multimorbidity on years of life lost: a modelling study\", by P Hanlon, F Chadwick, A Shah et al., 2020; Istituto Superiore di Sanità (Italy); SAIL Databank (Wales); Public Health Scotland\nThis article appeared in the Graphic detail section of the print edition under the headline \"Before their time\""}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-hit-japan-limits-large-gatherings-11582282621", "title": "Coronavirus - Hit Japan Limits Large Gatherings", "text": "- World\n- Asia\n- Japan\nJapan Limits Large Gatherings to Thwart Coronavirus\nGraduations, speeches, business meetings are canceled, Tokyo Marathon shrinks\nTOKYO—Japan has begun suspending major public gatherings to counter the spread of Covid-19 as the number of new cases rises quickly and makes the country one of the biggest sites of infection outside China.\nOn Friday, the Tokyo metropolitan government said it wouldn’t hold large events such as school graduation ceremonies and entrance examinations for three weeks through mid-March, based on the advice of experts.

David Ige said at a news conference. Mr. Ige said the situation was of serious concern, but that the state was prepared to deal with it.\nThe man fell ill during the second week of his vacation in Hawaii. At the time, officials said, the couple was staying at a time-share in Honolulu, on the island of Oahu. Before that, the couple had been in Maui, but the man showed no symptoms while he was there. It remained unclear if the woman showed any symptoms while on vacation.\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S.\n- A deep recession and ballooning unemployment in Europe darken the global economic picture.\n- President Trump pushes to reopen the economy as new reports illustrate fragmented federal response.\n- Comparing recent deaths to historical figures hints at the real toll in each U.S. state.\nOfficials said that the man began showing signs of illness on Feb. 3, and wore a mask when he went outside the time-share, the Grand Waikikian by Hilton Grand Vacations, in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu. Representatives for Hilton did not respond to a message seeking more information.\nSeveral days later, on Feb. 7, the couple returned to Nagoya, Japan’s fourth-largest city. A day later, the man visited a hospital after developing a fever, but he was not admitted, Japan’s health ministry said. He learned he had pneumonia two days later, but was again released from a hospital.\nOn Thursday, he was taken in an ambulance to a hospital for the third time, and Hawaii health officials learned on Friday morning that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. His wife also went to the hospital on Friday with a fever, and on Saturday, she was also confirmed to have the virus.\nDr. Sarah Park, the state epidemiologist for the Hawaii Department of Health, said that the man was most likely infected either before he came to Hawaii or while he was on his way to Hawaii in late January. He did not have symptoms of the coronavirus while he was on Maui, officials said, and he wore a mask on the plane when he returned to Japan.\n“I don’t believe the man was significantly infectious,” Lt. Gov. Josh Green, who is an emergency physician, said in an interview on Friday. “He could not transmit the virus, because he was not symptomatic at the time he was on the island.”\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that while it may be possible to spread the virus before showing symptoms, it is much more likely to spread after symptoms begin.\nThe lieutenant governor said that the authorities were contacting the management at the guest facilities where the couple stayed, as well as those who were working there.\n“The only way to do this right is to contact everyone,” he said. “We are not worried about minimal contact, but those who had extensive contact will be given whatever support is necessary.”\nHe said state health officials were focusing on anyone who might have been in contact with the man after Jan. 27.\nThe coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, has sickened more than 66,000 people worldwide, the vast majority in China, and killed at least 1,523 since the outbreak began in the city of Wuhan, China.

And anyone familiar with the coast of Croatia will know that finding towel room on its increasingly crowded beaches is a challenge.\nBut the coronavirus pandemic threatens to ruin the summer season, so vital to the economies of both countries, even though they moved fast to stop the spread. Their proximity to Italy concentrated minds, as Covid-19 started spreading rapidly.\nHow did they react?\nCroatia was on alert soon after news of the Covid-19 epidemic emerged from China.\nThe Institute of Public Health had published guidelines even before the arrival of a busload of tourists from Wuhan in late January.\nLocal media raised concerns that Chinese workers constructing the Peljesac Bridge on the Dalmatian coast might have returned from virus-affected areas in China.\n- What travel might look like before a vaccine\nIn Greece, too, the government moved well before the virus reached its shores, as it saw infections spread in Italy. An ad-hoc scientific committee was set up with top epidemiologists, virologists and infectious disease experts.\nSome accused the government in Athens of not just entrusting the handling of the pandemic to scientists, but of handing over responsibility too.\nWhen did lockdown start?\nThe first confirmed Croatian case came on 25 February, almost a month after Italy and the UK. It involved a man who had been in Milan six days earlier to see the now-notorious Champions League match between Atalanta and Valencia.\nThe match has been linked to one of Italy's biggest outbreaks - in Bergamo, where Atalanta are based.\nThe first confirmed case in Greece was recorded a day later than Croatia, on 26 February. And both countries reacted swiftly.\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis imposed tighter restrictions over a period of weeks and it was made clear that no exceptions could be made:\n- 27 February: carnival festivities are cancelled\n- 10 March: schools and universities are closed\n- 12 March: Olympic flame is lit in Ancient Olympia with a handful of VIP guests; Greece confirms first Covid-19 death\n- 13 March: cafes and restaurants are shut\n- 22 March: restrictions on movement imposed\nGreeks have since been allowed out of their homes only for essential work, buying food or walking the dog.\nIt became more difficult to enter Croatia immediately after its first case. Although an EU member, it is not yet part of the Schengen border-free area. So, despite protests from neighbouring Slovenia, it had no compunction about imposing \"health checks\" at border crossings.\nBy the end of February, a border queue of freight traffic stretched back for miles.\nRestrictions tightened rapidly. Within two weeks, arrivals from 18 countries would find themselves confined to quarantine or self-isolation if they entered Croatia.\nThere were internal measures to match. Most commercial and cultural activity had ceased by mid-March. And on 23 March people were confined to their neighbourhoods unless they obtained an \"e-pass\" to travel.\nGreek enforcement was strict too. More than 60,000 fines were issued for violating the lockdown which, according to Greek police, totalled €9,247,800 (£8.1m).\nAll this seems to have restricted the spread of Covid-19. Croatia's death rate currently stands at 18 per million, while Greece's stands at 13 per million.\nHow Greece handled Easter\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the Greek government came from the country's religious tradition. According to Greek Orthodox ritual, priests offer holy communion using the same spoon.\nThe Church of Greece's leadership insisted for days that diseases could not be contracted from communion, which represents the blood and body of Jesus. Doctors and scientists immediately called on the Church to listen to science.\nThe prime minister intervened with an emotional, televised speech. \"Personally, in recent days I felt the need to invoke my faith in order to draw strength and stand up to the challenges,\" said Mr Mitsotakis. However, he said he had to \"listen to scientists\". \"What applies to public gatherings will also apply to churches.\"\nAs a result, and with only a handful of hiccups, all church Easter liturgies took place behind closed doors.\n- What Boris Johnson's Greek hero teaches us about epidemics\n- The family isolating in a van on a Greek Island\n- Coronavirus: Can I get a holiday refund?\nCan they rescue summer?\nNow Croatia and Greece are moving to a gradual easing of those restrictions.\nFor Croatia the problem is no longer how to keep foreigners out, but to bring them back in. About half of Croatia's 20 million annual visitors arrive in July and August and tourism is responsible for at least a fifth of its economic output.\nThose are the crucial months for Greece's tourist industry too. This year's motto, says Tourism Minister Haris Theocharis, is that Greece is coronavirus-safe.\nThe Greek economy had only just begun to recover from an eight-year financial crisis when the lockdown was imposed.\nTourism accounts for approximately 25% of Greek GDP and one in five jobs, so a new crisis is looming: 65% of Greek hoteliers say bankruptcy of their business is either \"likely\" or \"most likely\", according to a study by the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels.\nGreek scientists are working on health requirements for visitors, the tourism minister says. \"The basic principles behind the new rules are that social distancing will be required, and that more frequent and different kinds of cleaning procedures are to be followed.\"\nIn other words, hotel staff will be tested regularly to ensure tourists and Greeks themselves are protected.\nWhy Croatia needs open borders\nCroatia needs co-operation from its neighbours, Slovenia in particular.\nSlovenians rank second only to Germans in terms of the number of nights they spend in Croatia. If you travel by road from Northern Europe you have to cross Slovenia to reach the beaches of Istria, Dalmatia and the Kvarner Gulf.\nThe two countries' tourism ministers met in Zagreb last week to sketch out a plan to allow Slovenians to travel across Croatia's borders by the end of this month, with other nationalities following in June.\nCzech travel agencies are keen to establish a \"corona corridor\" enabling quarantine-free travel to the coast, a plan warmly received by Croatia's prime minister, Andrej Plenkovic. A survey in Austria too has indicated that people are still hoping to bask in the Croatian sun.\nUncertainty over air travel\nWith big questions over when holiday flights will resume, Greece too is initially looking for tourists who can reach the country by road.\nIt is currently focused on getting the EU to set common rules that would allow people to travel for holidays.\nBut if there is no consensus, Greece is prepared to go it alone, in order to \"open up our economic activity as soon as possible and in a health-wise manner\", says Mr Theocharis.\n\"We will first see domestic tourism, then tourists from neighbouring countries, and then middle-distance countries and long-distance ones. Travelling by road will be safer initially than flying and we'll see that kind of tourists earlier.\"\nTraditional markets like Germany, the UK and the US may well be replaced by countries that are both closer and have not been hit hard by the pandemic.\nThis may seem like an odd time to be thinking about holidays. But these are both countries with tourism-reliant economies and, having acted swiftly and thoroughly, a successful summer could be seen as a fitting reward.\n- A SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?\n- AVOIDING CONTACT: The rules on self-isolation and exercise\n- WHAT WE DON'T KNOW How to understand the death toll\n- TESTING: Can I get tested for coronavirus?\n- LOOK-UP TOOL: Check cases in your area"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-costs-whos-paying-for-all-this-11583317801", "title": "Coronavirus Costs : Who Paying for All This ?

This week, it was simple. TIME reports on the people who shape the world, and the cover often features the most influential among them: heads of state, titans of industry, icons of culture.\nYet today, even the most powerful people in our society are at the mercy of a virus that knows no rank and no title. Though some in politics and business have risen to the occasion, and some countries—like Taiwan and South Korea—have managed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, many governments around the globe have been on their heels, ignoring years of warnings about the threat of pandemic and then wasting precious time in fighting this virus’s spread. Meanwhile, the kinds of international collaboration that have helped lead the world through previous crises are virtually absent.\nAnd so this fight is being waged in large measure by frontline responders, from the medical workers risking their lives to the delivery people and pharmacy employees who aren’t able to stay in their homes to the coroners who are confronting wartime body counts. This issue is dedicated to them.\nKeep up to date on the growing threat to global health by signing up for our daily coronavirus newsletter.\nOn the cover, we feature five courageous individuals from across different regions. Inside, you’ll find their stories and those of dozens more around the world, often in their own words and illustrated with their own photographs. They are what influence looks like today.\nWhile frontline workers face significant danger in their work, reporting alongside them brings its own set of challenges. National correspondent Charlotte Alter spent a shift with Yonkers, N.Y., paramedic Alanna Badgley, and veteran war photographer Christopher Morris documented the overwhelming work of coroner Michael Fowler in Albany, Ga. We also asked photographer turned paramedic Danny Kim to document his harrowing experience over the course of a week responding to likely COVID-19 patients in New Jersey. “I really want our voices to be heard,” Kim says. “I want our story to be told from us directly.”\nWith TIME’s offices closed, working remotely has presented a host of obstacles, not the least of which includes creating video that is normally made with access to on-site servers and equipment. To accompany this issue, working with creativity and caution, our team created six rich videos told from the point of view of those immersed in the fight against this pandemic. Like the photographs in the magazine, much of the video footage was taken by the people on the front lines themselves. You can watch these videos at time.com/frontline-heroes.\nWe are also pleased to launch a new video collaboration between TIME and journalist Katie Couric, who will be interviewing frontline heroes and working with us to cover the health and wellness crisis that we’re all confronting together today.\nAs we put this issue together, our staff also felt it was important to look at what those of us who aren’t on the front line can do to help. Of course, the most important thing—as many of the first responders we spoke to reminded us—is to stay at home to slow the spread of COVID-19. But millions around the world are searching for ways to donate their time or money, and so our team has put together a list of charities and causes worth your attention.

None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:\n___\nCLAIM: Photo shows Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden kissing a young girl’s cheek.\nTHE FACTS: The photo is being misrepresented. The man in the photo is Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Posts circulating on social media are using an image of López Obrador kissing a young girl in an effort to cast Biden in a negative light. “Ladies and Gentlemen Let me introduce the Democratic Leader for the Presidency of the United States of America!!!!!! Joe Biden!!!!!,” one Facebook post falsely claimed. The miscaptioned photo had over 9,000 shares. “Hey Liberals, is this normal behavior.?? @joebiden #sundayvibes #SundayThoughts,” was the comment on a tweet. The image was taken from a video López Obrador tweeted on March 14. At the time, the Mexican president ignored social distancing rules and continued to engage in affectionate physical greetings. According to AP reporting, López Obrador met with crowds, where he shook hands with people and kissed cheeks. He was criticized for holding large rallies while dozens of coronavirus cases were confirmed in Mexico. In recent months, Biden has received scrutiny over his interactions with women. Over the years, Biden was shown on camera hugging or whispering to women at high-profile events. He’s defended his actions, saying he doesn’t believe he’s acted inappropriately with women.\n____\nCLAIM: Photo shows a woman at a California protest against stay-at-home orders holding a sign that says: “Barack 6 Hussein 7 Obama 5 COVID = 19 OPEN YOUR EYES.”\nTHE FACTS: Social media users are sharing an altered photo of a woman holding a sign at a protest against California stay-at-home orders earlier this month. The actual sign said: “Give me liberty or give me death,” a famous quote from Patrick Henry’s speech at the Virginia convention in 1775. The images are identical except for the sign carried by the woman, who is wearing an American flag tank top, hat and sunglasses. In the manipulated photo the woman’s sign spells out the full name of former President Barack Obama, placing a tally of the number of letters contained in each part of his name. An online conspiracy theory movement called QAnon often uses numbers associated with significant dates or the numbers of letters corresponding to a person’s name to promote baseless claims of an attempted coup against President Donald Trump’s presidency. In this case, social media users falsely claimed the woman was some linking the letters in Obama’s name to COVID-19, although the number of letters in his name only equals 18. Social media users posted the doctored image with comments mocking the woman for the math error. The original photo was taken during a protest in Huntington Beach, California, by Jeff Gritchen, a staff photographer for the Orange County Register. In an email, Gritchen confirmed the image had been edited and said he had seen the altered photo “getting a lot of traction online.”\n___\nCLAIM: Madagascar is the first country to succeed in finding a cure for COVID-19.\nTHE FACTS: Madagascar’s President Andry Rajoelina has been promoting an herbal drink called Covid Organics as a remedy for COVID-19, but there’s no scientific evidence to show it’s effective. Posts claiming the drink can “wipe out the virus at any stage” circulated on social media this week after some students returning to school in Madagascar were given face masks and a small bottle of the herbal extract to drink before going to class. Medical experts are critical of the drink, noting there are no scientific tests to indicate it would be effective against the novel coronavirus, according to AP reporting. Social media posts touting the drink emerged in late April after Rajoelina launched the product. “CORONA MEDICINE FOUND IN MADAGASCAR. The President of Madagascar Andry Rajovelina today was busy officially launching final medicine for Corona infection. The medicine is made from natural herbal mixes that wipe out the virus at any stage within a period of six days. Madagascar is the first country to succeed in finding a cure for its people, against the pandemic,” stated one Facebook post shared more than 3,000 times. The Malagasy Institute of Applied Research, an organization that has researched Madagascar’s traditional medicines for more than three decades, developed the drink. No ingredients are listed on the bottle, but according to the president, the drink is derived from artemisia, a bitterroot used in some malaria drugs. The country’s national medical academy has expressed concern over the drink. “The scientific evidence that this is effective has not been proved. It’s likely that it could actually harm the health of the population, particularly that of children,” Marcel Razanamparany, president of Madagascar’s Academy of Medicine, said in a statement. The U.S. National Institutes of Health also warned against the use of alternative medicines — including certain herbal therapies and teas — for treating or preventing COVID-19, saying there was no evidence they work and some may be unsafe. There are 128 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Madagascar and no deaths linked to the virus.\n___\nCLAIM: Videos surface of North Korean President Kim Jong Un’s body on display in a glass coffin.\nTHE FACTS: The videos were misrepresented. The images were captured in December 2011, and they show the body of Kim’s father, former North Korea President Kim Jong Il, lying in state in Pyongyang. Many of the images relied on AP photos and video from coverage of that funeral. The posts circulated on social media, claiming to show Kim Jong Un had died. Reports out of North Korea emerged Friday in the U.S. that he had made a public appearance. Rumors and reports about Kim Jong Un’s health emerged because of his prolonged public absence. The unconfirmed speculation suggested that Kim Jong Un might be dead or recently underwent a botched surgery. South Korea’s government had repeatedly rebuffed such reports.\n___\nCLAIM: Politicians receive full-pay retirement benefits even after serving only one term.\nTHE FACTS: Under federal law, members of Congress do not receive their full pay when they retire, and they must serve at least five years to be entitled to a pension. A post circulating on Facebook attempts to contrast what people who serve in the U.S military for 20 years receive when they retire compared to those who serve in Congress. “No one has been able to explain to me why young men and women who serve in the U.S. military for 20 years, risking their lives protecting freedom, and only get 50% of their base pay. While politicians hold their political positions in the safe confines of the capital, protected by these same men and women, and receive full pay retirement after serving 1 term,” states the post, which has been shared more than 73,000 times on Facebook alone. “Now, a federal employee pension is pretty generous by private sector standards, but that’s a completely different story from claiming that congressmen receive a full pension after one year on the job. They do not,” said Andrew G. Biggs, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. As for military benefits, Biggs said it is true that those who serve 20 years in the military get a pension equal to 50 percent of their base salary. Members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms, while Senators serve six-year terms. House members who leave after one term are not entitled to retirement benefits since they must serve at least five years. Congressmen and congressional staff get nearly the same pensions as other federal employees, said Biggs, who focuses on state and local government pensions. There are multiple retirement plans available to people who served in the military, depending on when they joined and how many years they served. Biggs noted that the military is trying to reform pensions. “It was seen as an unfair pension. They are trying to fix that to make it more fair between people at different career lengths,” he said. Since 2009, base pay for Representatives and Senators has been $174,000 each year. A congressional research report updated in August 2019 outlines pension plans for Congress members. “By law, the starting amount of a Member’s retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of his or her final salary,” the report states. Biggs said congressional pensions are more generous than federal employees since members of Congress and staff often lose their job as a result of elections. “To really get a great pension, you have to serve a long time,” Biggs said. “It’s still a good deal.”\n___\nCLAIM: Video shows the premier of Queensland, Australia, Annastacia Palaszczuk, faked getting a flu shot.\nTHE FACTS: Social media users are sharing an edited video clip that leaves out the part where Palaszczuk actually received the shot. When Queensland’s premier went before the media to publicize she was getting a flu shot Tuesday, it happened so fast a photographer had to ask for a do over. “I didn’t even feel it. It was over before it began,” Palaszczuk said after receiving the actual shot, which the medical worker reenacted with the needle covered. Social media users, including anti-vaccine supporters, are now sharing a shortened TikTok video that shows only the reenactment of the shot to suggest that government officials want everyone to get vaccinated but will not take the vaccines themselves. The TikTok video, which was shared hundreds of thousands of times on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, is overlaid with text that says, “Of course you didn’t feel it with the cap still on the needle.” 7News Brisbane, which covered the event, released the full footage on Twitter. It shows a medical worker wiping Palaszczuk arm before administering the vaccine and placing a Band-Aid over the location of the shot. A photographer then asked that the shot be reenacted and the woman repeated it with a cap on the needle. In the reenactment, the cap can be seen on the needle as the medical worker pretends to stick it into the premier’s arm. The video was aired during a segment on coronavirus cases in Queensland, which examined health experts’ concerns about the flu as winter weather approaches in Australia and social distancing measures ease up.\n___\nCLAIM: Nobel prize winner Dr. Tasuku Honjo said that the coronavirus is not natural and is completely artificial.\nTHE FACTS: Posts shared thousands of times on Facebook and WhatsApp in English and Spanish suggested Honjo “caused a sensation” by saying that the new coronavirus is not natural. No evidence could be found that Honjo ever made the comments attributed to him and he issued a statement denying he made them. The fabricated quote attributed to Dr. Honjo said: “If it is natural, it wouldn’t have adversely affected the entire world like this. Because, as per nature, temperature is different in different countries. If it was natural, it would have adversely affected only those countries having the same temperature as China. Instead, it is spreading in a country like Switzerland, in the same way it is spreading in the desert areas. Whereas if it were in fact natural, it would have spread in cold places, but died in hot places.” The text is accompanied by a photograph of the doctor and a link to his profile on Wikipedia. The Nobel Prize winner issued a statement on April 27 denying the posts on the website of Kyoto University, where he is a professor. Dr. Honjo won the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. “In the wake of the pain, economic loss, and unprecedented global suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am greatly saddened that my name and that of Kyoto University have been used to spread false accusations and misinformation,” he said in a statement. The theory that COVID-19 was created in a laboratory has been circulating on social media for months. However, scientists from around the world have carried out various analyses that have concluded that it is of animal origin. A study published on March 17 in one the world’s top journals, Nature, found that “SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.”\n___\nAbril Mulato in Mexico City contributed to this report.\n___\nThis is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\n___\nFind all AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck\n___\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck"}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/200m_paid_in_corporate_subsidies_entrepreneurs_group_wants_restaurants_to_re-open/11312914", "title": "€200m paid in corporate subsidies , entrepreneur group wants restaurants to re - open | Yle Uutiset", "text": "€200m paid in corporate subsidies, entrepreneurs’ group wants restaurants to re-open\nA small-business group says the government should consider re-opening restaurants in the coming weeks.\nThe state has so far handed out some 200 million euros in subsidies to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make it through the corona crisis, reports the news agency STT on Sunday.

For years Bridgewater’s famed risk-parity strategy produced high returns for low risk, and was widely adopted by others. But things soured when covid-19 hit. Mr Dalio reported losses of 7-21% across his funds in the first quarter, his biggest since late 2008.\nBridgewater created the first risk-parity portfolio in 1996, when it launched its All Weather fund. It was intended to be insulated from market-wide shocks. A typical way to do this is to balance holdings of relatively volatile stocks with government bonds—in times of market stress bonds usually rise in value, offsetting losses from stocks. But that means less exposure to equities, which tend to have higher returns. Bridgewater’s innovation was to keep a high allocation of stocks, but to borrow to buy safe long-dated bonds. If the long-dated interest rate is higher than the borrowing rate, as has generally been the case, this raises the total return on the portfolio, without adding extra risk.\nThe strategy’s success led others to follow. Assets allocated to the strategy probably exceeded $1trn in March, according to David Zervos of Jefferies, an investment bank. Risk parity’s outperformance during the global financial crisis was its making. The average annual return in the S&P risk-parity index in 2006-10 was 8%; by contrast, the S&P 500 equity index made nothing.\nAt first risk parity fared well during the corona-crisis. Between January 1st and March 13th the MSCI world share-price index fell by 20%. Safe assets were in high demand. In America the yield on the ten-year Treasury, which moves inversely to the price, dipped to a record low of 0.3% on March 9th. But then bond and share prices began to fall in tandem. Faced with an intense cash crunch, some investors sold their holdings of even liquid assets such as Treasuries. Risk-parity portfolios plunged in value.\nWith yields on Treasuries still low, proponents of risk parity are on the lookout for other ways to hedge risk. Mr Dalio reckons that government borrowing undertaken to support the economy during the pandemic will stoke inflation, making bonds less attractive to hold. Mr Zervos argues that investment-grade corporate bonds, which offer a return that is around two percentage points higher than government bonds, could be a substitute. The search for a new way to outperform begins.\nDig deeper:\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus tracker and story hub\nThis article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline \"Under the weather\""}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/40a3c411ff74ff0790773f8c662aa1b7", "title": "Global shares mostly lower as new China virus cases spike", "text": "Global shares fall as virus cases spike in China\nLONDON (AP) — Global shares mostly fell Thursday after China reported a spike in COVID-19 cases.

But the economic consequences of the coronavirus outbreak are already being felt on the continent.\nIn Africa, fear of a COVID-19 epidemic is growing. The economy is also in turmoil: no one knows how big the economic damage caused by the little-researched coronavirus will be. Small African companies that import food, technology or clothing from China — the country of origin of the COVID-19 virus — are already feeling the effects of the crisis.\nIf companies in the Far East remain closed or restrictions are imposed on Africans travelling to China, customers in Africa will be left out in the cold. Sales are falling dramatically. African exporters also fear the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak: China is Africa's largest market for crude oil and other raw materials.\nNigeria: No country imports more goods from China\nNigerianauthorities contacted about 100 people who may have been close to an Italian who is considered to be the first coronavirus patient in the country, according to the state health commissioner, Akin Abayomi.\nThe salesman of cement company Lafarge Africa PLC arrived in Nigeria's economic metropolis, Lagos, on February 24 by plane from Milan. He was being treated in a hospital in the Yaba district of Lagos where it is understood that 39 people who have been in direct contact with the man were also being quarantined.\nDespite the company announcing that its cement production lines remained open, there were fears that the virus could spread rapidly in a region where healthcare systems are already overwhelmed with cases of malaria, measles and Ebola. There are also other potential infection routes: Nigeria maintains intensive trade relations, especially with China.\nMoney exchange in Lagos: 'Many avoid touching bank notes at all.'\nNo other country in Africa consumes more Chinese products than Nigeria, said Alhaji Muhammad Dan Auta, spokesman for the Traders' Association in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna. \"Chinese products are usually found in all parts of Nigeria,\" he said.\nThe operator of a currency exchange office, according to his own statement, has suffered considerable losses in recent days: \"People are no longer coming to the exchange office to buy foreign currency because nobody wants to travel to China. They are all afraid to come into contact with the virus, so many avoid touching bank notes at all.\"\nMany business people in the region canceled overseas trips. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the import of Chinese products has declined noticeably. There are even sporadic shortages.\nRead more: Coronavirus: Global cases top 90,000\nUganda, Mozambique, Niger: Hardly any alternatives to goods from China\nThe situation in Uganda is similar: about a fourth of Ugandan imports come from China. Supply chains have been interrupted for weeks because many Chinese factories shut down production. Small traders selling textiles, electronics or household goods are in trouble.\nBusinessman Omar Kayiira from Kampala complained that many goods from China no longer arrive in Uganda. Alternative suppliers are very limited: \"There are Indian importers, but they don't have the products I sell. At the moment it is very difficult to replace the Chinese,\" Kayiira said.\nUgandan importer Ismail Kyeyuna added: \"We could try to buy the products we need in India or Dubai. But we would probably have similar problems, because the emirate also imports most of its products from China.\"\nCoronavirus controls at Lagos airport: other potential routes of infection\nChinese goods are also dominating the Mozambican markets. Many traders are worried that products from China will soon be in short supply. \"I might be able to buy textiles in other countries, for example in Brazil or Portugal,\" said Alzira Simbe, a businesswoman from Maputo. But there are certain products that she cannot find at reasonable prices in either Brazil or Portugal. Simbe usually travels to China several times a year to buy textiles, cosmetics and hair styling products. That is not possible at the moment.\nIn Niger, stocks of certain goods, including groceries, from China have already been significantly decimated, leading to higher prices, said Moussa Sidi Mohamed, president of the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \"Electronic products in particular are getting scarce.\" Many importers who normally fly to China regularly are currently unable to buy the goods they need due to entry restrictions.\nZimbabwe: Economic crisis intensifies\nZimbabwe also appears to be experiencing considerable supply shortages: \"Before the coronavirus outbreak, I ordered some goods from China. But they never arrived in Harare. Our customers are angry,\" said businessman Clifford Tsache, an electronics retailer from Zimbabwe. \"Nobody here knows when this nightmare will end.\"\nSince the South African country began its \"Look East Policy\" in 2004 — after a conflict with the West - many Zimbabweans travel to China to order cheap goods. Now, many traders consider flying to Tanzania to look for alternative supply sources.\nAngolan oil platform: 'Revenues have dropped dramatically'\nZimbabwe's struggling economy is not only heavily depending on cheap imports from China, said the importer. Zimbabwe mainly exports ores and other raw materials worth almost €900 million ($1,000 million) to China which is thus by far Zimbabwe's largest sales market. South Africa, Great Britain, India and Zambia follow far behind. Zimbabwe is one of 21 African countries that are dependent on the sale of raw materials to China.\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus in the far-off Chinese province of Wuhan in December is now worsening Zimbabwe's economic prospects, according to experts from the International Monetary Fund.\nAngola: Crash of oil exports to China\nAngola also suffers indirectly from the corona epidemic. The economy and finances of the country depend almost entirely on oil. The slowdown in trade with China due to the epidemic is affecting oil exports and jeopardizing the recovery of the country's struggling economy.\n\"Since China is Angola's largest oil importer, corona has a direct impact on the price of oil. Angola's revenues are falling dramatically,\" said Angolan economist Precioso Domingos. While rising oil prices would be an incentive to increase production and make new investments in the Angolan oil sector, falling prices, on the other hand, are \"poison to a fragile economy like that of Angola,\" the economist said.\n\"The coronavirus can be more harmful to countries like Angola in the medium term than to China itself.\" The resilience of the Chinese economy is far greater than the one of Angola, he said. \"We should look at the coronavirus with great concern,\" Domingos warned.\nDW sends out a daily selection of the day's news and features.

Yet humanity’s dramatic progress against specific infectious diseases has far outstripped the pace of investment in good health-care systems, responsive governance, dependable infrastructure, and the other more reliable guarantors of health. These basic factors are crucial, when a new disease such as COVID-19 suddenly emerges, in establishing how fast and how far it will spread and how may will perish because of it.\nThe progress against plagues and parasites throughout Europe and the United States in the 19th century extended globally after World War II with the increased availability of antibiotics, the development of more vaccines, and medical advances against diseases such as malaria. The horrors of World War II also inspired global leaders to build new institutions like the World Health Organization and UNICEF to promote economic development and confront humanitarian crises. In the decades that followed, international agencies, local governments, and foreign-aid donors worked together on successful campaigns to eradicate smallpox, vaccinate millions of children, and increase access in poor nations to lifesaving medicines for tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and other diseases.\nEven in countries with the most rudimentary health systems, the international investment in developing and disseminating medical advances has yielded longer lives, fewer dead children and grief-stricken families, and less human suffering more generally. Yet it has also made many nations more vulnerable to contagious viruses for which there are no available drugs to treat and no vaccines to prevent infections, and against which people have no preexisting immunity.\nSuccessful outbreak control works like this: Patients report their symptoms to health-care workers. Those health-care workers then report unusual cases to local public-health officials who investigate the illness. Those officials may isolate ailing patients, identify others with whom they have come into contact, and monitor those individuals. The results of these investigations are reported to government officials, who communicate reliable information about the outbreak and its causes to the public and the press. That information enables those who are not sick to take measures, such as hand washing and avoiding crowds, to prevent themselves from getting infected and spreading the outbreak. The promise of reliable information and competent, supportive medical care convinces others who are suffering symptoms to come forward so that new cases are identified, tracked, and treated. This cycle continues until the virus stops infecting new people, the people already infected get well or perish, and the outbreak burns out."}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/former_president_first_lady_recovering_from_covid-19/11304905", "title": "Former President , first lady recovering from Covid - 19", "text": "Former President, first lady recovering from Covid-19\nEeva Ahtisaari tested positive for the virus on 21 March, while her husband was diagnosed a few days later.\nFormer President Martti Ahtisaari and his wife Eeva are said to be recovering from Covid-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus.\nOn Tuesday, a statement from the Office of the President indicated that samples from both patients came back negative for the virus and that they were continuing their recovery.\nThe office broke the news that 83-year-old Eeva Ahtisaari was diagnosed with the disease on 21 March and later revealed on 24 March that the former president, 82, also tested positive.\nAhtisaari was Finland's 10th President and held office from 1994 - 2000.

Germany, France and Spain, which had previously reported cases, confirmed new infections in people who were from or had visited northern Italy.\nA 70-year-old man from Switzerland’s southern canton (state) of Ticino, which borders Italy, tested positive after returning from a trip to Milan, the head of the Swiss Federal Office for Public Health said.\nThe man is being isolated at a clinic in Lugano while authorities try to trace anyone he had contact with, Pascal Strupler said. It is the first case in Switzerland, but Strupler said it was likely the country would see more in future.\nCroatia also confirmed its first case Tuesday in a man who had traveled to Milan.\nPrime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said it’s a “younger man, with a mild form of the disease” and that he has “been isolated and his condition is good.”\nAuthorities in the western Austrian state of Tyrol said the country’s first two cases involved a woman and a man, both 24-years-old and from the Bergamo area in Lombardy. They had driven to Austria in their private car on Friday, the same day the coronavirus cases in Italy spiked.\nThe woman fell ill Saturday and developed a fever Sunday, said Guenter Weiss, a senior doctor at Innsbruck’s university hospital. The woman’s boyfriend got a fever and a sore throat Sunday.\nThe couple reported themselves to authorities late Monday. Both are in a stable condition with only mild symptoms but will be kept in isolation until the weekend, said Weiss.\n“We have to work on the assumption that due to the proximity to Italy, one or the other case may still come,” he added.\nFranz Katzgraber, the head of the Tyrol state health department, said authorities are currently tracing possible contacts the patients may have had in Austria. Local daily Tiroler Tageszeitung reported that the woman worked at a hotel in the center of Innsbruck, which was temporarily ordered closed.\nHerbert Kickl of Austria’s opposition far-right Freedom Party immediately called for border crossings to be “reduced to a minimum.”\n“Everything must be done to stop the virus from spreading further in Austria,” said Kickl, who also called for illegal immigrants and asylum-seekers to be put in quarantine.\nBut Italy’s health minister, Roberto Speranza, said late Tuesday after meeting with counterparts from neighboring countries including Austria, Switzerland and Croatia that they had agreed closing borders would be “inappropriate.”\nYet even as European countries tried frantically to coordinate their response, Italy reported a spike in the number of confirmed cases of the virus Tuesday to 322 — 100 more than a day earlier — and four more deaths, bringing the total to 11.\nSperanza said that all the participants in the meeting, who included representatives from Germany, France and tiny San Marino, planned to consult regularly about the situation by conference call.\nFrance announced two new cases of the virus, a young Chinese woman who arrived from China on Feb. 7 and now hospitalized in Paris, and a young French man who had returned from a trip to Lombardy. Jerome Salomon, France’s health services chief, said the young man is hospitalized in the Rhone-Alpes region in southeast France.\nAuthorities in Germany, which early on in the outbreak reported about a dozen cases linked to a traveler from China, said Tuesday that a new infection had been confirmed in the southwest of the country.\nHealth officials in Baden-Wuerttemberg state said the 25-year-old man from the Goeppingen area had likely contracted the virus on a recent visit to Milan.\nThe German Red Cross, meanwhile, said people who have recently traveled to areas with local transmission of the virus, such as parts of northern Italy, will be prevented from giving blood for four weeks.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Frances D’Emilio in Rome and Elaine Ganley in Paris contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/huge-rise-coronavirus-cases-raises-doubts-scale-epidemic-china", "title": "Huge rise in coronavirus cases casts doubt over scale of epidemic", "text": "Huge rise in coronavirus cases casts doubt over scale of epidemic\nChina reports 13,332 additional cases due to a change in how authorities are counting them\n- Coronavirus – live updates\nThe true scale of the epidemic caused by the new coronavirus in Hubei province has been thrown into doubt after the Chinese authorities reported more than 13,300 extra cases going back over an unknown number of days or weeks.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said the huge jump in cases in Hubei, bringing the total to more than 60,000 worldwide, was due to a change in the way Chinese authorities are counting them.\nCases where doctors have seen chest infection on a CT scan are now being classed as coronavirus rather than just those confirmed by a lab test result, leading to a 254 rise in deaths to a total of 1,370 since the outbreak began. All but two of the deaths have been in China.\nIn addition to the 13,332 extra cases, Chinese authorities on Thursday reported a further 1,820 laboratory-confirmed cases.\nThe WHO is now working hard to try to get further details of when the extra cases of what is now being called Covid-19 occurred, to have a true picture of how the epidemic has been developing in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei.\n“Most of these [additional] cases relate to a period going back days or weeks,” said Dr Michael Ryan, the WHO’s head of emergencies. “It is retrospective reporting. It is largely due to how cases are being diagnosed and reported.”\nOn the positive side, it meant Hubei’s doctors would be able to report cases more quickly because they no longer have to wait for lab confirmation, said Ryan.\nThe political fallout from the outbreak also escalated on Thursday with the firing of Hubei’s party chief, the party chief of Wuhan and the head of China’s Hong Kong and Macau affairs office. Ying Yong, the new party chief of Hubei, came up through the ranks in Zhejiang – where President Xi Jinping, previously served as party secretary – and was also part of anti-corruption campaigns, the president’s signature initiative.\n“This is clearly Xi’s move,” said Dali Yang, a professor of political science focusing on China at the University of Chicago. “The stakes are high and he needed time to find the right people for the positions to salvage the Hubei, Wuhan situation.”\nOn Wednesday, the state-run China Daily reported that a powerful Beijing official parachuted into Wuhan to supervise the fight against the virus had reprimanded local officials for failing to organise treatment quickly enough for people reporting to hospitals with symptoms.\nThursday’s jump in infections may have been another impetus for the purges. “I suspect Xi would have wanted the personnel change to project a sense that he is in control of the situation. The bad numbers undermine that message,” said Sam Crane, who teaches Chinese politics and ancient philosophy at Williams College in the US.\nProf Paul Hunter, a coronavirus expert from the University of East Anglia, said cases that in the past would only have been considered suspect would now fall into the confirmed bracket. Many would be Covid-19 cases that would have been confirmed if lab tests had been done, but the figures would also include some people who had pneumonia not caused by the coronavirus.\n“The issue remains how are we going to be able to say what is happening with the trajectory of the outbreak when the cases definitions change midway through the epidemic?” Hunter said. “Will the figures be backdated? Also, what about cases that have a clinical diagnosis but negative lab tests, are they included in the confirmed cases or not?\n“I have no problem with people using different case definitions but please be consistent or if you do change, run both in parallel for a few days so that no one believes the epidemic has suddenly got a lot worse. I suspect but can’t be certain that the underlying trend is still downwards.”\nThe rest of China is only reporting confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection. So are the 24 countries that have declared cases, which so far number 447 outside of China with two deaths – in the Philippines and Japan. “We are not seeing a dramatic increase outside of China,” said Ryan. The largest cluster was the 218 confirmed cases on the Japanese cruise ship Diamond Princess.\nNor, he said, are they seeing any significant shift in the pattern of mortality or severe illness. Those who were severely ill tended to be male and over 40 – and the more severe, the older they are, with the most dangerous cases in the 60s, 70s and 80s, Ryan said.\nHe suggested the best hope in the near future lay in the trials of existing antiviral drugs, which include some that are in use against Aids and HIV. Trials have started in China and it is hoped they will be extended to countries such as Singapore and Japan, both of which have significant numbers of cases. “You can imagine being a frontline clinician at the moment. Knowing which drug works would be a magical gift,” said Ryan.\nThe change in China to include what are known as “probable cases” appeared aimed at heading off complaints about the availability of tests and treatment for residents, as well as questions about whether officials have been underreporting cases.\nThe shortage of the testing kits has meant many sick residents have been unable to seek treatment, with hospital admission contingent on the test result. Health workers have been calling for authorities to broaden the parameters for diagnosing in order to treat more patients. Some have also questioned the reliability of the tests.\nThe crisis has also deepened in Hong Kong, where the education minister announced that schools would remain closed until at least the middle of March. They have been closed since the start of the lunar new year at the end of January.\nIn Vietnam, the authorities announced the lockdown of the commune of Son Loi, a farming region about 25 miles from Hanoi, for 20 days. Checkpoints were set up around the commune and health officials wearing protective suits sprayed disinfectant on vehicles."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/22/coronavirus-asymptomatic-wuhan-woman-shows-why-outbreak-will-be-hard-to-stop", "title": "Coronavirus : asymptomatic Wuhan woman shows why outbreak  will be hard to stop  ", "text": "Coronavirus: asymptomatic Wuhan woman shows why outbreak 'will be hard to stop'\nCase study of 20-year-old who infected relatives despite not showing signs of illness – and testing negative – stokes global pandemic fears\nA 20-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan travelled hundreds of miles to another city where she is believed to have infected five relatives without showing signs of infection, scientists in China have said, offering fresh evidence that the new coronavirus can be spread asymptomatically.\nThe case study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, offered clues about how the coronavirus is spreading, and suggested it might be difficult to stop.\nAccording to the study, by Dr Meiyun Wang of the People’s Hospital of Zhengzhou University and colleagues, the woman travelled 400 miles (650km) from Wuhan to Anyang in Henan province on 10 January and visited several relatives. When they started getting sick, doctors isolated the woman and tested her for coronavirus. Initially, the young woman tested negative for the virus, but a follow-up test was positive.\nAll five of her relatives developed Covid-19 pneumonia, but as of 11 February, the woman had still not developed any symptoms, her chest CT remained normal and she had no fever, stomach or respiratory symptoms, such as cough or sore throat.\nScientists in the study were careful to qualify the conclusions by saying the evidence “suggested” the woman had infected her relatives. But they nevertheless warned that if the findings were replicated, “the prevention of Covid-19 infection could prove challenging”.\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China’s lockdown of millions of people as helping to buy time for the rest of the world to prepare for the new virus.\nBut as hot spots emerge around the globe, such as South Korea and Iran, health officials are having difficulty finding and isolating the first source of the virus – the so-called index case. This is fuelling concern that the disease has begun spreading too widely for tried-and-true public health steps to stamp it out.\n“A number of spot fires occurring around the world is a sign that things are ticking along, and what we are going to have here is probably a pandemic,” said Ian Mackay, who studies viruses at the University of Queensland in Australia.\nThe WHO has insisted that Covid-19 is not yet a pandemic and says countries outside China do not yet need more draconian measures. But the spike in cases outside China means the world could be running out of time.\n“What we see is a very different phase of this outbreak depending where you look,” said WHO’s Dr Sylvie Briand. “We see different patterns of transmission in different places.”\nThe WHO defines a global pandemic as a disease spreading on two continents, though some public health experts would call an outbreak a pandemic if the spread is over a wide area or across many international borders.\nDr William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University medical centre in Nashville, who was not involved in the Zhengzhou University study, said the Wuhan woman’s case provided a “natural laboratory” to study Covid-19.\n“Scientists have been asking if you can have this infection and not be ill? The answer is apparently, yes,” he said.\n“You had this patient from Wuhan where the virus is, traveling to where the virus wasn’t. She remained asymptomatic and infected a bunch of family members and you had a group of physicians who immediately seized on the moment and tested everyone.”\nKey questions now, Schaffner said, are how often does this kind of transmission occur and when during the asymptomatic period does a person test positive for the virus.\nReuters and Associated Press contributed to this article."}, {"url": "https://news.err.ee/1085124/samost-and-sildam-estonia-and-neighbors-could-have-common-quarantine-area", "title": "Samost and Sildam : Estonia and neighbors could have common quarantine area", "text": "Samost and Sildam: Estonia and neighbors could have common quarantine area ({{contentCtrl.commentsTotal}})\nBecause the tourism and service sectors have been hit the hardest in the coronavirus crisis, the government should consider targeted measures and discuss creating a common quarantine area with neighboring countries, journalists Anvar Samost and Toomas Sildam found on Vikerraadio.\nToomas Sildam said that Saaremaa entrepreneurs' hopes for a bright and financially lucrative summer have been dashed as Saaremaa will continue to be a question mark for mainlanders even after restrictions on movement are lifted. \"Which is only natural as Saaremaa has been made out to be the corona island,\" Sildam said.\nSamost said that perhaps targeted crisis measures would be in order. \"It has been discussed in Finland whether to create special vouchers people could cash with various companies on the taxpayer's dime. It is a separate matter to which extent that would be justified in Estonia. But something like that could be considered,\" he said.\nSildam said it would be natural for Enterprise Estonia or other agents to promote discovering and vacationing in Estonia this summer. Samost added that Estonians are unlikely to have much choice in the matter anyway.\n\"The question is whether countries in the same region as Estonia should create a common quarantine area. Restrictions laid down by Finland are especially draconian toward Estonia as the country depends on the millions of Finnish tourists who have upheld the Estonian tourism sector that makes up roughly 10 percent of GDP,\" he said.\nSildam agreed that Estonia should maintain high readiness for regional cooperation should another similar crisis hit. \"So that the Baltics and Finland could make decisions and lay down restrictions in a coordinated fashion.\"\nAnvar Samost said that Estonia is not the only one benefiting from passenger traffic in the Gulf of Finland. Finland is equally invested in the movement of Estonians. \"Tourism is not a one-way street. It also works to support the Finnish economy. It is to be hoped the Finnish government takes it seriously and will be able to make more coherent decisions than the mess we've seen since mid-April as concerns cross-border traffic to and from Estonia and Sweden,\" he said.\nSamost gave the example of labor migration on the border between Estonia and Latvia where no great confusion has arisen. \"Cooperation between Estonia and Latvia has been very successful in terms of communing and has not seen any major disruption as far as I am aware.

The data covered by the CDC is subject to change as more information becomes available.\n- The highest hospitalization rates in the U.S. are currently for those 65 years and older followed by those between 50 and 64 years old.\n- The national percentage of respiratory specimen testing positive for COVID-19 is 16.5% at public health labs and 8.8.% at clinical labs, the CDC reports. Commercial labs are not included in that roundup.\nBe smart: Deaths recorded by the CDC's national system rely on completed death certificates, which can take anywhere from 1 to 8 weeks to be fully processed and included in the data set, the agency says.\n- But, the data breaks down COVID-19 deaths by age range — a helpful measure of what demographics are impacted.\n- The CDC has recorded the most coronavirus deaths in those 85 years and older, and Americans between 55 to 85 years old are still facing higher fatality rates than younger Americans.\nWhat's next: The CDC will begin releasing weekly summaries of the data, alongside statistics on outpatient visits, ER visits and how many specimens of the virus have been tested to date.\nGo deeper...

I told him that most people his age did OK, while trying not to convey a false sense of security. He told me that another member of his family was sick with the coronavirus, and we spoke of his hometown in South America.\nThe next day his condition had worsened, and our communication was limited to his writing on paper and mouthing words around the tube extending from his windpipe to a ventilator.\nI am an emergency medicine doctor at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens. The Elmhurst neighborhood has been called the “epicenter of the epicenter” of coronavirus infections in the United States. Over the past seven years I have developed a deep affection for Elmhurst and its surrounding neighborhoods. It pains me to watch this community decimated by Covid-19.\nQueens represents what the world imagines New York City to be, a cultural melting pot where grit and ambition can still get you ahead. Walking to work I pass women selling tamales from grocery carts, the smell of strong Colombian coffee, the sounds of bachata and bhangra music emanating from storefronts.\nNow in our emergency department, the mildly ill Covid patients lie on crowded rows of stretchers or sit on hard plastic chairs attached to supplemental oxygen to keep their blood oxygen levels from plummeting. They wait endlessly for an available inpatient bed or to be transferred to a less crowded hospital. An ever increasing number of critically ill patients lie next to hissing and beeping ventilators, either intubated and sedated or with uncomfortable CPAP masks strapped to their faces.\nWith the masks on the patient, the personal protective equipment on the doctor and the ceaseless noises of critical care, it is not easy to communicate — especially when patients are as likely to speak Bengali or Fuzhounese as English.\nWhile our hospital staff and the broader medical community scramble to bolster our resources and respond to the pandemic, we should pause to consider why it has so heavily hit Elmhurst, and Queens at large.\nThe people living around Elmhurst Hospital are both vulnerable and neglected: largely immigrants, poor, uninsured and dependent on a public hospital system that is already overstretched and underfunded. Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and Corona are the neighborhoods with the highest percentage of foreign-born residents in New York City, coming from seemingly every corner of the world.\nThese people work jobs that we now acknowledge to be essential — driving cabs, stocking grocery stores, making and delivering food. Many are undocumented immigrants and work off the books or as a part of the gig economy; their jobs don’t offer health insurance, benefits or employment protection. One in five people living in Corona and Elmhurst lives in poverty. Some who are sick or medically at high risk of becoming sick have continued to work because they can’t afford to lose wages or their jobs. These are the circumstances of the often invisible work force that continues to keep New York running now, in skeletal form.\nThe luxury of working from home is not an option for our patients. Commuting to work on the 7 train for a night shift, I still see plenty of workers returning from their jobs in Manhattan, using the cheapest form of transportation available to them. Our patients cannot shelter in second homes or purchase private ventilators. An entirely different part of the health care system serves that slice of society.\nRather, our patients ask how they can avoid spreading the virus to their older parents or young children in their small apartments. I have no good answer. The neighborhood has among the highest rates of severely crowded housing in the city. Landlords convert single-family homes into cramped, poorly ventilated apartment units. Years ago, an ambulance brought to our hospital two unconscious girls and a man almost unrecognizable from his burns — the victims of a house fire in a subdivided building. An additional victim was not discovered until the next day, dead in the attic where he had been living. Such living conditions leave little room for social distancing.\nNew York City’s public hospital system serves more than a million New Yorkers each year, regardless of their ability to pay. Beyond the undocumented and uninsured, Elmhurst Hospital serves other vulnerable populations neglected by the private medical system: prisoners, the homeless, the drug-addicted and the mentally ill. Public hospitals are where the police bring those too mentally ill and violent for the shelter system, where desperate families bring demented older relatives whom they can no longer properly care for.\nNot infrequently, patients come to me with notes from medical professionals at other hospitals who told them to come to us for an essential but nonemergency procedure. Ostensibly, these referring hospitals also receive tax exemptions and nonprofit status for the indigent care they provide, but in the profit-driven, competitive landscape of New York City hospitals, the public system picks up the slack in caring for the vulnerable.\nQueens has 1.5 hospital beds per 1,000 people, compared to 5.3 in Manhattan. Typically serving what the health care industry calls an “unfavorable payer mix” and as a result dependent on government funding, public hospitals often lack the resources of the parallel nonpublic hospital system in New York City.\nEven during normal times, patients at Elmhurst Hospital experience long waits for mundane medical concerns, which is indicative of their lack of access to more reliable primary care. Inpatient hospital beds are often full, as are the intensive care units. And so it is wholly unsurprising that this hospital would be overwhelmed now by an enormous surge of patients.\nPresident Trump has expressed a hollow-sounding allegiance with the plight of this community, claiming to have “grown up” in the neighborhood, a surprising acknowledgment given his antipathy to immigrants. The president’s neglect of his hometown is as disappointing as the broad incompetence of his administration’s Covid response. The peak of the Covid pandemic is still ahead of us, but one day it will pass, and when that happens, I hope we remember the social failures that enabled Covid to so extensively affect communities like Elmhurst.\nBen McVane is an emergency medicine doctor at Elmhurst Hospital Center.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/corona-restrictions-limit-freight-shipments/av-52802942", "title": "Corona restrictions limit freight shipments | Business| Economy and finance news from a German perspective | DW", "text": "Corona travel restrictions are not just affecting passenger travel -- but freight travel as well.

The candidates have swapped crowded halls for Zoom conference calls. Supporters conduct their debates in virtual chat rooms rather than crowded pubs. The new leader will be announced in a round-robin email rather than, as had been planned, at a Westminster rally with full razzmatazz.\nThe email will be sent on April 4th, after The Economist goes to press, but, barring an earthquake, the new leader will be Sir Keir Starmer, the party’s Brexit spokesman. Sir Keir has led by a country mile in every stage of the contest from nominations by MPs to support from trade unions and local constituencies. Most opinion polls have pointed to a decisive victory. The winner of the (separately elected) deputy leadership is likely to be Angela Rayner, who is currently self-isolating with symptoms of the coronavirus.\nSir Keir, if indeed it is him, will enjoy two substantial advantages from the get-go. The first, and most important, is that he’s not Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Corbyn has been the party’s most disastrous leader ever—not just useless like George Lansbury and Michael Foot, who led the party to electoral disaster in 1935 and 1983 respectively, but positively malign. His failure to throw his party’s weight behind the Remain campaign contributed significantly to Britain’s decision to leave the EU, which most of the membership opposed. His refusal to meet Theresa May half-way during the dying days of her administration killed off any chance of a soft Brexit. His extreme politics and sanctimonious style drove traditional Labour voters into Boris Johnson’s arms.\nThe second is that the Labour Party is tired of failing. The less-awful-than-expected defeat of 2017 persuaded the faithful that what they needed was more effort rather than fresh thought. The catastrophic failure of 2019 dispelled that illusion and reconciled all but fanatics to the idea that politics is the art of the possible. Sir Keir’s sustained lead means that he has been able to avoid making pledges to various factions and will take over with a blank sheet of paper and a powerful mandate.\nThere’s a widespread view that the epidemic has provided Sir Keir with a third advantage: a political environment that is shifting sharply leftward. The government’s decision to pump money into the economy and nationalise key industries is not only demonstrating the vital importance of the state in coping with a disaster, the argument goes. It is moving the boundaries of what is politically acceptable. How can the Tories make fun of “magic money trees” when they have discovered a forest of them? How can they argue against “picking winners” when they are choosing companies to make ventilators? Mr Corbyn says that the government’s response to covid-19 proves that he was “absolutely right” to call for higher public spending. Some prominent Labour politicians, such as Ian Lavery and Rebecca Long-Bailey, have been overheard arguing that the crisis contains opportunities for the left. Such views are echoed outside the party: several Cabinet ministers have expressed concern that they won the election only to find themselves implementing Labour’s policies.\nThe sense that the wind is blowing leftwards is not confined to Britain. “The corona crisis is not without its advantages,” says Ulrike Herrmann, a German anti-capitalist. Thinkers such as Thomas Piketty, Naomi Klein and Grace Blakeley are hanging all their favourite policies on covid-19 like baubles on a Christmas tree: a radical redistribution of wealth here, a green new deal there and, posed on top, the angelic vision of a universal basic income.\nYet the notion that covid-19 is the herald of a socialist nirvana is not entirely convincing. True, massive external shocks such as the current pandemic can certainly shake-up political allegiances, particularly when they are as weak as they are at the moment. And in some ways, the left is having a good crisis: institutions to which it is wedded, such as the BBC and the National Health Service, are more admired than ever. Right-wing blowhards such as Donald Trump are more reviled, in Britain at least.\nBut the current expansion of the state does not represent a philosophical conversion to the case for revolution. It is a pragmatic response to a unique set of problems: a combination of Keynesian demand management to boost the economy, time-limited intervention to prevent industries from collapsing and a basic income for workers who are temporarily laid off. This debt-fuelled expansion will certainly lead to higher taxes in the long term but it will also put a constraint on the state’s future ambitions.\nTalk about a new settlement comparable with that under Labour in 1945 is particularly far-fetched. Scientists are confident that they will find a cure for the virus eventually, perhaps within a year. When that blessed day comes, voters will desire nothing so much as a “return to normalcy”, just as they did in the 1920s after the first world war and the Spanish flu. They will see the covid era not as a time of ideological renewal but as a temporary crisis that involved a weird combination of admirable collectivism and irritating restrictions on personal freedom.\nDo not adjust your belief set\nThe job of leading the opposition during a national crisis is arguably the worst in the world. Britons are rallying around the government: one poll shows the Conservatives leading Labour by 28 points and 72% of voters saying that they are satisfied with Mr Johnson’s performance as prime minister. Sir Keir’s best chance of success lies in playing to his strengths as a post-ideological pragmatist. In public he should ask practical questions about the government’s performance in producing ventilators and covid tests or getting economic help to the vulnerable, while avoiding the impression that he’s sniping. Behind the scenes he should prepare for normal times by clearing out Mr Corbyn’s most scrofulous followers. If he bets on a new era of big-government socialism, he will waste his political capital. ■\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus tracker and story hub\nThis article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline \"The return of the opposition\""}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-can-take-the-economic-edge-off-covid-19-11583940758", "title": "Congress Can Take the Economic Edge off Covid - 19", "text": "- Opinion\n- Commentary\nCongress Can Take the Economic Edge off Covid-19\nGive cash assistance to low-income Americans so they don’t feel compelled to go to work sick.\nCovid-19 will soon be an epidemic in the U.S. Large cities need to take emergency measures to protect their residents, especially those who are at greatest risk for hospitalization or death.

These days they are positively Swabian, saving a much bigger share of their post-tax incomes than they have done for most of the past three decades (see chart). This is more than just an economic curiosity. Many households’ savings end up in Treasury bonds, reducing the government’s borrowing costs. Savings allow households to consume more later or to cushion the blow of a misfortune. But why is their propensity to save so high today?\nSaving typically rises during the bad times and falls during the good. The financial crisis of 2007-09 prompted Americans to pull back on spending and pay down debts. The share of disposable income squirrelled away rose from 3% in 2005 to 8% in 2010-12. These days the economy is much stronger. The unemployment rate, at 3.6%, is at a five-decade low, while consumer confidence is high. As other countries have recovered from the crisis, their personal-saving rates have tumbled. But America’s remains high, and has risen in recent years. Goldman Sachs, a bank, says that the personal-saving rate is four percentage points higher than it “should” be, given the strength of the economy.\nOne commonly heard explanation for higher saving relates to inequality. Poorer people may save little or nothing—research from the Federal Reserve suggests that 12% of adults would be unable to cover a $400 emergency expense. Rich people, by contrast, tend to save a big share of their income. A body of evidence suggests that in recent years the rich have taken a greater share of total income, thereby dragging the overall personal-saving rate upwards. Still, rising inequality is at best an incomplete explanation for America’s savings puzzle. As the chart shows, saving was far higher in the 1970s, yet inequality was lower.\nThe financial system may play a more important role. In recent years many Americans have found it more difficult to access credit. From 2008 banks tightened lending standards on consumer and credit-card loans. The median credit score for both mortgages and car loans is higher than it was before the crisis. It is now more difficult for middle-income households to spend beyond their means.\nAnother possible factor is that, despite a strong economy, households remain deeply uncertain about the future. There is good evidence that Americans are worried about the threat to their jobs from automation and import competition. The on- and off-again trade war may be another source of anxiety. A widely watched measure of economic uncertainty, based on analysis of newspaper articles, last year hit an all-time high—and it may rise further if the covid-19 outbreak worsens. All this encourages prudent behaviour. According to the Fed, the share of people saying that “liquidity” (in plain English, having rainy-day money) is the most important reason for saving has been rising since the mid-2000s. Americans could be stashing the cash for some time yet. ■\nThis article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline \"Land of the frugal\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/opinion/coronavirus-lockdown.html", "title": "Opinion | America Shouldnt Have to Play by New York Rules", "text": "In 1976, the artist Saul Steinberg drew a cover for The New Yorker — “View of the World from Ninth Avenue” — that became an instant classic. You know the one: Manhattan heavily in the foreground, the Hudson River, a brownish strip called “Jersey,” the rest of the America vaguely in the distance.\nIt could almost be a map of the coronavirus epidemic in the United States.\nEven now, it is stunning to contemplate the extent to which the country’s Covid-19 crisis is a New York crisis — by which I mean the city itself along with its wider metropolitan area.\nAs of Friday, there have been more Covid-19 fatalities on Long Island’s Nassau County (population 1.4 million) than in all of California (population 40 million). There have been more fatalities in Westchester County (989) than in Texas (611). The number of Covid deaths per 100,000 residents in New York City (132) is more than 16 times what it is in America’s next largest city, Los Angeles (8). If New York City proper were a state, it would have suffered more fatalities than 41 other states combined.\nIt isn’t hard to guess why. New York has, by far, the highest population density in the U.S. among cities of 100,000 or more. Commuters crowd trains, office workers crowd elevators, diners crowd restaurants. No other American city has the same kind of jammed pedestrian life as New York — Times Square alone gets 40 million visitors a year — or as many residents packed into high-rises. The city even has a neighborhood called Corona, which, it turns out, has among the highest rates of coronavirus infections.\nConsider a thought experiment in which metropolitan New York weren’t just its own state, but its own country. What would the crisis for what remained of America look like, then? In this slightly smaller nation of a little more than 300 million people, the death toll would amount to about 7.5 per 100,000, slightly above Germany’s levels.\nNo wonder so much of America has dwindling sympathy with the idea of prolonging lockdown conditions much further. The curves are flattening; hospital systems haven’t come close to being overwhelmed; Americans have adapted to new etiquettes of social distancing. Many of the worst Covid outbreaks outside New York (such as at Chicago’s Cook County Jail or the Smithfield Foods processing plant in Sioux Falls, S.D.) have specific causes that can be addressed without population-wide lockdowns.\nYet Americans are being told they must still play by New York rules — with all the hardships they entail — despite having neither New York’s living conditions nor New York’s health outcomes. This is bad medicine, misguided public policy, and horrible politics.\nOn Friday, I spoke with Tomislav Mihaljevic, C.E.O. of the widely admired Cleveland Clinic, and an advocate of the need to use “tailored and discriminating solutions” that also recognize regional differences. At the moment, he says, “We’re using the methodology from the 14th century to combat the biggest pandemic of the 21st century.” It can’t go on.\nDr. Mihaljevic acknowledges the necessity of the lockdowns to contain the virus, along with the urgent need for ramped-up testing and ongoing monitoring. But, he adds, “we cannot hold our breath forever.” The U.S. will not soon be able to test 330 million people. Effective therapies or vaccines may be long in coming. Covid-19 will be “a disease we have to learn to live with.”\nThat means accepting that the immediate goal of public policy cannot be to eliminate the risk of Covid-19. It is to mitigate, manage and frame expectations for it — while not losing sight of other priorities. In Ohio Dr. Mihaljevic says that Covid patients take up just 2 percent of hospital capacity, and the curve of new infections has been flat for more than two weeks. Yet there has been a dramatic decline in people seeking care for heart attacks, strokes, or new cancers, presumably out of fear of going to hospital.\n“The public conversation needs to be about the value of human life in its totality,” Dr. Mihaljevic says. That includes fewer restrictions on activity for people at the low end of the risk spectrum, while taking additional care of those on the high end.\nRight now, there’s a lot of commentary coming from talking heads (many of them in New York) about the danger of lifting lockdowns in places like Tennessee. Perhaps the commentary needs to move in the opposite direction. Tennesseeans are within their rights to return to a semblance of normal life while demanding longer restrictions on New Yorkers.\nI write this from New York, so it’s an argument against my personal interest. But I don’t see why people living in a Nashville suburb should not be allowed to return to their jobs because people like me choose to live, travel and work in urban sardine cans.\nGina Raimondo, the Rhode Island governor, was on to something when, a few weeks ago, she wanted to quarantine drivers arriving from New York.

Here's a snapshot of some of the highlights.\nAs with the rest of the globe, the news this week was dominated by one thing and one thing alone, the coronavirus pandemic. While the number of cases last weekend stood at 10, by Friday this had quadrupled, to 41, President Kersti Kaljulaid was unable to attend the 30th anniversary of the foundation of the Estonian Congress having been to an event in Washington attended by a COVID-19 carrier, and the Estonian government had declared a situation of emergency, together with a package of measures aimed at countering the spread.\nThere were a few other things happening too, however. The 1944 bombing of Tallinn was commemorated, as it is every year, and Estonia had the honor of being the first country to be asked to take part in an expansion of French operations in Mali.\nCoronavirus stories\n- Estonian government declares emergency situation against coronavirus.\n- Social affairs minister: 41 confirmed coronavirus cases in Estonia.\n- Opinion: Government behaving responsibly over coronavirus.\n- AirBaltic cancels all Milan and Verona flights until end of April.\n- Coronavirus: What you need to know.\n- Ratas attends European Union leaders meeting by video conference.\nIn other news...\n- 2019 Press Photos of the Year revealed.\n- Kaljulaid: A few bad decisions all that is needed to lose freedom.\n- Gallery: Bryan Adams' 'Exposed' exhibition opens at Tallinn's Fotografiska.\n- Daily Õhtuleht restricts online commenting to subscribers-only.\n- Gallery: 1944 bombing of Tallinn commemorated.\n- Registered unemployment grows to 5.7 percent in February.\n- Gallery: Military Police training drug, bomb and weapons dogs.\n- Estonia first nation invited by France to join Mali operations expansion.\nDownload the ERR News app for Android and iOS now and never miss an update!\nEditor: Andrew Whyte"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/china/2020/02/22/in-china-newly-confirmed-cases-of-coronavirus-infection-are-falling", "title": "Casualties of war - In China , newly confirmed cases of coronavirus infection are falling | China", "text": "CHINESE OFFICIALS call it “waging war on two fronts”. One involves battling the coronavirus that has infected more than 74,000 people in China and killed about 2,100 since it was discovered in the central city of Wuhan in December. The other is a struggle to revive the economy. The daily number of newly diagnosed infections has mostly fallen since February 13th. But a month after imposing the most extensive quarantine measures ever enforced during an epidemic, most local governments are hesitant to ease up.\nSome coastal cities have made it easier for businesses to obtain approval before resuming work and have eased requirements for returning workers to provide proof of their health. But controls remain harsh. Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, is still under the tightest lockdown. Since late January it has been all but sealed off from the rest of the country. Until mid-February residents of Wuhan—a city more populous than London—had at least been allowed to stroll in the streets. But lately the authorities have stepped up the “wartime measures” that officials have put in place to fight the spread of covid-19, as the disease caused by the virus is known.\nFirst, local officials began stopping people from leaving their homes more than once every two days. Then the government banned all non-urgent excursions, even for buying necessities. Local officials help to arrange the delivery of essentials to each home. One resident of Wuhan says that in his district, households must choose their food supplies from a short list of slightly differing parcels.\nMany less-affected cities outside Hubei are also regulating their citizens’ comings and goings. In Zhengzhou, the capital of neighbouring Henan province, officials have issued households with exit passes to be shown at checkpoints at the entrances to their housing complexes. This is supposed to prevent non-essential outings. Similar restrictions are in place in several other big cities, including in the far-western region of Xinjiang. The New York Times calculates that, by February 18th, epidemic-related limits on outdoor movement were affecting about 150m people nationwide.\nIn the biggest cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, controls are not as strict. But since people began returning from their extended lunar new-year holidays checkpoints have been set up in neighbourhoods to prevent access by non-residents (how strictly rules are applied varies according to the enthusiasm of whoever is on duty). On February 14th Beijing’s city government said that people who enter the capital from any other province will have to self-quarantine for two weeks, Beijingers included.\nThe longer such measures linger, the harder it will be for officials fighting on the economic front. Wuhan is an industrial centre and Hubei’s GDP is bigger than Poland’s. In an internal speech on February 3rd, made public 12 days later, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, said the country’s original economic targets for the year “must be fulfilled”. This is an ambitious goal. Many of China’s firms have been crippled by tight quarantine measures and have yet to resume normal business despite a supposed return to work on February 10th in most areas. Businesses in Hubei had been scheduled to reopen on February 21st. The date has been pushed back to March 10th.\nFor some people, the restrictions are a nightmare. Even in lightly affected regions, hospitals remain closed to all but the most urgent cases (a mother in Hubei is pictured, pleading with police to allow her daughter through a cordon to get cancer treatment). Some people in Hubei find it difficult even to travel to pharmacies to pick up essential medicine. A charity worker says he calls up local officials to alert them to the needs of disabled residents. But the bureaucrats are often flustered by the calls, he says, because they are so overworked.\nMany Chinese say they are afraid of catching covid-19 and that the government’s measures are a necessary price to pay for the protection of their health. But there are also many who believe the authorities’ response to the epidemic was bungled, especially in the days leading up to the lockdown in Hubei when officials were slow to acknowledge the virus’s threat. The Communist Party worries that public anger could threaten social stability (the need to maintain it was a big theme of Mr Xi’s recently published speech). Censors have been struggling to control online criticisms, which surged earlier this month following the death from covid-19 of a doctor who had been reprimanded by police for warning of the danger. Access has been throttled to foreign virtual private networks, which some people in China use to circumvent the “great firewall”.\nMr Xi is also waging war on another front: against overseas critics (see article). On February 19th China ordered three of the Wall Street Journal’s China-based reporters to leave the country. It is the largest expulsion of accredited foreign journalists in China in decades. Officials say it is in response to an opinion piece entitled: “China is the real sick man of Asia”. That headline caused widespread offence, for it repeats a slur used by western and Japanese imperialists about China. The Journal says it did not realise this, and that its words were a play on an old cliché used of the Ottoman Empire and commonly revived in headlines about various countries. The Economist, the Guardian and the Financial Times have all called Britain “the sick man of Europe”, notes the Journal.\nMr Xi will probably not have to worry about embarrassing questions at the annual session of China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress. It is due to start in early March, but senior delegates will meet on February 24th to discuss whether to postpone it. They are expected to do so. China’s leaders will not want to send the wrong message by convening the congress at a time when many Chinese are effectively confined to their homes and when officials (which many of the nearly 3,000 delegates are) should be on the front lines, fighting the epidemic.\nBut the publication of Mr Xi’s speech could be a sign that he is confident of victory. It revealed that he was giving orders on containing the virus as early as January 7th, two weeks before what had hitherto been his earliest-known comments on the outbreak. By letting this be known, the party may want to show that if there was any coverup at that early stage, it was the fault of local officials, not his. The outlines are becoming visible of the party’s strategy when the war is eventually over. ■\nRead more of our coverage of the covid-19 outbreak:\nExperts predict that covid-19 will spread more widely (February 22nd)\nCovid-19 presents economic policymakers with a new sort of threat (February 20th)\nHow China’s coronavirus epidemic could hurt the world economy (February 13th)\nThis article appeared in the China section of the print edition under the headline \"Casualties of war\""}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/6f3367302dff66b9bfb335830b5ed74d", "title": "North Korea ends quarantine of some foreigners in virus move", "text": "Virus cases top 100,000 in 90 countries as markets take dive\nPARIS (AP) — Crossing more borders, the new coronavirus hit a milestone, infecting more than 100,000 people worldwide as it wove itself deeper into the daily lives of millions, infecting the powerful, the unprotected poor and vast masses in between.\nThe virus, which has killed more than 3,400 people and emerged in more than 90 countries, edged into more U.S. states on Friday and even breached the halls of the Vatican. It forced mosques in Iran and beyond to halt weekly Muslim prayers, blocked pilgrims from Jesus’ birthplace in Bethlehem and upended Japan’s plans for the Olympic torch parade.\nAs financial markets dived again, repercussions from the virus also rattled livelihoods in the real economy.\n“Who is going to feed their families?” asked Elias al-Arja, head of a hotel owners’ union in Bethlehem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where tourists have been banned and the storied Church of the Nativity was shuttered.\nAt the White House, President Donald Trump signed a $8.3 billion bill to fight the coronavirus a day after Italy said it would double its own spending to 7.5 billion euros ($8.5 billion).\nIn Geneva, the U.N. health agency said it had received applications for 40 possible virus tests, had 20 vaccine candidates in development and reported that numerous clinical trials of experimental drugs for the new coronavirus were under way.\n“We’re all in this together. We all have a role to play,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, chief of the World Health Organization, urging more global cooperation from the business world and solidarity with the poorest.\nThe news wasn’t all bad: more than half of those who contracted the virus have now recovered. It’s retreating in China, where it first emerged, and in nearby South Korea.\nChina on Saturday morning reported just 99 new cases, the first time it has had only a double digit increase since Jan. 20. It also reported another 28 deaths. Overall, China now counts 22,177 patients currently in treatment, while it has released 55,404. South Korea on Saturday morning reported 174 new cases.\nThe virus continued popping up in new places, however, with countries like Colombia and Togo reporting their first confirmed cases.\nQuestions swirled around whether Iran could control its outbreak, as the number of reported infections jumped beyond 4,700 on Friday, with 124 deaths. Iran set up checkpoints to limit travel and had firefighters spray disinfectant on an 18-kilometer (11-mile) stretch of Tehran’s most famous avenue.\n“It would be great if they did it every day,” grocery store owner Reza Razaienejad said. “It should not be just a one-time thing.”\nThe 100,000 figure of global infections is largely symbolic, but dwarfs other major outbreaks in recent decades, such as SARS, MERS and Ebola. The virus is still much less widespread than annual flu epidemics, which result in up to 5 million annual severe cases around the world and from 290,000 to 650,000 deaths annually, according to WHO.\nBut the epidemic’s economic impact snowballed, with world stocks and the price of oil dropping sharply again Friday.\nThe travel decline and a broader economic downturn linked to the outbreak threatened to hit already-struggling communities for months. In response to plummeting demand, German airline Lufthansa announced a reduction of its capacity in coming weeks to as much as 50% of pre-coronavirus outbreak levels. Slovakia banned all flights to and from Italy.\nThe head of the U.N.’s food agency, the World Food Program, warned of potential for “absolute devastation” as the outbreak’s effects ripple through Africa and the Middle East. India scrambled to stave off an epidemic that could overwhelm its under-funded, under-staffed health care system, which lacks enough labs or hospitals for its 1.3 billion people.\n“We’re seeing more countries affected with lower incomes, with weaker health systems and that’s more concerning,” WHO chief Ghebreyesus said.\nInconsistent health insurance and sick leave policies put the earnings of millions of workers’ who can’t work from home — waiters, drivers, delivery workers and more — at risk. In the U.S. the AFL-CIO labor federation urged the government to issue emergency regulations outlining employers’ responsibilities to protect workers from infectious diseases.\nThe fear and the crackdowns that swept through China are now shifting westward, as workers in Europe and the U.S. stay home, authorities vigorously sanitize public places and consumers flock to stores for household staples.\nNation after nation put some travel restrictions into place, blocking visitors from hard-hit areas like China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. The United Nations’ top climate change official said her agency won’t hold any physical meetings at its headquarters in Germany or elsewhere until the end of April.\nFrench Health Minister Olivier Veran said children would be banned from visiting patients in hospitals and other health facilities across the country and that patients would be limited to one adult visit at a time. Spanish officials announced a month-long closure of 200 centers in and around Madrid where the elderly go for daytime care and activities.\n“The Western world is now following some of China’s playbook,” Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at the financial firm IG, said of the reaction to flu-like illness that for most people causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough but can hit elderly or sick people much harder.\nOff California’s coast, a Grand Princess cruise ship remained at sea with passengers confined to their cabins as Vice President Mike Pence said 21 people on the ship — almost all crew members — had tested positive for coronavirus. Pence said the government was planning to bring the Grand Princess cruise ship into a “non-commercial port” where all the passengers and crew will be tested.\nThailand on Friday blocked a separate cruise ship from docking, worried because it carried dozens of passengers from Italy, which with 197 virus deaths is the center of Europe’s epidemic.\nIn the U.S. the number of cases surpassed 230, scattered across 18 states. The University of Washington announced Friday it would stop holding classes and teach students online, a decision affecting some 57,000 students. The state has at least 70 confirmed COVID-19 cases, most in the Seattle area and the highest U.S. state death toll at 13.\nAs the numbers kept growing in Europe, Serbia threatened to deploy the army to keep the virus at bay, and Hungary used virus fears to tighten its doors against migrants.\nIn Switzlerand, officials reported 210 new virus cases on Friday, up from 90 a day earlier, and the military was being readied to provide support services at hospitals.\n“This wave will come, it will rise, but it will be over at some point,” said Daniel Koch, head of the department for communicable diseases at the country’s Federal Office of Health.\nThe Netherlands reported its first virus death Friday while Serbia, Slovakia, Peru and Cameroon announced their first infections. Even Vatican City was hit, with the tiny city-state confirming its first case Friday. The Vatican has insisted that 83-year-old Pope Francis, who has been sick, only has a cold.\nWHO officials warned against having “false hopes” that the virus could fade away when warmer summer temperatures come to northern countries.\n“Every day we slow down the epidemic is another day governments can prepare their health workers to detect, test, treat and care for patients,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.\n___\nSedensky reported from Bangkok.

All the companies cited concerns for the safety of both staff and visitors.\nHoffman stated that although GSMA had considered a scaled-down event, the plan was discarded after all the buyers had indicated they would not attend the fair.\nThe idea of postponing the showcase was rejected as well, as it was “impossible to predict when this situation is going to conclude”, explained the chief executive.\nDr Mike Ryan, the World Health Organisation’s emergencies chief, said before the cancellation that the show could have gone on.\nHe stated that while no mass gathering is ever risk-free - with the potential for food poisoning, injuries or building collapse - most events “can continue if the proper measures can be applied”.\nSpanish labour unions said the show was called off due to the panic of the major technology companies. The Workers' Commissions (CCOO) union’s regional leader, Javier Pacheco, denounced “the alarmist attitude of the technology companies that from their position of global supremacy don’t care about the local impact.”\nBut Tim Bajarin, president of consultancy Creative Strategies, said the cancellation was prudent with all the unknowns surrounding how the new virus is spread and the fact that many companies had already pulled out.\nThe organising body said on Thursday it does not know yet the cost of cancelling the tech show. Mats Granryd, director-general of the GSMA, pointed out it was too early to discuss the economic impact of the cancellation.\nThe annual tech extravaganza was expected to draw more than 100,000 visitors from about 200 countries, including 5,000 to 6,000 from China.\nThe show normally represents a huge source of revenue for hotels, restaurants and taxi companies, and was to generate 473 million euros and more than 14,000 part-time jobs for the local economy.\nSpain’s vice president, Carmen Calvo, said there was “no public health reason” to call off the show.

One of them lost a family member because of the virus. Their arrival prompted fears among local residents in the midst of the rapidly spreading outbreak. They had to be repeatedly tested before concerns about their condition abated.\nIt hasn’t been easy for the nearly 50 members of the Wuhan Zall team, but on Sunday they will get some reprieve from their ordeal by attending the Spanish league clásico between Real Madrid and Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. The team will also tour the famed venue in Madrid on Monday.\nIts really a well-deserved reward for them, José González, the team’s Spanish coach, told the Associated Press in a telephone interview. It will be an experience that without a doubt they will never forget. They have been training and training day after day, distracted by the situation back home, so it will be a nice break for them to watch a game like this between Real Madrid and Barcelona.\nThe team will be at the Bernabéu on an invitation from Real Madrid and La Liga, which has a partnership with the Chinese Super League, the country’s main soccer competition. The league has been suspended because of the coronavirus and is not expected to resume until mid-April. Wuhan Zall was originally scheduled to stay in its preseason base in southern Spain until mid-February, just before the leagues planned start. Now it is expected to remain in the country at least until the end of March.\nOther Chinese clubs are in a similar situation in countries like Thailand, Japan and the United Arab Emirates, though Wuhan Zall is actually based in the city at the centre of the outbreak that has killed more than 2,800 people worldwide, most of them in China.\nWuhan Zall arrived in Spain at the end of January but previously practiced in the Chinese city of Guanghzou, nearly 1,000 621 miles away from Wuhan. Although the team was far from the initial outbreak, Spanish health authorities had to come out publicly to say there was no reason for local citizens to be concerned about the squads arrival. Three players arrived from China later and had to stay in quarantine and be tested for the virus before joining the rest of the group.\nThe fear of the unknown obviously always exists, González said. I understood those who were reticent about the team coming to Spain. But with time it became clear that there was no problem with the team being here.\nGonzález, a former striker who had played in China, said his focus has been to take the players minds away from the situation at home. Going to the clásico was one way of doing that, as was the decision to give them 10 days of vacation while in Spain.\nI honestly try to talk about the subject (virus) as little as possible, he said. Because they are already talking about it all the time, in their rooms, with their relatives back home. I dont want to talk about it as well every time I see them. I try to make training as fun as possible so I can see them smiling a bit."}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/where-do-you-go-if-you-get-coronavirus/607759/", "title": "Where Do You Go If You Get the Coronavirus ? ", "text": "“The sensitivity can be less than 100 percent and still be very useful,” Ko says, in many cases. But as that number falls, so does the usefulness of any given result. In China, the sensitivity of tests has been reported to be as low as 30 to 60 percent—meaning roughly half of the people who actually had the virus had negative test results. Using repeated testing was found to increase the sensitivity to 71 percent. But that means a negative test still couldn’t fully reassure someone like the teacher that he definitely doesn’t have the virus. At that level of sensitivity, Ko says, “if you’re especially risk-averse, do you just say: ‘If you have a cold, stay home’?”\n“An inaccurate test—one prone to false positive or false negative results, can be worse than no test at all,” Ian Lipkin, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University, told me in an email. The CDC has not shared the exact sensitivity of the testing process it has been using. When Fauci was asked about it on Monday, he once again hedged. “If it’s positive, you absolutely can make a decision,” he said. If it’s not, that’s a judgment call. Usually a second test is recommended, and it depends on the patient’s symptoms, exposures, and how sick they appear to be.\nThe tests involve other variables, too. Samples must be taken using a long cotton swab that goes into the back of the patient’s nose (or mouth, though this seems to be a less sensitive method). In either case, sometimes you just don’t get enough mucus on the swab. It can be hard to know if that was the cause of a negative test result when results come in from the lab a day later.\nRead: The official coronavirus numbers are wrong, and everyone knows it\nIn attempt to increase sensitivity of the testing process, China not only swabbed people multiple times, but also added CT scans for an additional clue. The scans can sometimes help identify the unique patterns of lung damage caused by the virus, says Howard Forman, who practices radiology in the emergency department at Yale–New Haven Hospital. But scanning is a slow process to do at large scales, and it’s costly and involves exposure to radiation. “You would need dedicated scanners as well, so as not to contaminate other patients,” he told me. “So it becomes very difficult to use CT for high-level screening.”\nGiven the number of variables, widespread screening tests for the virus are not looming on the horizon as a way to obviate the urgent need for social distancing.\nSome hope is being placed in biotech companies that are working to develop quick, mobile tests that could give results anywhere—be it at a doctor’s office or in a modified parking lot. “The goal would be to allow people to know if they have a cold or if they have the virus and need to self-quarantine, right there in the doctor’s office,” says William Brody, a radiologist and former president of Johns Hopkins University. He is currently working on one such project with Hong Cai, a molecular biologist, at a small company called Mesa. The duo told me this is, at best, months away from being tested widely. Even then, its sensitivity will remain to be seen, and will likely be less than that of the current, slower tests. But Hong says her team is working as expeditiously as possible to solve the problem."}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/were-testing-the-wrong-people/610234/", "title": "Were Testing the Wrong People - The Atlantic", "text": "Updated at 3:10 p.m. ET on April 19, 2020.\nEven as Donald Trump has delineated his plan to relax social distancing, the United States remains very much in the dark about who has the coronavirus and who does not. We have a shortage of COVID-19 tests, and we simultaneously have the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Consequently, not every American who wants a test can get one. Not every health-care worker can get one. Not even every patient entering a hospital can get one. Because of the shortages, we are rationing tests, and medical facilities and public-health officials are prioritizing the sickest patients for them.\nIf the goal is to restart the American economy, the United States isn’t performing anywhere near enough tests. Worse still, we are testing the wrong people. To safely reopen closed businesses and revive American social life, we need to perform many more tests—and focus them on the people most likely to spread COVID-19, not sick patients.\nRead: The dangerous delays in U.S. coronavirus testing haven’t stopped\nCOVID-19 testing has been an unmitigated failure in this country. This month, according to the COVID Tracking Project, a data initiative launched by The Atlantic in March, the number of tests performed in the United States has plateaued at about 130,000 to 160,000 a day. Rather than growing rapidly—as all experts think is absolutely necessary—the daily number of tests administered in some jurisdictions has even decreased. In New York, for instance, 10,241 tests were performed on April 6, but supply limits forced a huge drop a few days later to 25 total tests. Quest Diagnostics, one of the two biggest firms that run tests, just furloughed 9 percent of its workforce. In addition, Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus-response coordinator, said during a briefing last week that, of 1 million test kits distributed for use in Abbott Laboratories' high-throughput testing machines, only 88,000 had been used; news reports suggest that shortages of supplies and personnel were to blame.* Testing bottlenecks such as these are major obstacles to getting Americans out of their homes and back on the job."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/coronavirus-brady-sluder-spring-break.html", "title": "Man Who Said ,  If I Get Corona , I Get Corona , Apologizes", "text": "A young man whose bold defiance of social distancing guidelines while on spring break in Miami drew widespread attention — “If I get corona, I get corona,” he declared in a television interview — apologized this week for his comments.\n“I wasn’t aware of the severity of my actions and comments,” the man, Brady Sluder, said on Instagram on Sunday. “I’d like to take this time to own up to the mistakes i’ve made and apologize to the people I’ve offended.”\nMr. Sluder, who The Associated Press said is 22 and lives in Milford, Ohio, said in the post that he, like many people, has “elderly people who I adore more than anything in the world and other family members who are at risk.”\nIn a caption accompanying the post, Mr. Sluder said he “can’t apologize enough,” and that he wants to “use this as motivation to become a better person, a better son, a better friend, and a better citizen.”\n“Life is precious,” he said. “Don’t be arrogant and think you’re invincible like myself.”\nMr. Sluder declined to comment on Tuesday night.\nMr. Sluder, whose widely shared television interview was seen as exemplifying a kind of reckless attitude that many across the country had displayed, was in Florida on spring break last week despite warnings and calls from government officials for the public to practice social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Carl Bildt—a Swedish prime minister in the 1990s, a United Nations envoy during the Bosnian wars, and a foreign minister for many years after that—told me that, looking back on his 30-year career, he cannot remember a single international crisis in which the United States had no global presence at all. “Normally, when something happens”—a war, an earthquake—“everybody waits to see what the Americans are doing, for better or for worse, and then they calibrate their own response based on that.”\nThis time, Americans are doing … nothing. Or to be more specific, because plenty of American governors, mayors, doctors, scientists, and tech companies are doing things, the White House is doing nothing. There is no presidential leadership inside the United States; there is no American leadership in the world. Members of the G7—the U.S. and its six closest allies—did meet to write a joint statement. But even that tepid project ended in ludicrous rancor when the American secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, insisted on using the expression “Wuhan virus” and the others gave up in disgust. Not only is the president talking nonsense, not only is America absent, but the nation’s top diplomat is a caricature of a tough guy—someone who throws around insults in the absence of any capacity to influence events.\nOthers are drawing even more radical conclusions, and with remarkable speed. The “disinfectant” comments—and the laughter that followed—mark not so much a turning point as an acceleration point, the moment when a transformation that began much earlier suddenly started to seem unstoppable. Although we are still only weeks into this pandemic, although the true scale of the health crisis and the economic catastrophe is still unknown, the outline of a very different, post-American, post-coronavirus world is already taking shape. It’s a world in which American opinions will count less, while the opinions of America’s rivals will count more. And that will change political dynamics in ways that Americans haven’t yet understood.\nL\nook beyond the Lego video at China’s more serious public-relations campaign: the stunts at airports around the world, from Pakistan to Italy to Israel, designed to mark the arrival of Chinese aid—masks, surgical gowns, diagnostic tests, and sometimes doctors. These events all have a similar script: The plane lands; the receiving nation’s dignitaries go out to meet it; the Chinese experts emerge, looking competent in their hazmat gear; and everyone utters words of gratitude and relief. Of course some of this, too, is propaganda.\nRead: Why the coronavirus is so confusing\nIn reality, some of the equipment billed as aid has been purchased, not donated. Some of it, especially the diagnostic tests, has turned out to be defective. Some of those who receive these goods also know perfectly well that they are designed to silence questions about where the virus came from, why knowledge of it was initially suppressed, and why it was allowed to spread around the world. If, in these circumstances, the propaganda “works,” that’s because those who receive it have made a calculation: Pretending to believe it is a way of acknowledging and accepting Chinese power—and, perhaps, a way of expressing interest in Chinese investment."}, {"url": "https://time.com/magazine/us/5810478/april-6th-2020-vol-195-no-12-u-s/", "title": "April 6th , 2020 | Vol . 195 , No . 12 | U . S . ", "text": "Not many people were getting on airplanes in the U.S. on March 12, and even fewer were heading for the Grand Princess cruise ship. COVID-19 was discovered among the ship’s 2,400 passengers after it set sail from Hawaii, making the vessel about as popular as the Flying Dutchman; the Grand Princess had to loiter off the California coast for days before being given permission to berth.\nBut here was José Andrés, marching down an air bridge in Newark, N.J., for a 6:30 a.m. flight to San Francisco. His beige, many-pocketed vest and matching cap put out a vaguely fisherman vibe, but anyone who placed Andrés—he’s a celebrity chef—might also recognize the gear he changes into when he’s racing to the scene of disaster. The flight was long, and there was plenty of time to contemplate the dimensions of the catastrophe already silently spreading across the country below.\n“I feel like if something major happens, the America we see from this window …” he says, trailing off as he looks out over the Rocky Mountains. He had mentioned the shortages of surgical masks and corona-virus tests, and now let the next thought remain unspoken. “This is like a movie, man. Maybe we’re overreacting. But it’s O.K. to overreact in this case.”\nAndrés’ rapidly expanding charity, World Central Kitchen, is as prepared as anyone for this moment of unprecedented global crisis. The nonprofit stands up field kitchens to feed thousands of people fresh, nourishing, often hot meals as soon as possible at the scene of a hurricane, earthquake, tornado or flood. As a global public-health emergency, COVID-19 hasn’t been limited to any one place. But it pulverizes the economy as it rolls across the world, and people need money to eat. World Central Kitchen already is distributing meals in low-income neighborhoods in big cities like New York, and monitoring the globe for food shortages elsewhere, some sure to be acute.\nIn the meantime, Andrés is a lesson of leadership in crisis. In a catastrophe in which the response of the U.S. government has been slow, muddled and unsure, his kitchen models the behavior—nimble, confident, proactive—the general public needs in a crisis (and, so far, has provided it more reliably than the federal government). Consider the Grand Princess. President Donald Trump made crystal clear he would have preferred that people remain on the vessel so the infected passengers would not increase the tally of cases he appeared to see as a personal scoreboard (“I like the numbers being where they are”). Then, a few breaths later, the President said he was deferring to experts, which made life easier for the quarantined passengers and crew who disembarked, a few hundred at a time, over a week, but harder for Americans looking for the clear, unambiguous instruction that’s so essential to public health. “We have a President more worried about Wall Street going down,” says Andrés, “than about the virus itself.”\nAt the port of Oakland, where the Grand Princess finally docked, Andrés’ team made its own statement. Setting up a tent at the side of the ship, it forklifted fresh meals not only for the quarantined passengers but also for the crew. “When we hear about a tragedy, we all kind of get stuck on ‘What’s the best to way to help?’” playwright and producer Lin-Manuel Miranda, who first connected with Andrés in 2017 during the Hurricane Maria relief efforts, tells TIME. “He just hurries his ass over and gets down there.”\nAndrés, at the age of 50, is charismatic, impulsive, fun, blunt and driven, an idealist who feeds thousands and a competitor who will knock you out of the lane on the basketball court. He is also among America’s best-known cooks. His ThinkFoodGroup of more than 30 restaurants includes locations in Washington, D.C.; Florida; California; New York and five other states; and the Bahamas. They run the gamut from avant-garde fare to a food court that the New York Times restaurant critic called the best new establishment in New York in 2019. But in recent years, Andrés, an immigrant from Spain, has attracted more attention with his humanitarian work. World Central Kitchen prepared nearly 4 million meals for residents of Puerto Rico in the wake of the devastation wrought by Maria (he titled his best-selling book about it We Fed an Island). The organization has launched feeding missions in 13 countries, serving some 15 million meals and corralling more than 45,000 volunteers. Andrés was nominated for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.\nUpon landing in the Bay Area, he hopped on the phone with Nate Mook, World Central Kitchen’s executive director, to discuss a potential partnership with Panera Bread to give away meals. He put on a mask and visited the kitchen his organization had set up at the University of San Francisco, where several dozen workers prepared jambalaya and salads for quarantined passengers. He thanked his workers—many of whom are veterans of past feeding efforts—but noted the risks of overcrowding a relief kitchen in the era of COVID-19. “Less people is better,” he told a World Central Kitchen staffer. “If not, we’re going to fall like flies.”\nNext stop: the cruise ship, to distribute meals. On the ride over the Bay Bridge to Oakland, Andrés was already managing past the task at hand, as he spoke to Mook about financing a mass feeding program. “This is going to be something remembered in the history books,” he says. “This is going to be beyond Sept. 11, beyond Katrina. Think big. Because every time we think big, we deliver. And the money always shows up.” Later that evening, Andrés and his staff huddled with leaders of an Oakland-based company, Revolution Foods, who have contracts to cook and deliver school lunches: they’ve continued operating during the COVID-19 emergency. Andrés urged the company’s CEO and head chef to isolate cooks so they steer clear of infection. He coached them on forging partnerships-: with restaurants ordered shuttered, Andrés noted, many cooks will soon be out of work and itching to help.\n“My friends,” Andrés told his staff, “maybe this is why World Central Kitchen was created.”\nIt was during Hurricane Maria that Andrés learned to cut through government bureaucracy to fill a leadership vacuum and feed the masses. From a niche nonprofit supporting sustainable-food and clean-cooking initiatives in underdeveloped countries like Haiti, World Central Kitchen has become the world’s most prominent first responder for food. In some ways, the face of global disaster relief is a burly man fond of shouting “Boom!” when he hears something he likes, and leaning his body into yours when he wants to make a point. Andrés and his field workers flock to disaster sites across the world, often acting as some of the first on-the-ground social-media reporters. They’ve deployed to wildfires in California, an earthquake in Albania, a volcanic eruption in Guatemala.\nWhen Hurricane Dorian made landfall in the Bahamas last September, World Central Kitchen commandeered helicopters and seaplanes to take meals to the Abaco Islands, which lay in rubble. “In the end, we brought hope as fast as anybody has ever done it,” says Andrés. “No one told me I’m in charge of feeding the Bahamas. I said I’m in charge of feeding the Bahamas.” This year, World Central Kitchen workers went to Australia to help residents affected by the bushfires, and to Tennessee after tornadoes in the Nashville area killed at least 25 people.\nIt was not caught flat-footed by the coronavirus. In February, World Central Kitchen forklifted food onto another infected Princess cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, docked off Yokohama, Japan. Field-operations chief Sam Bloch had flown from the bushfire mission in Australia to Los Angeles and rerouted himself back across the Pacific. On March 15, as states ordered public spaces closed, Andrés announced the conversion of five of his D.C.-area restaurants, and his outlet in New York City, into community kitchens. As of March 25, World Central Kitchen has worked with partners to coordinate delivery, via 160 distribution points, of more than 150,000 safe, packaged fresh meals for families in New York City; Washington, D.C.; Little Rock, Ark.; Oakland; New Orleans; Los Angeles; Miami; Boston; and Madrid. Across the country, the organization’s “Chefs for America” online map pinpoints 346 restaurants and 567 school districts providing meals. On March 23 and 24, Andrés drove around D.C. to give out more than 13,000 N95 respirator masks, left over from prior World Central Kitchen cruise feeding operations, to health care workers fighting COVID-19 on the front lines.\n“We need to make sure we are building walls that are shorter and tables that are longer,” Andrés likes to say, making explicit his difference with Trump. He pulled out of a restaurant deal at Trump’s D.C. hotel after the candidate announced his campaign by referring to Mexicans as “rapists.” (The Trump Organization sued; ThinkFoodGroup countersued; the case was settled.) During the government shutdown in early 2019, World Central Kitchen and partners cooked 300,000 meals for furloughed federal workers living paycheck to paycheck. On a plane to Las Vegas recently, Andrés told me, a Trump supporter said to him that although he knew the chef didn’t like “my boy,” he still considered Andrés a good guy.\n“What we’ve been able to do,” says Andrés, “is weaponize empathy. Without empathy, nothing works.”\nAndrés was raised in the north of Spain, the son of nurses. Cooking was always alluring. “The touching, the transformation of things, the smells of it, the tastes of it, it brought people together,” Andrés says. “I love clay. I love fire. Maybe I’m a distant relative of Prometheus.” He is fond of telling one story: when he was a boy, he always wanted to stir the paella pan, but his father wouldn’t let him cook. He first had to learn to control the fire.\nAfter culinary school in Barcelona and a stint in the Spanish navy cooking for an admiral, Andrés arrived in New York City in 1991 as a 21-year-old chef with $50 in his pocket. He moved to D.C. a few years later to help start a Spanish-themed restaurant, Jaleo, and helped popularize tapas in the U.S. Success gave him the freedom to open more restaurants and experiment with new fare. In 2016, minibar, in D.C., which offers a tasting menu of a few dozen small courses, earned the coveted two-star Michelin rating. “He’s probably the most creative chef in the world today,” says French chef Eric Ripert, whose own flagship New York restaurant, Le Bernardin, regularly ranks among the best on the planet. Ripert points to a waffle stuffed with foie gras mousse, served at barmini—minibar’s companion cocktail and snack lounge—as an Andrés creation that blew him away. “Waffles are not supposed to be savory,” he says. “Your chances of success with that are almost none. You see it coming and you’re like, ‘What is that?’ It’s full of surprise.”\nIn an interview a few years back, Andrés, who became a U.S. citizen in 2013, said he speaks to his ingredients. But when I ask if he actually talks to his garlic, he says don’t take him literally. “If you are a cook and you don’t understand the history and physics behind water, of tomatoes, it’s very difficult for you to do anything. Come on, talking to ingredients is just, Are you aware of what you have in your hands? Are you deep in thought?”\nWhile Andrés’ restaurants caught on in the 1990s and his profile continued to rise—a PBS show, Made in Spain, for example, debuted in 2008—he homed in on philanthropy. He lent time and resources to D.C. Central Kitchen, a local charity that not only feeds the capital’s homeless and residents in need but also trains them to find cooking jobs. It was in 2010—after he visited Haiti following the earthquake that year—that he founded World Central Kitchen. “My whole history with him has been listening to him and saying, ‘You’re crazy,’” says D.C. Central Kitchen founder Robert Egger. “Then he does it. At this point if he comes to me and has an idea for an intergalactic kitchen, I’m like, ‘F-cking A, that’s good. I’m on board.’”\nThe organization pitched in on Hurricane Sandy relief in 2012, and in August 2017, Andrés traveled to Houston to help mobilize chefs after Hurricane Harvey. The work all led up to Hurricane Maria, which made landfall that September. “Puerto Rico was that moment where it’s like, O.K., it’s time to put into practice all that we’ve been soaking up over the years,” says Mook, World Central Kitchen’s executive director. “We saw the sheer paralysis of the government’s response. We realized we were on the brink of a humanitarian crisis. We said, Let’s start somewhere. Let’s start cooking.” (Andrés appeared on TIME’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world in both 2012 and 2018.)\nWorld Central Kitchen has figured out that rather than relying on packaged food airlifted in from the outside—“meals ready to eat” (MREs) in relief parlance—Andrés and his team can tap into existing supply chains and local chefs to prepare hot meals. As its profile has expanded, its revenues have ballooned from around $650,000 in 2016 to $28.5 million in 2019, and the organization now has the wherewithal to hire local help—as well as send out its own operations experts—to kick-start the food economy. Some two-thirds of World Central Kitchen’s 2019 revenues, or $19.1 million, came from individual donations, ranging from large gifts from philanthropists (including from Marc and Lynne Benioff, TIME’s owners and co-chairs) to kids giving $6 out of their allowance. Former President Bill Clinton, whose Clinton Global Initiative has supported World Central Kitchen, says Andrés’ empathic action is more crucial than ever in these divided times. “If you spend more time on your fears than your hopes, on your resentments than your compassions, and you divide people up, in an interdependent world, bad things are going to happen,” Clinton, who first spent significant time with Andrés in Haiti after the earthquake, tells TIME. “If that’s all you do, you’re not helping the people who have been victimized or left behind or overlooked. He’s a walking model of what the 21st century citizen should be.”\nAbout two months before his trip to Oakland, Andrés stomped into another airport, in San Juan, the first person off his flight from Washington, D.C. “Go do your thing, chef,” a man sitting at another gate told him as he made his way through the terminal. A 6.4-magnitude earthquake had brought Andrés back. A car was waiting to take him to the south, where the tremors damaged homes and left hungry people sleeping under tents. As his ride rushed through a lush green Puerto Rican mountainside, Andrés offered a master class in multitasking, one moment conducting ThinkFoodGroup business over the phone—“I never saw the deal. I need to see the deal before I sign sh-t,” he barked at one executive—while in another prepping his World Central Kitchen field workers for his arrival. “I’ve got good news and bad news,” he told one of them. “The bad news is, I’m coming …”\nWorking for the blunt Andrés is not for the faint of heart. On the other hand, the chaos of a restaurant kitchen translates into a disaster area. He often rubs his eyes and tugs at his beard, before expressing frustration. “I would like to say you put too much food on a tray,” he tells a few of his workers in Puerto Rico. “But that never f-cking happens.”\nDuring his 36 hours in Puerto Rico, Andrés pinballed to some half dozen World Central Kitchen sites to assist with the feeding efforts, at baseball fields, a track-and-field facility and a smaller indoor kitchen in the city of Ponce, where workers prepared ham-and-cheese sandwiches with globs of mayo. (“Makes them easy for the elderly to chew,” Andrés says.) In Peñuelas, the chef shared a quiet conversation with an overwhelmed food-truck operator World Central Kitchen had hired, urging her to change the menu for dinner before patting her on the back and departing for his next stop. In Guayanilla, Andrés went bed to bed handing out solar lights to frightened residents sleeping outside in the dark. In Yauco, he stirred meat sauce in one of World Central Kitchen’s signature giant paella pans. Within days of the earthquake, Andrés’ operation was serving 12,000 meals a day in Puerto Rico.\nOn the early-morning flight to Fort Lauderdale, Andrés earned the title of loudest snorer on board. He had been up late the previous night, enjoying a few pops of his go-to drink, the rum sour, at the San Juan restaurant whose namesake chef, Jose Enrique, first opened his kitchen doors to Andrés after Maria. And he had woken up that morning for a radio interview before the flight. In Florida, he would catch a private charter to Hurricane Dorian–damaged Marsh Harbour in the Bahamas, where hollowed-out cars still lie by the side of the road and only a stove remains where a kitchen once stood in most people’s homes. Although the hurricane had struck more than three months earlier, World Central Kitchen still had a strong presence: Andrés takes pride that his team doesn’t just parachute in. They stick around.\nAndrés went door to door, distributing some two dozen hot meals, continuing his deliveries well past dark. Afterward, he was genuinely hurt that a few of his relief workers were too wiped out to join him for dinner and a few drinks. He napped again on the ride back to the hotel—his head bobbed with such force, it seemed in danger of collapsing to the ground. But once at the hotel he wanted to stay up a little longer, sip Irish whiskey on the beach and stare at the stars.\nPerhaps Andrés crashes so hard because he lives in perpetual motion, often acting on impulse. His “plans” deserve quotation marks. He’ll shout, “Let’s go,” in his booming voice—then stick around for another hour, taking pictures, lugging a crate of apples to help feed people, talking to anyone within earshot. After leaving the cruise ship in Oakland, Andrés and his team were scheduled to hunker down in a San Francisco hotel room to figure out their strategy for feeding America in the wake of COVID-19. A staffer worked the phones to reserve a conference room. First, however, a spontaneous lunch interrupted: Andrés took five workers to a favorite Chinese restaurant, which was nearly empty because of coronavirus fears, for piles of dim sum. Then Andrés declared he wanted to move the meeting to a park. Then, instead of squatting in grass, Andrés decided that everyone, including himself, needed to find a barber to shave their beards and shorten their hair after a social-media user pointed out that facial hair can reduce the effectiveness of the N95 masks World Central Kitchen workers had been wearing. Andrés, who had been up until at least 2 a.m. on the East Coast before catching his early-morning transcontinental flight, passed out in the barber’s chair, shaving cream smeared across his neck.\nWhat looks like a scatterbrained approach can work in managing a crisis: while visiting the Bahamas, Andrés was in constant contact with his team in Puerto Rico, where another 6.0-magnitude earthquake hit after he left. But human relations are something else. If he’s idling on Twitter when you ask for his attention, it can be grating. “He’s the salt to my life because he really brings the color and the flavor,” says Andrés’ wife Patricia, who also hails from Spain; she met him in D.C. in the 1990s. “But sometimes I want to kill him, O.K.? Don’t misunderstand me. Or throw him out the window.”\nAndrés is sometimes so in his head and on mission, he’s oblivious to his surroundings. He’ll open a car door before the vehicle comes to a complete stop. He has a habit of walking in circles, staring straight ahead, while on important cell-phone calls: in Marsh Harbour, a car pulling into a takeout shop nearly hit him. In Ponce, while showing someone the proper angle at which he wanted to take a picture of lettuce growing in a greenhouse, he leaned against a rail and nearly took out a portion of the crop.\nBut a tendency to distraction belies his intense focus on whatever he’s trying to accomplish. Andrés plays to win. The day before the NBA’s All-Star Celebrity Game in February, I joined him for a training session at the National Basketball Players Association gym in New York City. His friend José Calderón, a former NBA player from Spain, works as a special assistant to the union’s executive director. During a game of 3-on-3, Andrés fouled me with his shoulders, barely attempting to move his feet. He employed similar tactics, it turns out, while playing with his daughters in the driveway of their Bethesda, Md., home. “We were 10, 12 years old, and he didn’t care,” says his eldest daughter Carlota, 21. “We were on the floor.” He wasn’t much nicer to the officials at their youth hoops contests. “He would get kicked out of my games multiple times,” Carlota says. “I think it started when I was in second grade.”\nHe brings both temper and tenderness. “I am getting very anxious,” he said in a raised voice at one of his relief workers over the phone in Puerto Rico. “Can we for once f-cking show up at the same time and the same place … Are we in control, or are we not in control?” But he’ll later tell his crew how proud he is of them, or how much he loves them. When he got wind that classmates were telling the 9-year-old daughter of one of his workers that she might get coronavirus because her father was working near the cruise ship, Andrés grabbed his colleague’s phone and recorded a video message for her and two younger siblings. “Your daddy is a hero, period,” Andrés said, choking up slightly. “So don’t worry, your daddy is going to be home soon and he is going to be taking care of all of you. And I only want you to be super proud of your dad.”\nIn the Bahamas, a woman yelled out to Andrés from her car and simply put her hands together, as if she were in church; it was her way of telling him he’s a blessing. On his way to his office in D.C. in February, a woman from Japan stopped to thank him for feeding the cruise-ship passengers docked in Yokohama. And as he walked through downtown San Francisco, puffing on a cigar, a woman approached him gingerly to tell him that she’s donated to World Central Kitchen and that it was an honor to meet him. She then tiptoed away, as if she’d just disturbed rare air.\nHis decision to head to San Francisco—where one of his workers wore a hazmat suit as he drove the forklift of food to the cruise ship—didn’t make much sense to me. The World Central Kitchen team was handling the feeding just fine. The mission was winding down. D.C. was going to serve as the Chefs for America command center to address hunger caused by COVID-19 disruptions. So why would the man who says he “wants to take the lead in feeding America” after the outbreak risk getting sick, or grounded, 2,500 miles away from home base?\nThis line of inquiry annoys him. “Sh-t, I want to be with the guys to see it and give thanks,” says Andrés on the flight west. “What a question to ask. Like, why the f-ck do you get married?” At the University of San Francisco kitchen, a chef who has worked on prior World Central Kitchen missions lights up when she spots Andrés. They exchange a hug. Andrés turns my way. “You ask me why I come,” he says. “What the f-ck? What’s wrong with you?”\nAndrés has something in common with his buddy Clinton: he craves connecting with people. His public face—yukking it up on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, pumping up World Central Kitchen on social media, giving booming speeches to audiences that hang on every word—has earned him a reputation as a tireless advocate for humanity. But he doesn’t always feel so fresh himself. On the flight from Florida to the Bahamas in January, Andrés finally set aside his phone, reclined and admitted that the expectations of feeding the world, and running some 30 restaurants, weigh on him. Over the past few years, both his parents have died. His good friend Anthony Bourdain committed suicide. Two of his daughters left for college. “You wake up in the morning, and you’re like, oooof,” says Andrés. Sometimes he feels like staying in bed. “All of this is happening in front of you and you feel like you’re losing control.”\nHe also has to fight getting in too deep. “My biggest worry is that the dream of feeding the world takes a toll on me that it becomes almost sickening,” Andrés says. “You become totally obsessed with it. You’re enjoying dinner somewhere, and you’re checking your phone. Has there been an earthquake? What’s happening in Syria? What the f-ck happened there, how are we not there? I have a company to run. I have a family. I cannot disappear from the life of other people that need me too.”\nPatricia remembers her husband waking up one morning anxious around three years ago, before Hurricane Maria, when he was already a famed, award-winning chef. “He’s like, What am I going to do with my life?” she says. “Am I doing enough? I’m not doing anything.” He still expresses such sentiments. “He doesn’t look at what he has done,” she says. “He is looking at what he still has to do.”\nThose closest to him worry that all the work is wearing him down. “I wish he could lose some weight and get fit,” says Patricia. That Nobel Peace Prize nomination and the global adoration are nice and all: just imagine, she jokingly tells him, what he could do if he were in better shape.\n“The only thing I worry is, I don’t think he spends enough time taking care of José,” says Clinton. “He works a lot. I don’t want him to burn out. I don’t want him to drop dead someday because he has a heart attack, because he never took the time to exercise, and relax and do what he needs to do. He’s a treasure. He’s a national treasure for us, and a world treasure now. He’s really one of the most special people I’ve ever known.”\nAndrés shoos away all calls to slim down: he insists he runs 325 days a year. He allows, however, that the suffering he’s seen up close at disaster scenes—dead bodies, elderly people sleeping in soiled beds, starving people eating roots and drinking filthy water—strains his mind. To cope, he sometimes turns to what he calls a “strange thought” for solace. The thought is that as more climate disasters inevitably hit both the developed and under-developed worlds, poor people in places like the Bahamas and Puerto Rico may at least be better equipped to cope. “This gives me a little bit of strange happiness only in the sense saying, You know one thing? Maybe life is preparing them for a worse moment,” says Andrés. “And actually the fittest will survive and it’s not me, it’s not us, it’s them.”\nMeanwhile, Andrés vows that World Central Kitchen will continue to grow. Splitting time between the nonprofit and his restaurants hadn’t hurt business before the COVID-19 shutdown. On the contrary, revenues had doubled in the past two years, thanks in large part to the opening of Mercado Little Spain, the food market in Manhattan’s Hudson Yards complex, though the goodwill Andrés has earned through World Central Kitchen and his rising profile have also helped. Andrés believes World Central Kitchen, at 10 years old, is still in its infancy. He and his team are learning as they go, and he’s confident that with COVID-19 threatening Americans’ familiar way of living, World Central Kitchen will pass its biggest test yet.\n“We will be there to cover the blind spots that the system will have,” Andrés says curbside at SFO, before boarding his flight back home to D.C. “You cannot expect in a crisis like this that the government will cover everything, that the super big NGOs will cover everything. We’ve already been the first ones in the front lines. And I have a feeling we’ll be the last ones leaving the front lines. That’s always the case.”\nLet’s go."}, {"url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/03/16/moscow-coronavirus-patient-escapes-hospital-quarantine-a69631", "title": "Moscow Coronavirus Patient Escapes Hospital Quarantine", "text": "A Russian patient has escaped from coronavirus quarantine near Moscow, the hospital’s head physician said Monday.\nPhysician Denis Protsenko, who didn’t specify whether the patient had tested positive for coronavirus or not, called the escape an example of “ignorant behavior” by those “who do not understand the situation and the danger of spreading Covid-19 in the city.”\nMoscow has placed people suspected of having coronavirus in the Infectious Diseases Hospital No. 1 in Kommunarka, a town in the Moscow suburbs.

Don’t panic. Nobody expects a worldwide pandemic. What’s interesting is that a lot of the old AIDS activists have started rising up. There’s a COVID-19 working group in New York City, which has a lot of the activists who were involved in the early AIDS response. A lot of the old physicians and scientists from that time too. This happened during Ebola in 2014 and 2015 too, around the health-care-worker quarantines in the U.S. The AIDS activists were protesting outside of Bellevue on behalf of the doctors who were being quarantined.\nHamblin:I remember at that point you were worried about it from a human-rights perspective, that the government shouldn’t be forcing people into quarantine.\nGonsalves:Yes, it was very different, mostly because we didn’t have an Ebola epidemic in the United States. Now, in the context of COVID-19, we need to be thinking about testing, contact tracing, and isolation. But I’ve never been in a situation before where quarantine made sense. Even in the AIDS epidemic, it didn’t make sense.\nHamblin:With the Ebola quarantines, there were, if I recall correctly, guards outside of people’s houses. This was enforced.\nGonsalves:People were very spooked by [Ebola] in a way that they’re not now, with a real virus in their midst. There was much more paranoid fearmongering in New Haven around Ebola when there was no Ebola to be found within 6,000 miles.\nWells:Why do you think that is?\nGonsalves:I think the Ebola fear is tied to a deep racism about Africa. There’s a racist epistemology built into viruses and disease from Africa.\nWells:We’ve seen some racism tied to coronavirus as well.\nGonsalves:Yes, with China. People react to threats in different ways. We have people who are rising to the challenge, whether they’re health-care workers or people at the Stop & Shop who are going into work every day, putting themselves on the front lines in another way. There’s a lot of heroic stuff happening. At the same time, there’s really bizarre things, like the takeover of the Michigan state capitol yesterday. But it is amazing how many people have been social distancing without a threat that they can see in front of them. They just know that it’s something they have to do.\nWells:About that question from our listener: I think the listener was concerned about stigmatization and criminalization of COVID-19. And there are a couple of examples that we’ve seen. Because COVID-19 is so widespread, it’s different [from previous infectious diseases]. But there are a couple of examples of criminalization we’ve seen. The Department of Justice has declared that federal anti-terrorism laws can be used to prosecute anyone who threatens or attempts to spread the coronavirus. New Jersey criminal laws have been used to charge a man who allegedly threatened and then coughed on a grocery-store clerk in Pennsylvania. A woman who is not believed to have the coronavirus is facing charges for purposefully coughing on bread. What do you think about that?

But after the West African Ebola epidemic, and now with COVID-19, I know I am not necessarily that strong. The hair stands up on the back of my neck when I hear ethicists, hospital administrators, and politicians, sitting in their safe offices, lecture me on my obligation to die providing health- care. We don’t take these risks because of an abstract “ethical duty”; we take them because it is what we do every time we walk into the chaos and danger of the emergency department. We do it because it is our job.\nRead: How the coronavirus became an American catastrophe\nYes, physicians and nurses have an ethical duty to provide care. (I have even written about it.) The perspective of medical ethicists is pretty straightforward—health-care providers, especially physicians, should continue to care for the sick even if it puts their life at risk. We have an obligation to treat all patients, because we chose our profession and are well rewarded by society with money and respect. Nurses have a similar professional duty, but have specific exemptions. But there are few, if any, obligations for all the support staff that make my work possible—the techs, clerks, registrars, environmental staff. They don’t take an oath. Some are paid minimum wage, have few benefits, and get none of the societal accolades reserved for doctors and nurses. Why should they die for a $25,000-a-year job and $10,000 worth of life insurance?

If health-care providers are going to risk their life, then there is a reciprocal obligation—thefairness principle—that society, employers, and hospitals keep them safe and ensure that they are fairly treated, whether they live, get sick, or die.\nFirst, hospitals must provide the resources necessary to protect the staff caring for infected patients—not just PPE, but also training, environmental controls, and policies and procedures to prevent spread. At a minimum, providers should be offered a free place to stay away from their family and be compensated for the time that they may not be able to touch their own children.

Also known as an index case, patient zero is a term used to describe the first human infected by a viral or bacterial disease in an outbreak.\nAdvances in genetic analysis now make it possible to trace back the lineage of a virus through those it has infected. Combined with epidemiological studies, scientists can pinpoint individuals who may have been the first people to start spreading the disease and so trigger the outbreak.\nIdentifying who these people are can help address crucial questions about how, when and why it started. These can then help to prevent more people from getting infected now or in future outbreaks.\nDo we know who patient zero is in the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak that started in China?\nThe short answer is – no.\nChinese authorities originally reported that the first coronavirus case was on 31 December and many of the first cases of the pneumonia-like infection were immediately connected to a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, in the Hubei province.\nYou might also like:\n• The row over the the new coronavirus name\n• How to fight a coronavirus\n• The places that escaped Spanish flu\nThis region is the epicentre of the outbreak, with almost 82% of the 75,000-plus cases registered so far in China and globally are from here, according to statistics complied by Johns Hopkins University. (Read more about the global fight against coronavirus.)\nThe Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was been linked to early cases of coronavirus and was quickly closed by the authorities (Credit: Getty Images)\nHowever, a study, by Chinese researchers published in the Lancet medical journal, claimed the first person to be diagnosed with Covid-19, was on 1 December 2019 (a lot of earlier) and that person had \"no contact\" with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.\nWu Wenjuan, a senior doctor at Wuhan's Jinyintan Hospital and one of the authors of the study, told the BBC Chinese Service that the patient was an elderly man who suffered from Alzheimer's disease.\n\"He (the patient) lived four or five buses from the seafood market, and because he was sick he basically didn't go out,” Wu Wenjuan said.\nShe also said that three other people developed symptoms in the following days – two of whom had no exposure to Huanan either.\nResearchers also found that 27 people of a sample of 41 patients admitted to hospital in the early stages of the outbreak had been exposed to the market\nHowever, the researchers also found that 27 people of a sample of 41 patients admitted to hospital in the early stages of the outbreak \"had been exposed to the market\".\nThe hypothesis that the outbreak started at the market and could have been transmitted from a living animal to a human host before spreading human-to-human is still considered the most likely, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nSo can one person really trigger a massive outbreak?\nThe 2014 to 2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was the largest since the virus responsible was first discovered in 1976. It killed in excess of 11,000 people and infected over 28,000, according to the World Health Organization.\nThe outbreak lasted more than two years and was found in 10 countries, mostly in Africa but there were also cases reported in the US, Spain, the United Kingdom and Italy.\nThe Ebola outbreak that swept across West Africa has been traced to a young boy from Guinea who is thought to have caught the virus from bats (Credit: Getty Images)\nScientists concluded this outbreak of a new strain of Ebola started with just one person – a two-year-old boy from Guinea – who may have been infected by playing in a hollow tree housing a colony of bats.\nThey made the connection on an expedition to the boy's village, Meliandou, taking samples and chatting to locals to find out more about the Ebola outbreak's source before publishing their findings.\nBut perhaps the most well known “patient zero” is Mary Mallon, who earned the nickname Typhoid Mary for causing an outbreak of typhoid fever in New York in 1906.\nOriginally from Ireland, Mallon emigrated to the US, where she began working for rich families as a cook. After clusters of typhoid cases among wealthy families in New York, doctors traced the outbreak to Mallon. Anywhere she worked, members of the household started to develop typhoid fever.\nDoctors called her a healthy carrier – someone infected by a disease but who display little or no symptoms of the disease, which means they often go on to infect many other people.\nThere is now growing evidence that some people are more \"efficient\" than others at spreading viruses and Mallon is one of the earliest recorded cases of a person having this \"ability\" known as a \"super-spreader\".\nAt that time the disease afflicted several thousand New Yorkers annually and had a 10% fatality rate.\nMary Mallon was nicknamed Typhoid Mary after she was found to have caused infections in a number of wealthy families in New York (Credit: Getty Images)\nBut the term “patient zero” comes loaded with meaning and stigma. Many health experts are against identifying the first documented case of an outbreak, for fear that it might lead to disinformation about the disease or even victimisation of the person.\nA famous example is a man who was mistakenly identified as \"patient zero\" of the Aids epidemic.\nGaetan Dugas, a Canadian homosexual flight attendant, is one of the most demonised patients in history, being blamed for spreading HIV to the US in the 1980s. But three decades later, scientists revealed he couldn't be the first case – a 2016 study showed the virus had moved from the Caribbean to America at the beginning of the 1970s.\nCuriously, it was during the HIV epidemic that the term patient zero was accidently created.\nWhilst investigating the spread of the disease in Los Angeles and San Francisco in the early 80s, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) used the letter \"O\" to refer a case of someone \"outside the state of California\".\nOther researchers wrongfully interpreted the letter as a number 0 – and so the concept of patient zero was born.\n--\nAs an award-winning science site, BBC Future is committed to bringing you evidence-based analysis and myth-busting stories around the new coronavirus update.

The second round of voting is set to take place in a week's time.\n\"I say this with seriousness: we must all show more discipline in the application of these measures,\" insisted Philippe.\n\"What we have to do at the moment is simply to avoid gathering as much as possible, limit friendly and family gatherings, use public transport only to go to work and only if the physical presence at work is essential, only go out of your home to do essential shopping, do some exercise or vote,\" he said.\nPhilippe deplored having \"seen too many people in cafes, restaurants\".\n\"I would be happy to see it in normal times, but for a few weeks it is not what we have to do,\" he added, noting that \"the first measures taken to limit gatherings were imperfectly applied\".\nItaly applause for medical staff\nThe silence engulfing Italy as its lockdown continues was pierced on Saturday as people came onto their balconies to applaud medical staff.\nBut there was more bad news in the early evening when the latest figures came out: 175 deaths and 3,000 new infections in 24 hours.\nEarlier, new measures had been introduced in Milan and Rome as parks, public gardens and playgrounds were shut.\nThe country has been on nationwide lockdown since March 9 and citizens require \"certified, serious and justifiable\" reasons for travelling.\nAuthorities have checked 157,000 people, 7,000 of which will be prosecuted for failing to comply with restrictions, according to Italy's interior ministry.\nHealthcare staff are reportedly exhausted and under pressure, especially in Lombardy, the worst-hit region with 966 deaths.\nThe main daily newspaper in the Bergamo region, Eco di Bergamo, has published eleven pages of classified ads for deaths.\nIn Rome, several hospitals are frantically setting up new ICU and sub ICU units to face the COVID-19 emergency in the Lazio region.\nThe Gemelli University Hospital is creating 21 new intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 28 new general hospitalisation beds, as part of the new Columbus Covid 2 Hospital, an area fully dedicated to the COVID-19 cases in order to support the regional health hub to contain the pandemic.\nOnce completed, Columbus Covid 2 Hospital will have 74 new beds and 59 ICU beds: 20 doctors and 65 nurses working on ordinary hospitalisations while 48 anaesthetists and 180 nurses will be committed to intensive care.\nThe Columbus Covid 2 Hospital will begin operating as of March 16.\nEurope new 'epicentre' of the pandemic\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday that the continent — where more countries have declared a national state of emergency over COVID-19 — is now the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"More cases are now being reported every day [in Europe] than were being reported by China at the height of its epidemic,\" director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nHe said 5,000 people have now died of the virus, calling it \"a tragic milestone,\" and urged governments to implement social distancing measures to slow the spread.\n\"Do not let this fire burn,\" he said. \"Isolate the sick.\"\nEU divided over border measures\nEU President Ursula von der Leyen has condemned some European countries for introducing blanket travel bans and border closures in response to coronavirus, saying: 'The single market has to function'.\nAustria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic are among the nations forbidding entry to anyone arriving from Italy or without a certificate of health.\n\"It is not good when member states take unilateral action because it always causes a domino effect and that prevents urgently-needed medical equipment from reaching patients and hospitals,\" she said.\n\"It amounts to the reintroduction of internal borders at a time when solidarity between member states is needed.\"\nShe made the comments as she announced new Europe-wide guidelines on health checks at border crossings and the suspension of rules forbidding state aid as part of a €37 billion rescue package to fight the impact of COVID-19.\nThe pandemic is \"a major shock\" for Europe's economy, she said, \"but we must work together to ensure it is as short and as limited as possible.\"\nVon der Leyen said she understood the pressure on countries to protect themselves from the spread of coronavirus.\n\"Certain controls may be justified but general travel bans are not seen as being the most effective by the WHO,\" she said. \"Moreover, they have a strong social and economic impact, they disrupt people's lives and business across the borders concerned. Any measure that is taken must be proportionate.\"\nShe said: \"I want to be very clear — the single market has to function.\"\nEuropean health systems at 'high' risk\nThe EU warned that healthcare systems across Europe are at \"high\" risk of being overwhelmed by coronavirus as the death toll in Italy surged past 1,000 and financial markets suffered their worst losses on record.\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) urged countries to begin prioritising cases to protect the elderly and vulnerable.\n\"A rapid shift from containment to a mitigation approach is required\" ahead of an expected spike in cases, it said. \"The risk of healthcare system capacity being exceeded in the EU/EEA and the UK in the coming weeks is considered high.\""}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/ebe3263e8ce24cf0288943fb11d96b6a", "title": "NY family COVID - 19 diagnosis sparks quarantines , closures", "text": "11 in NY have new virus, many with ties to afflicted lawyer\nNEW YORK (AP) — Health officials seeking to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus in New York state focused Wednesday on a suburban community where nine people connected with a lawyer hospitalized with the disease have now tested positive. Hundreds of people were ordered to self-quarantine as the new results pushed the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state to 11.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo said the disease appeared to have been passed from the lawyer to his family and other people they’re close with in New Rochelle, north of New York City, in what experts call “community spread.” After his diagnosis, tests came back positive for the lawyer’s wife, two children and a neighbor, as well as one of his friends and members of that man’s family.\nCuomo said hundreds of people are in quarantine in connection to the latest cases. People who’ve come into contact with them will be tested and should sequester themselves in their homes, he said. They include people who worked with the lawyer and his wife at their law firm, hospital workers who treated him, the son’s college roommate, and scores of people who attended events at their synagogue in recent weeks. Two school districts also canceled classes.\n“Whenever you find a case, it is about containment and doing the best you can to keep the circle as tight as possible,” Cuomo said.\nThe 50-year-old lawyer, who commuted by train from New Rochelle to work at a small Manhattan law firm, has an underlying respiratory illness that potentially put him in more danger from the disease, officials said. He is being treated in the intensive care unit of a Manhattan hospital.\nCuomo said the lawyer had no known travel history to countries where the outbreak of the new coronavirus has been sustained. State and city officials said the man had done some other traveling recently, including an early February trip to Miami.\nThe lawyer’s wife and their 14-year-old daughter were asymptomatic, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The 20-year-old son had some symptoms but is getting better, de Blasio said. All three are quarantined at their home. The neighbor, who had driven the lawyer to get medical attention when he was experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, and the other family that has been diagnosed are also under self-quarantine at home.\nYeshiva University, where the 20-year-old is a student, canceled classes at one of its Manhattan campuses through at least Friday. De Blasio said two people he had close contact with — a roommate and a friend — were being tested. Yeshiva University’s three other campuses are unaffected. The school has an enrollment of about 6,000 students, including about 2,700 undergraduate students.\nThe Bronx school that the 14-year-old attends will remain closed into next week. Westchester Torah Academy, where the children from the other affected family are students, is also closed. Services were canceled at the synagogue that the lawyer’s family attended. The school district in Hastings-on-Hudson said it was closing Thursday and Friday “out of an abundance of caution” because a parent had been in contact with a person under quarantine. Mount Vernon City School District said Wednesday on their website that schools will be closed until Monday so cleaning crews can disinfect buildings.\nWestchester County health officials on Tuesday directed the family’s synagogue, Young Israel of New Rochelle, to halt services immediately. Congregants who attended Feb. 22 services as well as a funeral and a bat mitzvah on Feb. 23 were directed to quarantine themselves at least through Sunday.\nCounty officials said they will mandate quarantines for those who do not comply.\nYoung Israel Rabbi Reuven Fink said the lawyer is “quite ill” and asked for prayers for him and his family. He told congregants that following the quarantine order is “a sacred obligation that we all must take very seriously.”\n“This is a very emotionally trying time for us all,” Fink said in a statement posted to the synagogue’s Facebook page. “When we first heard of the Coronavirus it seemed so remote. It has now come not only to our doorstep, but has pierced our lives.”\nIn another development, Cuomo said state-run universities are recalling about 300 study-abroad students and faculty from China, Italy, Japan, Iran and South Korea, places where the numbers of coronavirus cases have been growing. Cuomo said they will be flown back to the U.S. on a charter flight and quarantined for 14 days.\nDe Blasio said public school trips to those countries have been canceled. He said there has been no noticeable change in city public school attendance.\nTaxi regulators are telling drivers and owners to clean their cars with disinfectant products at least once a day, paying special attention to surfaces that are touched often, such as door handles, arm rests, and seat belts. Uber said it has similar protocols in place.\nAlso Wednesday, the city declared face masks to be temporarily in short supply, triggering consumer protection rules that make it illegal for stores to price gouge.\nThe new positive tests for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 came one day after Cuomo announced that the lawyer had become the second case in New York state.\n“The more you test, the more positive cases you will find,” Cuomo said.\nIn what he said was a bit of good news, Cuomo announced Wednesday that tests in other suspected COVID-19 cases around the state had come back negative, including for the husband of the first patient diagnosed in the state. Both the husband and the wife are healthcare workers who recently traveled together to Iran, where the disease is widespread.\nCuomo said the woman, 39, is continuing to recover at home. De Blasio said despite the husband’s negative test, he would still be subject to the same quarantine mandate as a precaution.\nAs he has in recent days, the governor sought to reassure the public that the disease is often passed by close contact, not casual contact like riding in the same subway car as a person who may be sick.\n“We have an epidemic caused by coronavirus,” Cuomo said. “But we have a pandemic that is caused by fear.”\n___\nMarina Villeneuve in Albany and Karen Matthews in New York City contributed to this report.\n___\nOn Twitter, follow Sisak at twitter.com/mikesisak and Peltz at twitter.com/jennpeltz\nFor more coverage, visit: https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak"}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/you-will-adjust-new-normal/607873/", "title": "You Will Adjust to the New Normal", "text": "Yesterday, Americans got three pieces of news that changed how seriously many will take the coronavirus pandemic: President Donald Trump suspended entry by most foreign nationals from 26 European countries for the next 30 days; the NBA suspended its season; and the actor Tom Hanks announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.\nAs a result, millions of Americans are just now beginning to process the severity of the situation in the way that information junkies have been doing for weeks. If you’re feeling overwhelmed as you try to assess what this all means for you and your family, know that this is a normal and perhaps even useful response. “The adjustment reaction is an emotional rehearsal, getting you psychologically ready to cope if you have to,” Peter Sandman, an expert on risk management, has written. “It is also a logistical rehearsal; it’s how you start figuring out what to do and how to do it.”\nMeghan O’Rourke: The shift Americans must make to fight the coronavirus\nAlong with Jody Lanard, Sandman wrote a primer on preparing large populations for pandemics, which I’ve found to be a useful resource over the past couple of weeks.

This proved a blessing for some businesses. Chinese social media took off. So did e-commerce. Richard Liu, who ran a chain of consumer-electronics shops, shut all his brick-and-mortar stores and set up JD.com. The firm is now valued at $64bn.\nA novel coronavirus that has brought China to a halt this year is boosting another fledgling industry: telemedicine. As hospitals turn away patients with other ailments and many Chinese are confined to their homes or steer clear of clinics for fear of infection, millions are seeking treatment and advice on the internet. The government is egging them on.\nXin Lijun, boss of JD Health, says that his platform’s monthly consultations have grown tenfold since the outbreak, to 2m. Some 1.6m tuned in to a talk by a top cardiologist that the JD.com subsidiary live-streamed. Without the outbreak, the shift in consumer behaviour would have taken perhaps five years, reckons Mr Xin. Chen Qiaoshan of Analysys, a consultancy in Beijing, thinks that China’s online health-care market may near 200bn yuan ($29bn) this year, up from her pre-outbreak estimate of 158bn yuan.\nChina’s telemedicine market—including consultations and drug sales—had been predicted to grow vigorously even before the latest epidemic. Ping An Good Doctor, a medical-services app run by a big insurer, claimed in September that over 300m had registered on it, equivalent to one in three internet users in China. Tianyancha, a data firm, counts over 1,000 home-grown telemedicine companies.\nUntil now, however, most of these firms have stuck to delivering drugs or, in Ping An’s case, booking appointments with specialists, whom Chinese patients favour over general practitioners, even if it means queuing for hours at a hospital. Prestigious “AAA” hospitals account for one in ten public institutions but receive half of all outpatients. And the many Chinese who believe in traditional medicine, with its injunction that a reliable diagnosis cannot be made without feeling the pulse, would not dream of accepting health advice by video link.\nAuthorities, too, have been cautious. In many countries, including America, the world’s biggest telemedicine market, most insurers do not reimburse patients’ online expenses. Nor, in all but a few regions, does China’s national health-insurance scheme. Most Chinese online doctors are permitted only to handle repeat prescriptions and follow-up consultations, not make an initial diagnosis. A draft government policy from 2017 took “a negative tone” on internet hospitals and recommended they be shut down, recalls Li Tiantian, founder of Dingxiang Doctor, which runs a medical myth-busting-and-advice forum.\nLast year the government began to lift some restrictions, such as a ban on the sale of prescription drugs. But covid-19, as the new disease is known, has accelerated the shift. At the peak of the epidemic in early February a health-ministry directive mandated that internet-based medical services be given “full play” to diagnose and treat patients. Another encouraged hospitals to give online consultations. Jiangsu province, China’s industrial powerhouse, authorised reimbursements for online medical care. So have cities including Shanghai and Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, where covid-19 first emerged.\nTelemedicine firms are trying to win over the government and consumers by behaving like good corporate citizens. Many, including JD Health, are offering patients consultations free of charge while the epidemic lasts. Ali Health, an arm of Alibaba, China’s e-commerce titan, launched a free “online clinic” for residents of Hubei, which has been under lockdown; in five days 100,000 patients got a remote consultation. WeDoctor, an app backed by Tencent, a tech giant, mobilised 20,000 physicians to work online for no pay. Ping An set up an “antivirus command centre” to dispatch free face masks around the country. Dingxiang Doctor got epilepsy medication to 300 children in Hubei amid an acute shortage of suppliers and delivery firms. Its real-time heat map tracking covid-19 infections has been viewed 2.5bn times.\nAll this is costing the companies money. But, says Mr Xin of JD Health, it makes “little sense” to focus on profit at the moment. What matters, he adds, is how covid-19 has made people think twice about rushing to hospital and helped foster trust in general practitioners, who provide the bulk of online advice. It has also broadened the appeal of firms like his, beyond middle-aged patients with chronic conditions to web-savvy youngsters seeking advice for parents and grandparents and healthy types simply seeking reassurance. Of the 10m people who have turned to the internet for health services in the past month, perhaps half were first-time online patients, says Ms Chen. At least a third are likely to keep using such apps, she estimates.\nRemote possibilities\nIt is not just patients and politicians who are embracing telemedicine. JD Health has lured more pharmacies to its platform (in part by waiving the fee it earns on drug orders in Hubei). China’s underpaid, overworked doctors are also keen. Xiao Xingxing left a AAA hospital in Beijing to consult full-time for JD Health; many old colleagues and classmates are doing the same, she reports. And against the backdrop of a global, virus-induced stockmarket rout, Chinese online health firms offer a tonic to ailing investors. This year the share prices in Ping An Healthcare and Ali Health are up by 33% and 74%, respectively. ■\nThis article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline \"The smartphone will see you now\""}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/germany-slams-abuse-of-french-visitors-over-coronavirus/a-53097380", "title": "Germany slams abuse of French visitors over coronavirus | News | DW", "text": "Visitors from France faced harassment in the German border town of Gersheim for fear of infections, according to the local mayor.

The government’s reaction is in the spotlight, after Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on Wednesday evening that Finland would not introduce social distancing measures at this stage.\nRural paper Maaseudun Tulevaisuus publishes a column from its duty editor Niklas Holmberg outlining the seriousness of the situation.\n\"Hand-washing is no longer enough, the corona pandemic tests democracies’ ability to handle crises,\" reads the headline, before a text that details the challenges faced by Finland and other countries as the pandemic tightens its grip.\nThe text makes the point that China appears to have stopped the virus in its tracks in Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, using strict social distancing measures to stop the spread of infections.\nAlthough Finnish officials still say such measures are not yet necessary here, the text argues that time will soon be upon us.\n\"Within a week at the latest Finland will move to an emergency situation for the first time since the second world war,\" argues Holmberg.\nDemocracies are now to be tested, and the results could be far-reaching because, as Holmberg says, \"if China succeeds and western countries fail, it will change the global balance of power\".\nFlattening the curve\nHelsingin Sanomat, meanwhile, looks at the numbers. The growth rate in Finland is on the same trajectory as Sweden, which suffered its first coronavirus fatality on Wednesday.\nThat means hand-washing and travel restrictions won’t be enough to reduce the infection rate and ease the burden on healthcare systems, says HS.\nItaly has placed the whole country in lockdown, and China did the same in Hubei province — but western responses have been criticised by medical journal The Lancet as 'too little, too late'.\nThe HS column recommends that sport events and concerts are streamed online instead of in front of live audiences, that people work from home as much as possible, and that meetings and events are cancelled.\nThe goal is to 'flatten the curve', that is, delay the peak of the epidemic and reduce its extent to ease the burden on healthcare systems.\nOtherwise, says HS, Finland will have more victims of the virus than necessary.\nStubb v Trump\nThe paper also reports on one example of social distancing that is already taking place: police are to cease the checkpoint drink-driving breathalyser tests they often perform in the spring.\nThat doesn’t mean motorists are free to drink and drive, however — if police suspect a driver of behaving erratically, they will still stop and breathalyse them.\nThe online editions were also full of coverage of US President Donald Trump’s move to ban travellers from the Schengen area countries from travelling to America -- with many exceptions to the rules.\nFinnair told IS that they would hold a meeting to discuss the policy on Thursday, while former PM Alexander Stubb’s tweet also brought some coverage in the papers.\nStubb noted that it was not entirely logical to exclude Britain from the ban, calling the decision ‘irresponsible’.\n\"Viruses do not recognise borders. Decisions should be based on facts, not politics,\" said Stubb.\nAt the time of writing, former Apprentice host Trump had not replied to the tweet."}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/04/03/covid-19s-death-toll-appears-higher-than-official-figures-suggest", "title": "Fatal flaws - Covid - 19 death toll appears higher than official figures suggest | Graphic detail", "text": "THE SPREAD of covid-19 is most often measured by two numbers: how many people are infected, and how many have died. The first is very uncertain. Some carriers show no symptoms, and most countries do not test people who seem healthy. Because data on infections are unreliable, researchers have focused on deaths. Yet new statistics suggest that current fatality numbers may also understate the damage.\nOfficial death tolls for covid-19 may exclude people who died before they could be tested. They also ignore people who succumbed to other causes, perhaps because hospitals had no room to treat them. The latter group has been large in other disasters. For example, when Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017, America recorded only 64 deaths. A study later found that the surge in total deaths was close to 3,000. Many occurred in hospitals that lost power.\nSuch analysis is not yet possible for nations battling covid-19. The only European country whose total death rate (as calculated by EuroMOMO, a research group) had spiked by March 20th was Italy. This estimate is based on a group of cities. Unfortunately, Italy does not break down covid-19 deaths by city, precluding a comparison of covid-19 and total deaths in the same area.\nHowever, journalists and scholars have crunched their own numbers. L’Eco di Bergamo, a newspaper, has obtained data from 82 localities in Italy’s Bergamo province. In March these places had 2,420 more deaths than in March 2019. Just 1,140, less than half of the increase, were attributed to covid-19. “The data is the tip of the iceberg,” Giorgio Gori, the mayor of Bergamo’s capital, told L’Eco. “Too many victims are not included in the reports because they die at home.”\nComparable figures can be found across Europe. In Spain El País, a newspaper, has published the results of a study by the government’s health research centre, showing that “excess” deaths in the Castile-La Mancha region were double the number attributed to covid-19. Jean-Marc Manach, a French reporter, has found a similar disparity in the department of Haut-Rhin.\nThese differences may shrink over time. Official counts of covid-19 fatalities could be updated to include people who have already died, because confirming the cause sometimes takes several days. The toll from other types of death might fall soon: lockdowns could reduce accidents and violence, and many frail covid-19 victims were already likely to die of other causes. And mortality data are noisy in smaller regions—especially hard-hit ones that may not be representative of entire countries.\nStill, the official covid-19 count will always seem too low in places like Nembro, a Bergamasque town of 11,000 people. It suffered 152 deaths in March, with only 39 attributed to the virus so far. “Almost all the old people got it,” says Luca Foresti, a researcher. “And therefore they died, a lot.” ■\nSources: Claudio Cancelli; Luca Foresti; L'Eco di Bergamo; El País; INSEE; Santé Publique France; Ministero della Salute; Tuttitalia; Ministerio de Sanidad; Datadista; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Instituto Nacional de Estadística; InTwig\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus hub\nThis article appeared in the Graphic detail section of the print edition under the headline \"Fatal flaws\""}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-coronavirus-euro-11585248626", "title": "The Coronavirus Euro", "text": "- Opinion\n- Review & Outlook\nThe Coronavirus Euro\nBe wary of overhauling the currency bloc to fight the virus.\nBad crises tend to produce worse policy, and nowhere is that as true as with growing calls to overhaul the euro currency to respond to the coronavirus health emergency.

Lower fuel costs will help offset some of the lost revenue,” said Alexandre de Juniac, director general and chief executive of Iata. “This will be a very tough year for airlines.”\nThe vast majority of the financial impact will hit airlines in the Asia Pacific region, where revenues will fall by $27.8bn, with the bulk borne by carriers registered in China. Iata estimates that losses in China’s domestic market will hit $12.8bn. Carriers outside Asia Pacific are forecast to lose about $1.5bn this year, “assuming the loss of demand is limited to markets linked to China”.\nIata said: “The sharp downturn in demand as a result of Covid-19 will have a financial impact on airlines – severe for those particularly exposed to the China market. These estimates are based on a scenario where Covid-19 has a similar V-shaped impact on demand as was experienced during Sars. That was characterised by a six-month period with a sharp decline followed by an equally quick recovery.”\nDe Juniac warned that Iata’s assessment was based on the coronavirus public health emergency not spreading beyond China. “If it spreads more widely to Asia Pacific markets then impacts on airlines from other regions would be larger,” he said.\nIata said it was “premature” to estimate what the revenue loss would mean for the global profitability of the airline industry.

The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n— 13 hospitalized, 1 dead from cruise ship with coronavirus victims in Miami\n— Washington will return over 400 ventilators to be given to harder-hit states\n— South Korea reports 47 new cases of coronavirus\n— UN Secretary-General says domestic violence reports on rise during pandemic\n— China reports 38 new coronavirus cases, all but one imported\n— British Prime Minister Johnson admitted to a hospital with the coronavirus.\n— Bronx Zoo tiger tests positive for the coronavirus.\n— Fauci: Very good chance coronavirus “will assume a seasonal nature.”\n___\nSEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s vice health minister has urged vigilance to maintain hard-won gains against the new coronavirus.\nKim Gang-lip expressed concerns over loosened attitudes toward social distancing that he says puts the country at potential risk of an infection “explosion” similar to Europe and the United States.\nHis warning on Monday came after the country reported 47 new cases of the coronavirus, the smallest daily jump since Feb. 20. Infections have continued to wane in the worst-hit city of Daegu, where 6,781 of the country’s 10,284 cases have been reported.\nHowever, there’s alarm over a steady rise in infections linked to international arrivals as students and other South Korean nationals flock back from the West amid broadening outbreaks and suspended school years. This has inflated the caseload in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea’s 51 million people live, prompting Gyeonggi province governor Lee Jae-myung to warn last week that an “explosion in infections is almost certain.”\n“There’s still danger that an explosion in local transmissions which we have been seeing in Europe and the United States can happen in our society at any time, which would collapse our hospital system and spike death rates,” Kim said.\nKim pleaded for people to stay at home, citing smartphone data that showed increased crowds in Seoul’s public parks and leisure districts over the past two weeks. While South Korea’s government has shut schools and issued social-distancing guidelines for the public, it has not enforced lockdowns or ordered unessential businesses to close.\n___\nMIAMI — Authorities say 14 people have been taken to hospitals from a cruise ship that docked in Florida with coronavirus victims aboard and one of them has died.\nTwo fatalities were reported earlier aboard the Coral Princess, which docked Saturday in Miami. The ship had more than 1,000 passengers and nearly 900 crew members.\nAuthorities did not immediately disclose whether the 14 people removed for immediate medical attention had a confirmed coronavirus link.\nThe Princess Cruises line ship began disembarking fit passengers cleared for charter flights Sunday. The cruise line said it was delayed by a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention policy preventing passengers from being placed on commercial flights.\nAnyone with symptoms of the disease or recovering from it were being kept on ship until medically cleared.\n___\nOLYMPIA, Wash. -- Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said the state will return more than 400 ventilators of the 500 it has received from the federal government so they can go to New York and other states hit harder by the coronavirus.\nThe Democratic governor said Sunday that his statewide stay-at-home order and weeks of social distancing have led to slower rates of infections and deaths in Washington.\nWashington state has 7,666 confirmed cases of the virus and 322 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally on Sunday afternoon. New York has more than 122,000 confirmed cases and more than 4,000 deaths.\nWashington received 500 ventilators last month from the Strategic National Stockpile.\n“I’ve said many times over the last few weeks: We are in this together,” Inslee said. “This should guide all of our actions at an individual and state level in the coming days and weeks.”\n___\nSEOUL, South Korea — South Korea has reported 47 new cases of the coronavirus and three more fatalities, bringing its totals to 10,284 infections and 186 deaths.\nSouth Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday said at least 769 of the infections were linked to passengers arriving from overseas, with most of the cases detected in the past three weeks in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area.\nThe country’s caseload has slowed from early March, when it was reporting around 500 new cases a day, but officials have raised concern over a steady rise in infections imported from overseas or occurring in hospitals, nursing homes and other live-in facilities.\nDuring the weekend, officials extended a government guideline urging people to social distance to slow the spread of the virus by two weeks, guarding against increasing infections in the Seoul metropolitan area and broadening outbreaks in Europe and the United States.\n___\nUNITED NATIONS — United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says there has been “a horrifying global surge in domestic violence” in recent weeks as fear of the coronavirus pandemic has grown along with its social and economic consequences.\nThe U.N. chief, who appealed on March 23 for an immediate cease-fire in conflicts around the world to tackle COVID-19, said in a statement Sunday night it is now time to appeal for an end to all violence, “everywhere, now.”\nGuterres said that “for many women and girls, the threat looms largest where they should be safest — in their own homes.”\n“And, so, I make a new appeal today for peace at home — and in homes — around the world,” he said.\nThe secretary-general said in some countries, which he didn’t name, “the number of women calling support services has doubled.”\nAt the same time, he said, health care providers and police are overwhelmed and understaffed, local support groups are paralyzed or short of funds, and some domestic violence shelters are closed while others are full.\n“I urge all governments to make the prevention and redress of violence against women a key part of their national response plans for COVID-19,” Guterres said.\n___\nBEIJING -- China on Monday reported 39 new cases of coronavirus infection — 38 of them imported — one additional death, 10 suspected cases and 1,047 asymptomatic cases under observation.\nThere were no new confirmed or suspected cases in the epicenter city of Wuhan, where a 14-week lockdown is due to be lifted on Wednesday.\nChina has now recorded a total of 81,708 cases and 3,331 deaths since the COVID-19 illness was first detected there in late December.\n___\nLONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been admitted to a hospital with the new coronavirus.\nJohnson’s office says he is being admitted for tests because he still has symptoms, 10 days after testing positive for the virus.\nDowning St. says the hospitalization is a “precautionary step” and he remains in charge of the government.\nJohnson, 55, has been quarantined in his Downing St. residence since being diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 26.\n___\nNEW YORK — A tiger at the Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the new coronavirus, in what is believed to be the first known infection in an animal in the U.S. or a tiger anywhere, federal officials and the zoo said Sunday.\nThe 4-year-old Malayan tiger, and six other tigers and lions that have also fallen ill, are believed to have been infected by a zoo employee, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. The first animal started showing symptoms March 27, and all are expected to recover, said the zoo, which has been closed to the public since March 16.\nThe finding raises new questions about transmission of the virus in animals. The USDA says there are no known cases of the virus in U.S. pets or livestock.\nThe coronavirus outbreaks around the world are driven by person-to-person transmission, experts say.\nThere have been reports of a small number of pets outside the United States becoming infected after close contact with contagious people, including a Hong Kong dog that tested positive for a low level of the pathogen in February and early March. Hong Kong agriculture authorities concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn’t pass the virus to human beings but could test positive if exposed by their owners.\n___\nBoeing said it will continue its shutdown of production indefinitely at its Seattle-area facilities because of the spread of the coronavirus.\nThe company in an email to Washington employees said it is extending the planned two-week shutdown rather than reopening Wednesday. The decision affects about 30,000 of Boeing’s 70,000 employees in the state.\nThe company said the decision is based on the health and safety of its employees, assessment of the coronavirus spread, supply chain concerns and recommendations from government health officials.\n___\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, who was the first congressman to test positive for coronavirus, announced on Twitter that he is now virus free.\n“Today, after being deemed #COVID19 free by my doctor, I was able to reunite with my family in Miami. Though still a bit weak, I feel well, & I applied to participate in the @RedCross plasma donation to help those with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections.”\n___\nNEW ORLEANS — The city’s Catholic population struggled to celebrate Palm Sunday at a time when the city’s churches have stopped holding services under the state’s stay-at-home mandate.\nThat has meant finding creative ways for pastors to meet the spiritual needs of their parishioners. Rev. Emmanuel Mulenga is the pastor at Saint Augustine Catholic Church, a nearly 200-year-old church in the city’s historically African American Treme neighborhood.\nOn Palm Sunday, the church would normally have a special ceremony to commemorate Jesus’s entry into Jerusalem. This Sunday, he still gave out palm fronds to parishioners who wanted them while still adhering to social distancing guidelines. He blessed the fronds and put them on a table near the back of the church where people could easily spot them when they came in the back door.\nAbout 50 to 60 parishioners turned out, Mulenga said.\n“Despite the social distancing ... the spiritual aspects of our lives, faith, still continues, and I personally believe that under the present circumstances we need those personal connections and prayer even more,” he said.\n___\nThe company 3M said it is working with German authorities to determine whether an incorrect report of one of its mask shipments being diverted to the United States was due to fraud.\nBerlin authorities had said last week that a shipment of 200,000 masks intended for Berlin police had been seized in Thailand en route from China.\nIn a statement Sunday, 3M said it had no record of an order for Berlin police and has offered to help governments verify the authenticity of any offers to sell protective masks, which are used to prevent the spread of coronavirus to health workers and others.\n___\nLouisiana health officials reported 68 coronavirus-related deaths on Sunday, marking the state’s biggest jump in reported deaths since the outbreak began.\nThe Louisiana Department of Health reported the figures on its website Sunday. The number of infections reported to the state also increased by more than 500 cases from 12,496 to 13,010.\nBefore Sunday, the largest number of deaths reported in a single day was 60. The numbers represent when the tests were reported to the state, not necessarily when the infections or deaths occurred.\nLouisiana and the New Orleans area have been an epicenter for the virus, and Gov. John Bel Edwards has repeatedly warned of looming shortages for ventilators and intensive care units.\n___\nWASHINGTON — The District of Columbia has announced 96 more positive infections from the COVID-19 coronavirus, bringing the total up to 998, with 22 deaths.\nMayor Muriel Bowser has issued a stay-home order for Washington’s approximately 700,000 residents. Neighboring Maryland and Virginia have done the same. Bowser has declared a state of emergency, shuttered all schools and ordered all non-essential businesses to close. White House and Capitol tours have been cancelled and the National Zoo, Smithsonian museum network and Kennedy Center have closed.\n___\nANNAPOLIS, Md. — Gov. Larry Hogan announced new mandates for Maryland’s nursing homes in order to dull the spread of COVID-19, which has invaded dozens of facilities in the state.\nUnder the threat of criminal penalties, Hogan’s order and directive from his health secretary demand that nursing home employees in close contact with residents wear facemasks, gloves, gowns and other personal protective gear when providing care.\nNursing homes must have expedited testing for the new coronavirus and designated areas where residents with known or suspected COVID-19 are treated, according to the new rules.\nViolating the rules is a misdemeanor punishable by fines and prison.\nHogan said more than 80 nursing homes and long-term care facilities have positive cases or clusters of cases. The most intense cluster is at the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, where four more residents diagnosed with COVID-19 have now died, bringing the total to nine, health officials announced this weekend. More than 100 residents or staff have tested positive there.\nThe Maryland health department issued guidance nearly four weeks ago to restrict resident visitations and control infections.\n___\nATLANTA — One of the daughters of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. will help lead a new outreach committee in Georgia as the state copes with the coronavirus, Gov. Brian Kemp announced.\nBernice King, CEO of The King Center, will co-chair the committee with Engaged Futures Group LLC President Leo Smith, Kemp said. More than a dozen other members, including business and nonprofit leaders, make up the committee.\nOfficials did not immediately release additional details about what the committee will do.\nGeorgia has seen more than 200 deaths in the state and more than 1,200 have been hospitalized. Total infections confirmed in the state exceed 6,600.\n___\nSIOUX FALLS, S.D. — The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Dakota rose to 240 Sunday as President Donald Trump declared a major disaster for the state.\nTrump’s order directs federal assistance to supplement state, tribal and local recovery efforts in areas hit by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe South Dakota Department of Health reported 28 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus Sunday. That number does not include tests pending in private labs or those who are not being tested.\nMinnehaha County reports 23 new positive tests, bringing the total number of cases in South Dakota’s most populous county to 104. Eighteen of those patients in Minnehaha County have recovered.\n___\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The ACLU says it is seeking an injunction to block part of Puerto Rico’s strict curfew against the new coronavirus and argues that some of its restrictions are unconstitutional.\nThe curfew imposed March 15 has shuttered non-essential businesses in the U.S. territory and ordered people to stay home from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. and remain there even outside those hours unless they have to buy food or medicine, go to the bank or have an emergency or health-related situation.\nViolators face a $5,000 fine or a six-month jail term, and police have cited hundreds of people. A spokesman for the U.S. territory’s Justice Department said Sunday there was no immediate comment.\nIt is the first time the ACLU has decided to file a lawsuit in a U.S. jurisdiction related to a coronavirus curfew.\n___\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper has issued new requirements for those visiting or working on Department of Defense installations regarding the use of cloth face coverings.\nEsper says that “to the extent practical,” all individuals on DOD property “will wear” the face coverings when they cannot maintain 6 feet of social distance from others.\nThe guidance is effective immediately. It follows a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that encourages people, especially in areas hit hard by the spread of the coronavirus, to use rudimentary coverings such as T-shirts, bandannas and non-medical masks to cover their faces while outdoors.\nEsper outlined the new requirements in a memorandum to senior military leaders Sunday.\nEsper said the requirement doesn’t apply to a service member’s personal residence on a military installation. But it does apply to work centers and other public areas.\nHe says exceptions may be approved by local commanders or supervisors and then submitted up the chain of command for awareness.\n___\nPARIS — France reported 357 deaths in hospitals from the virus in a single day Sunday but showed signs that its spread is slowing after 20 days of national confinement.\nThe country remains among the hardest hit in the world, with 8,078 confirmed deaths since the virus arrived in January. More than a quarter of those who died were in nursing homes, according to figures from the national health service Sunday night.\nFrance’s intensive care units continue to fill up fast, with 390 new arrivals since Saturday for a total of 6,978 people in critical care beds. But the daily growth has been slowing, and 250 people left intensive care in the same one-day period. Most of those in intensive care are older, but 106 are under 30 years old.\nWhile still high, the number of new deaths in hospitals dropped Sunday for the second day straight and was the lowest since March 29.\nFrance continued Sunday to transport critically ill patients out of saturated regions to those with more hospital space and has brought in hundreds of medical personnel to help in the overwhelmed Paris region.\n___\nWASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci says there a very good chance the new coronavirus “will assume a seasonal nature” because it is unlikely to be under control globally.\nFauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He says the virus is unlikely to be completely eradicated from the planet this year. That means the U.S. could see the “beginning of a resurgence” during the next flu season.\nFauci says the prospect of a resurgence is the reason the U.S. is working so hard to get its preparedness “better than it was.” He says that includes working to develop a vaccine and conducting clinical trials on therapeutic interventions.\nFauci also says states that don’t have stay-at-home orders are not putting the rest of the country at risk as much as they are putting themselves at risk.\nFauci spoke on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”\n___\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — Some Kentucky churches held Palm Sunday services in defiance of Gov. Andy Beshear’s warning against in-person worship.\nDozens of people were at Maryville Baptist Church in Louisville on Sunday, news outlets reported. A video showed a pianist playing and choir members singing during the late morning service.\nLouisville’s Our Savior Lutheran Church streamed its in-person service live on YouTube. The church had required online registration beforehand and restricted seating to every other pew. The video stream did not show the audience.\nBeshear warned during his daily briefing on Saturday that mass gatherings “are spreading the coronavirus.\n“We care about each other in this state, and our faith guides us and gives us the wisdom to do the right thing to protect each other.”\nSome states, including Florida, have made exemptions to allow religious gatherings to proceed during the coronavirus. Kentucky does not have that exemption.\n___\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2020/03/21/if-covid-19-takes-hold-in-india-the-toll-will-be-grim", "title": "The billion - person question - If covid - 19 takes hold in India the toll will be grim | Asia", "text": "IT WAS CALLED the Spanish influenza, but given the number of Indians it killed, the flu pandemic of 1918-19 should perhaps have carried a different name. Some 18m are thought to have died, or 6% of the country’s population at the time. A century later, with covid-19 lapping at India’s now far more crowded shores, fears are rising that the world’s second-most-populous country could again bear a disproportionate share of the global agony.\nUntil now, India has been lucky with this coronavirus. Despite the proximity of China there is only modest human traffic between the Asian giants, a result of chronically strained relations. Nor do many travellers visit India from other early centres of the pandemic, such as Iran and Italy. Partly as a result, India has registered fewer than 200 cases so far, and only three deaths. Most of those testing positive acquired the virus outside the country.\nIndian governments, both central and state, have also been strikingly forceful in their response. They were quick to restrict travel from afflicted areas and apply basic screening at airports. India has also airlifted—and closely monitored the health of—hundreds of its own citizens from stricken spots such as Wuhan, Tehran and Milan. Public information campaigns have saturated every television channel; recorded messages even interrupt calls on India’s 900m mobile phones. Across most states, schools and universities have been shut and public events cancelled. Kerala in the far south, a state with a record of excellence in public health, has gone further. Volunteers now deliver free school lunches directly to homes, while kerbside basins have been installed at even the remotest rural bus stations to encourage hand-washing. To enforce adherence to individual isolation orders, health authorities farther north in Maharashtra are stamping hands in indelible ink with the word “Home Quarantined” and an expiry date.\nHealth officials insist that they have managed to limit infections to people who were exposed to the virus abroad and their immediate contacts within India. In some places, they have been assiduous in finding and isolating those at risk. One case in Kerala, where success in stemming an outbreak of the far deadlier Nipah virus in 2018 has built institutional expertise, involved tracing nearly 1,000 people who had come in contact with a single family. But not all states are as efficient. Border screening varied between entry points and never amounted to more than taking the temperatures of passengers—a dragnet a covid-carrier could slip through by taking paracetamol, a doctor grumbles.\nMany also note the paucity of testing data. Due to the cost and relatively small supply of testing kits, plus the limited capacity of government labs and a commendable desire to control the complex testing process so that it does not itself become a vector for the virus, India has so far only tested some 11,500 people. This compares with 270,000 in South Korea, a country with a fraction of the population. And because the testing protocol has focused so heavily on travellers, it has become what one expert calls a self-fulfilling prophecy, detecting only cases with foreign origins. “I suspect that if we did 20 times more tests we might find 20 times more cases,” says Ramanan Laxminarayan of Princeton University. “I personally think we are already in the thousands if not tens of thousands.”\nShould the virus have indeed slipped past India’s barriers, there is little reason to think it will follow a different course from elsewhere. That would put India’s epidemic about two weeks behind America’s and perhaps a month behind Italy’s. That is alarming, given how poorly prepared India is. Decades of under-investment in public health—recent budgets have averaged a meagre 1.3% of GDP—have left it with a thin and creaky system (see chart). There are not enough doctors, not enough beds and not enough equipment for the country’s 1.3bn people, even in ordinary times. Moreover, these scant resources are unevenly distributed. Excellent private hospitals and prestigious public medical schools mean that big cities such as Delhi and Mumbai may be reasonably served. But in 2017 some 63 children suffering from encephalitis died when the oxygen supply ran out at a state-run hospital in Gorakhpur, a drab provincial city near the border with Nepal. India’s 100,000-odd intensive-care beds, which cater to perhaps 5m people a year, could be faced with that many in a month.\nThe public is not well prepared either, particularly for a disease that primarily afflicts the lungs, and is more severe in patients with pre-existing conditions. The prevalence of both extreme air pollution and drug-resistant tuberculosis do not bode well. Indians also account for an estimated 49% of the world’s diabetics. Widespread poverty not only exacerbates such diseases, it makes it practically impossible for many Indians to leave jobs or to work at home. All too often, anyway, those homes are too tiny and crowded to allow for “social distancing”. In many cases there is not even any way to wash properly: some 160m Indians do not have access to clean water.\nThe potential for a dire outcome is glaring. Yet as Mr Laxminarayan notes, India has a talent for pulling together for colossal “non-routine” events, such as massive weddings and political rallies. Others hope that the novel coronavirus will take a battering from the looming and ferocious summer heat. (That is true of some other ailments, but may not be for covid-19).\nOn the streets, meanwhile, it is common to hear the whimsical opinion that Indians are already so toughened by hardship that this virus won’t hurt them. Then, for the truly fervent, there are magic cures. At a recent event in Delhi, members of a fringe cult celebrated the curative properties of cow urine. “It should be served to all tourists on arrival to cure them, for the protection of India,” enthuses Rajeev Kumar of the All-India Hindu Mahasabha, a Hindu nationalist group. “We are even sending a little pack to President Trump, to keep him safe from corona!” ■\nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus hub\nThis article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline \"The billion-person question\""}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/02/coronavirus-could-hit-american-workers-especially-hard/607213/", "title": "Coronavirus Could Hit American Workers Especially Hard", "text": "As the coronavirus that has sickened tens of thousands in China spreads worldwide, it now seems like a virtual inevitability that millions of Americans are going to be infected with the flu-like illness known as COVID-19. Public-health officials in the United States have started preparing for what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is calling a “significant disruption” to daily life. Because more than 80 percent of cases are mild and many will show no symptoms at all, limiting the disease’s spread rests on the basics of prevention: Wash your hands well and frequently, cover your mouth when you cough, and stay home if you feel ill. But that last thing might prove to be among the biggest Achilles’ heels in efforts to stymie the spread of COVID-19. The culture of the American workplace puts everyone’s health at unnecessary risk.\nFor all but the independently wealthy in America, the best-case scenario for getting sick is being a person with good health insurance, paid time off, and a reasonable boss who won’t penalize you for taking a few sick days or working from home. For millions of the country’s workers, such a scenario is a nearly inconceivable luxury. “With more than a third of Americans in jobs that offer no sick leave at all, many unfortunately cannot afford to take any days off when they are feeling sick,” Robyn Gershon, an epidemiology professor at the NYU School of Global Public Health, wrote in an email. “People who do not (or cannot) stay home when ill do present a risk to others.” On this count, the United States is a global anomaly, one of only a handful of countries that doesn’t guarantee its workers paid leave of any kind. These jobs are also the kind least likely to supply workers with health insurance, making it difficult for millions of people to get medical proof that they can’t go to work."}, {"url": "https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/fridays_papersairport_troubles_struggling_poor_and_love_in_the_time_of_corona/11278556", "title": "Friday papers :  Airport troubles , struggling poor , and love in the time of corona", "text": "Friday's papers: Airport troubles, struggling poor, and love in the time of corona\nToday's press examines risky airport congestion, the epidemic and the vulnerable, and socially-distant wedding vows.\nNewsstand tabloid Ilta-Sanomat’s top story collates criticisms towards the government’s handling of Finland’s coronavirus epidemic, particularly in regard to Finns returning from abroad.\nPotential carriers of the virus have been standing in long queues at the airport before thronging into packed airport buses, according to IS.\nThe article suggests that communication between airport operator Finavia, Finnish health watchdog THL and government ministries has been lacking. An Yle poll published on Thursday, however, indicates high approval ratings for the president's and PM's handling of the epidemic.\nCoronavirus and poverty\nAround the world, coronavirus is compounding risks that disadvantaged groups already face. The epidemic’s effect on people’s lives depends partly on income.\nHS visited a food bank in Helsinki’s Kontula suburb on Wednesday, where many of those in line belonged to risk groups, but didn’t keep a safe distance from one another. The food bank serves 150-200 customers daily.\n“When your own life is full of problems, such as money and health, it’s difficult to become too concerned about this kind of big news story,” Anne Hietalahti of the Deaconess Foundation told HS.\nExacerbating the situation is the fact that many day centres supporting recovering addicts and those coping with mental illness have closed after the government banned gatherings of more than ten people.\nFood pantries are also recognising deteriorating economic conditions brought on by coronavirus. A nursing student in the queue said the epidemic wiped out her job, bringing her income down to a 250-euro monthly student subsidy.\n“It’s not enough to survive on. I come here a few times a week with my spouse. One bag lasts us several days,” she said.\nLove in the time of corona\nWhat’s it like to get married in the middle of an epidemic? HS followed one couple to the altar at Helsinki’s Lutheran Cathedral, where the pastor kept a two-metre distance to Petra and Marco Syväntö when they said, \"I do.\"\nThe pair downsized their wedding to a few family members in an empty church and skipped their reception.\n“We didn’t want coronavirus to stop us from getting married.

As the covid-19 disease spreads, and efforts to halt it threaten to cause a cash crunch, they could be part of the solution. Company revenues may tumble but firms will still need to cover wages, leases and loans. Workers—especially temporary or gig ones—may not be paid, but mortgage or rent payments and credit-card bills will pile up. The banks (maybe backed by the government) will need to plug the gap.\nOrdinarily, such stresses would indicate insolvency and banks would attempt to collect. But this crisis is different. There is a reasonable expectation that the cash crunch will be temporary. When activity resumes payments can once again start flowing.\nAmerica has recently endured a small-scale version of such a cashflow crisis. From December 22nd 2018 the government was shut down for 35 days, resulting in delays to the wage payments of 800,000 federal employees. According to Prudential, an insurance company, half of the federal employees it surveyed missed bill payments, like utilities or phone bills, and a quarter missed making a mortgage payment.\nMany banks at the time acted to minimise financial hardship, by agreeing to delays in mortgage payments, waiving credit-card interest and overdraft fees, allowing early access to fixed-term deposits and offering low- or no-interest short-term financing to some customers. There were some long-term effects, like lower credit scores, but few major ones.\nIf such measures are required for a longer period, the pressures on banks to lend or offer forbearance might clash with post-crisis regulatory restrictions. Big banks already report seeing “flight to quality” deposits pouring in. But leverage ratios constrain bank balance-sheets. More deposits might induce banks to cut back on other activities.\nNo one is served by defaults on the part of borrowers who would have been solvent but for the epidemic. The question for banks, their customers and their regulators is how these can be avoided.\nThis article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline \"When the bucks stop\""}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-us-press-office/2020/apr/27/guardian-us-launches-guardian-gives-back-to-support-no-kid-hungry", "title": "Guardian US launches Guardian Gives Back to support No Kid Hungry", "text": "Guardian US launches Guardian Gives Back to support No Kid Hungry\nGuardian US today launched Guardian Gives Back, a program that will contribute at least $100,000 in value to No Kid Hungry by donating 10% of revenue generated from advertising partnerships, combined with media value.

The first large-scale study of the epidemic, released by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on February 18th, reports that the trend in new cases has peaked and is starting to fall. It argues that “isolation of whole cities, broadcast of critical information (eg, promoting hand washing, mask wearing, and care seeking) with high frequency through multiple channels, and mobilisation of a multi-sector rapid-response teams is helping to curb the epidemic.” That said, the authors also warn that, as draconian controls are eased and people return to work, the country “needs to prepare for the possible rebound of the epidemic”.\nChina likes to point out that, when the H1N1 flu virus was first identified in America in 2009 (and later found to have originated in Mexico), the country proved unable to stop a global pandemic that killed perhaps 284,000 people. Yet for all the chest-beating about the virtues of Chinese socialism, an analysis by The Economist finds that democracies—defined here as countries with free and fair elections—tend to be better than other forms of government at containing and treating outbreaks of disease. This holds true for rich and poor countries alike.\nUsing data from the International Disaster Database, maintained by researchers at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, we analysed all recorded epidemics since 1960, from an outbreak of smallpox in Nepal in 1963 to more recent threats such as Zika and Ebola. The results were highly dispersed but a distinct trend was apparent: for any given level of income, democracies appear to experience lower mortality rates for epidemic diseases than their non-democratic counterparts (see chart). In authoritarian countries with China’s level of income, for example, we found that past epidemics have killed about six people per 1m population. In democracies with similar incomes, they have killed just four per 1m.\nThe difference between democracies and non-democracies is statistically highly significant. The relationship also appears to be robust: it holds when considering only large epidemics (more than 50 deaths), or only epidemics affecting populations in the same geographical region. It also holds when controlling for the year or decade in which the epidemics occurred.\nIt may seem surprising that democracies, with their notoriously messy bottom-up processes, outperform their authoritarian alternatives on this measure. Urgent health concerns demand urgent action, something not normally associated with deliberative democracy. In Norway, one of the most democratic countries in the world, lawmakers have been debating the location of a new 200-bed hospital for seven years. In China, a new 1,000-bed hospital to treat coronavirus patients was recently built in just ten days.\nBut authoritarian regimes, although able to co-ordinate massive construction projects, may be poorly suited to matters that require the free flow of information and open dialogue between citizens and rulers. During an outbreak, for example, constructive feedback about how government policies are working can help guide a more dynamic response. Non-democratic societies often restrict the flow of information and persecute perceived critics.\nTake Li Wenliang. In December Dr Li, a 33-year-old ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, privately warned his fellow doctors about the appearance of a SARS-like disease. Instead of listening to his concerns, Chinese police are said to have rebuked the doctor for “making false comments”. Dr Li was later rehabilitated. By then, though, he had become infected. Covid-19 ultimately killed him.\nOr take Quishi, a Communist Party magazine. It recently reported that Xi Jinping, the president, had known of the outbreak early on and gave instructions for action to be taken on January 7th—a fortnight before the outbreak was announced. The aim may have been to portray Mr Xi as being in command of events. But it also highlighted the fact that the Chinese leadership is poor at passing on vital, life-saving information to the public."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-51632690/iran-s-minister-appears-unwell-before-positive-coronavirus-test", "title": "Iran minister appears unwell before positive coronavirus test", "text": "Iran's minister appears unwell before positive coronavirus test\nIranian Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi mopped his brow repeatedly at a televised news conference on Monday, a day before he tested positive for the new coronavirus disease.\nThe official death toll from the Covid-19 outbreak in Iran has risen to 15, while 95 cases have been confirmed.\n- 25 Feb 2020"}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/05/covid-19-and-xenophobia-why-outbreaks-are-often-accompanied-by-racism", "title": "COVID - 19 and xenophobia : Why outbreaks are often accompanied by racism", "text": "The outbreak of the coronavirus COVID-19 has had many side effects. While the World Health Organisation and other agencies are trying to transparently distribute accurate information about the disease, the global conversation has been dominated by mass hysteria and global panic.\nTo protect themselves, people are washing their hands like it is the latest fashion trend and have collected stockpiles of hand sanitiser. Conspiracy theories are going viral on the internet. Protective facemasks are flying off the shelves in pharmacies worldwide.\nFinancial markets are crashing and Corona beer sales have declined. The travel industry is devastated, and some news media outlets have succumbed to fearmongering and blatantly misleading headlines.\nBut one of the most devastating side effects has been xenophobic attacks against people of Asian descent.\nXenophobic attacks and actions\nSince COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, some people have started calling it the “China-virus.” This label along with racist assumptions centred around Chinese people’s supposed appetite for bat labelled as something that people “don’t eat in the normal world,” have caused a spate of racist attacks globally.\nThere has been similar disgust for the market the virus is supposed to have originated from even though scientists say it might not be that after all.\nClearly, the virus does not respect Chinese borders and new centres of infections have developed in Iran and Italy.\nNevertheless, it is mainly people of Asian descent who are on the receiving end of aggression.\nThe attacks can take the form of microaggressions, such as people refusing to sit next to passengers of Asian descent on metros and buses or moving up their scarves to cover their faces.\nOn social media, there are several reports of verbal attacks, such as in this case in Italy, where a Japanese opera singer was, according to her account, \"evaded in Milan, made terrible gestures on the train, and directly ranted at.\"\nIn Germany, Sinophobic attacks have also increased.\nIn one of the most recent cases a Singaporean student was attacked in London. Jonathan Mok had posted pictures of his bruised face on Facebook with an account of his assault.\nMok said one of the people tried to kick him in the head and told him: “I don’t want your coronavirus in my country.”\nThe student was beaten so badly that doctors advised that he may have to go through reconstructive surgery for his face. Police are now looking for the attackers with the help of CCTV footage.\nIn some places across Thailand, South Korea, Vietnam and Italy signs have been put up forbidding Chinese people from entering restaurants and shops.\nIn the US, the University of California, Berkeley, published an Instagram post, listing xenophobia as a common reaction to the outbreak.\nThe post immediately caused a strong backlash, was quickly taken down, and the university apologised for it.\nOn social media, many users were quick to point out that such reactions would not have been the case if the virus had originated in Europe.\nIndeed, xenophobia against Americans was not one of the reactions when the N1H1 virus was first detected in the USA in 2009.\nHealth institutions try to educate\nTo combat the stigma and xenophobia surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, health institutions have put out statements.\nDuring a press conference on March 2, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom said: “It’s so painful to see the level of stigma we’re observing.”\nIn his speech, he called for people to “fight in unison,” adding that the stigma “to be honest, is more dangerous than the virus itself. [...] Stigma is the most dangerous enemy.”\nBoth, the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have put out information pamphlets that aim to fight the stigma against people of Asian descent.\nThe CDC website states that “diseases can make anyone sick regardless of their race or ethnicity.” It adds that “people of Asian descent, [...] are not more likely to get COVID-19.”\nThe WHO writes that “stigmatisation could contribute to more severe health problems, ongoing transmission, and difficulties controlling infectious diseases during an epidemic.”\nThe organisation points out that stigma can:\n- Drive people to hide the illness to avoid discrimination\n- Prevent people from seeking health care immediately\n- Discourage people from adopting healthy behaviours\nThey advise people to spread the facts to counter misinformation and amplify voices of those who have had and recovered from COVID-19.\nMoreover, media organisations are called upon to offer balanced reporting and portray different ethnic groups, instead of only showing pictures of Chinatowns and Asian people with facemasks.\nOn March 4, the Instagram account Diet Prada called out the New York Times, which had posted an article about the first case of COVID-19 in New York State.\nThe woman had likely become infected on a trip to Iran. Yet, the paper had used a picture of Chinatown and Asian people with face masks for its article. The picture was quickly swapped out with a generic picture of New York traffic without comment.\nEuronews has reached out to the New York Times for comment.\n#ImNotaVirus, #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus #nosoyunvirus\nDespite the seriousness of the attacks, many people of Asian descent have chosen to make the best of their situation by taking a humorous approach.\nAmerican actor, director and producer Michael Tow published a video making fun of people’s reaction when they are close to a coughing Asian.\nMeanwhile the hashtag #imnotavirus has gone viral on social media. The campaign was launched by Chinese communities and features Asian people everywhere taking a stance against xenophobia.\nPanic exposes deep-seated xenophobia against Asian people\nXenophobia in response to outbreaks is not a new occurrence. Yet, the current outbreak has caused many commentators to suggest that Asians are feeling the brunt of it.\nMerlin Chowkwayun, a historian and assistant professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health told Vox: “In general, when there is a zeitgeist of racial backlash and xenophobia, it drips down into medical discourse. Given the tensions between the [US] and China now, it’s not surprising to see that happening with coronavirus.”\n'Yellow Peril'\nIn the 19th century, Europeans feared a so-called “Yellow Peril” brought about by “primitive people with emerging global power.\nThe words “Yellow Peril” were a metaphor for a notion that the peoples of East Asia were an existential danger to the Western World. It was a form of xenophobia and fear of the non-white other from the orient. Fear of 'the Other'.\nBut even before that time, both the plague and cholera used to be associated with Asia. In 1899, during the bubonic plague outbreak, C. B. Wood, a board of health member for the then-territory of Hawaii, wrote: “Plague lives and breeds in filth, and when it got to Chinatown, it found its natural habitat.”\nHeidi A. Morefield, a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Global Health Program at the Woodrow Wilson School Center for Health and Wellbeing told Euronews, there is a “long history of xenophobia following outbreaks—from lepers being cast out of settlements in the Middle Ages to the stigmatisation of certain groups associated with syphilis in the Early Modern period, to more recent examples like Jim Crow quarantines, fears of immigrants in the US since the Progressive Era, and the colonial notion that indigenous populations were reservoirs of disease dangerous to white people.”\nShe adds, “the “reason\" comes down to fear of the unknown and of the “Other,” which was encouraged by systemic racism.”\nIn fact, our health regulations today originated during colonial times. “There were long debates over quarantine in the second half of the nineteenth century, when European colonialism was at its peak because they were so economically costly,” Morefield notes.\nThe International Sanitary Conventions took place between 1851 and 1938. They were a series of 14 conferences aimed at standardising international quarantine regulations against the spread of cholera, plague and yellow fever.\nDuring those conferences, politicians and health experts debated the best way to control disease, “particularly cholera which was thought to have come to Europe from Asia - given that people didn’t yet fully understand whether or which diseases were contagious or how they spread,” Morefield points out.\nThose conferences and their outcome played a major role in the formation of the World Health Organization (WHO).\nMorefield adds that “people often reach for the most convenient target to blame, and in this case, since the first reported cases came from China, there has been a backlash against anyone presenting as Chinese or East Asian.”\nHowever, xenophobic reactions are not only targeted against Asian people. Depending on the origin of the disease, people of African background were also often the target, as could be seen following the Ebola outbreak.\nThere was similar stigma towards gay people, Haitians and later Africans during the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n“Again, these types of xenophobic stigmas date back centuries, if not millennia—they go hand in hand with outbreaks,” Morefield stresses.\nLessons learned\nThe best way to counteract xenophobia is to work together, history shows. Morefield advises for common sense, such as following basic public health advice, washing your hands, staying home if you are symptomatic and contacting relevant authorities for testing.\nShe also points out that “transparent and comprehensive messaging from government authorities goes a long way to quelling fear that often motivates racist attacks during outbreaks. The way both the Chinese and American governments have handled this crisis so far has led to a lot of mistrust from the public.”\nFinally, the rules for dealing with the outbreak of disease are simple: Viruses don’t respect borders. So just wash your hands and don't point the finger."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/82e7d8b255fb72df9da773d1ff42d63c", "title": "The Latest : Disneyland in Shanghai will reopen May 11", "text": "The Latest: Russia’s minister of culture tests positive\nThe Latest on the coronavirus pandemic.

Serbia has recorded more than 9,600 COVID-19 cases and 200 deaths.\nExperts have warned a quick lifting of the nearly two-month lockdown measures and easing of other restrictions could trigger a second wave of infections.\nSome European Union officials and Serbia’s opposition and rights groups have criticized President Aleksandar Vucic for sidelining parliament when introducing the state of emergency and allegedly assumed full power during the pandemic.\nHis opponents have banged pots and pans from their balconies each night in Belgrade and other cities.

While migrants are not testing positive in great numbers, they have seen their precarious, off-the-books work dry up because of Italy’s lockdown.\nFrancis said Wednesday at the end of his general audience that migrant workers in Italy are “very harshly exploited.”\nHe said: “It is true that the current crisis affects everyone, but people’s dignity must always be respected. ... May the crisis give us the opportunity to make the dignity of the person and of work the center of our concern.”\nFarm lobby groups and some Italian ministers have warned that spring and summer harvests are at risk because Italy’s usual seasonal workers, many of whom live in Eastern Europe, are stuck at home because of virus travel restrictions.\nItaly’s agriculture minister, from the center-left Italy of Values party, has proposed legalizing them, backed by the interior minister and minister for the south who also wants to legalize Italy’s army of foreign domestic workers who care for the elderly at home. But the majority 5-Star Movement is divided on the issue.\n___\nJAKARTA, Indonesia — The Indonesian government was expected to allow all commercial transportation operations for the public on Thursday.\nThis public transportation service had previously been closed in the areas who implemented the large-scale social restrictions and areas that are classified as the ‘red zone’ areas following the prohibition of returning home to celebrate the end of Ramadan.\n“The plan of the operation will start on May 7. But it is restricted to people who want to return to their hometown,” Indonesian Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi said on Wednesday.\nAccording to Sumadi, there are several criteria for the passengers who are allowed to use transportation services, including people with essential business needs and the officers that are working on security and defense services.\nThe National Task Force for the Acceleration of COVID-19 Mitigation emphasized that passengers should follow health protocols, such as providing the health document from the clinics or hospitals, using a mask, applying physical distancing and showing the trip schedule with the departing and returning tickets.\nThe government reported over 12,000 virus cases with almost 900 deaths as of Wednesday. It says more than 2,300 people have recovered.\n___\nJOHANNESBURG — The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Africa has shot up 42% in the week ending Tuesday, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.\nThe number of cases is expected to surpass 50,000 later Wednesday, and the number of deaths could top 2,000. All but one of Africa’s 54 countries, tiny Lesotho, has reported virus cases.\nThe World Health Organization has warned that Africa could become the next epicenter of the pandemic. Severe shortages of testing kits mean the number of actual cases across the continent is unknown.\nIn Somalia, aid groups are warning that the number of virus cases is far higher than the 835 reported. The country has one of the world’s weakest health systems. Twelve African nations now have more than 1,000 confirmed cases.\n___\nBRUSSELS — The European Union predicted Wednesday “a recession of historic proportions this year” due to the impact of the coronavirus with a drop in output of more than 7%, as it released its first official forecast of the damage the pandemic is inflicting on the bloc’s economy.\nThe 27-nation EU economy is predicted to contract by 7.5% this year, before growing by about 6% in 2021. The group of 19 nations using the euro as their currency will see a record decline of 7.75% this year, and grow by 6.25% in 2021, the European Commission said in its Spring economic forecast.\nMore than 1.1 million people have contracted the virus across Europe and over 137,000 have died, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Unclear outbreak data, low testing rates and the strain on health care systems mean the true scale of the pandemic is much greater.\nHow quickly things can change. On Feb. 13, the commission had predicted “a path of steady, moderate growth” this year and next of 1.2%. At that time, uncertainty over U.S. trade policy and a Brexit trade deal plus tensions in Latin America and the Middle East were the main threats.\nThe coronavirus outbreak in China was noted at the time as “a new downside risk” but the commission’s assumption less than three months ago was “that the outbreak peaks in the first quarter, with relatively limited global spillovers.”\n___\nMOSCOW — Russia has reported more than 10,500 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, bringing the national total over 165,000, including about 1,500 deaths.\nThe country’s health officials have been reporting more than 10,000 new cases for the fourth day in a row. The caseload is likely to be much higher as not everyone is being tested, and many people infected with the virus don’t show any symptoms.\nRussia has been in lockdown since late March, with the vast majority of regions requiring residents to stay at home and suspending operation of most businesses. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin extended the lockdown till May 11.\n___\nPARIS — France’s government is warning the French that they shouldn’t expect to travel far for their vacations this summer because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nJean-Baptiste Lemoyne, a deputy minister at the French Foreign Ministry, said Wednesday that the external borders of Europe’s visa-free Schengen area, incorporating 26 nations, will remain closed “for several weeks, for several months.”\nHe said that for summer vacationers, “a trip of several thousand kilometers (miles) is, for sure, excluded.”\nThe comments are the latest warning from the French government that vacationers need to scale back their expectations this summer. The government is advising people to vacation in France instead, in part to help the tourism sector battered by the pandemic.\n___\nSTOCKHOLM — Swedish media say that the Scandinavian country’s tax authorities have, under the current laws, ordered medical staff to pay taxes for the free lunches they have been getting. Or donors to report their gifts to the taxman.\nThe southern Sweden daily Sydsvenskan says three restaurants in Lund, one of the region’s largest cities, have offered free lunches.\n“It feels saddening,” Asa Loven, co-owner of the Stamstallet eatery in Lund, told the daily.\nIn Sweden, if an employer receives lunches for the employees, it should be reported as a taxable benefit, the Swedish Tax Agency told Sydsvenska.\nIn Goteborg, Sweden’s second largest city, a restaurant donated food to healthcare professionals directly to health staff. However, the state agency said the giving part should report it, as it is taxable, the local newspaper Goteborgs-Posten wrote.\nYngve Gripple, a spokesman at the Swedish Tax Agency, told Goteborgs-Posten that the legislature needed to be changed if free lunches should not be taxed.\n___\nPRAGUE — A comprehensive study in the Czech Republic to determine the undetected infections with the coronavirus in the population has revealed a low number of COVID-19 cases.\nHealth Minister Adam Vojtech said a total of 26,549 people were tested across the country, including the capital, with 107 previously undetected positive tests.\nThe study was conducted in different parts of the Czech Republic where the epidemic was at different stages on people aged 18-89. In the capital of Prague and the second largest city of Brno, children also were included.\nThe samples of the population included volunteers as well selected groups, such as those suffering from chronic diseases.\nA significant number of people infected with the coronavirus suffer no or only mild symptoms, but there is concern that they might unwittingly spread the virus to others.\nSome 7,900 people have been tested positive in the Czech Republic, according to Health Ministry figures released on Wednesday, 258 have died.\n___\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Long-haul carrier Qatar Airways says it will lay off staff as the coronavirus pandemic largely has grounded the global aviation industry.\nThe Doha-based carrier in a statement on Wednesday offered no figures for the number of employees who will be fired.\nQatar Airways is one of the three major airlines in the Persian Gulf region created to capitalize on East-West travel. It began flying in 1994 and has a fleet of over 200 aircraft that it flies out of Doha’s recently built Hamad International Airport.\nHowever, an emailed memo from the airline’s CEO that leaked online said the layoffs number would be “substantial” and include members of its cabin crew.\n___\nBERLIN — German Chancellor Angela Merkel is meeting Wednesday with the governors of the country’s 16 states to discuss further loosening restrictions imposed to curb the coronavirus pandemic.\nWith the number of new cases in Germany averaging around 1,000 in recent days, pressure to relax the rules further has grown.

The official, Dr. Rick Bright, led the Department of Health and Human Services’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and alleged Wednesday that he was ousted from that role for demanding rigorous testing of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug President Trump has suggested as a potential treatment of Covid-19.\nWhen asked about the demotion Thursday, Trump denied knowing who Dr. Bright was or anything about him.\n“I’m not sure what’s more depressing — that our president demoted a doctor who’s trying to prevent Americans from trying an ineffective drug that could kill us or that we’re not even remotely surprised that he did.” — JIMMY KIMMEL\n“That’s right. Trump has never heard of the guy in charge of finding a vaccine. And you know what? To be honest, part of me is not surprised. [imitating Trump aide] ‘Sir, would you like to meet the scientist who is in charge of finding a vaccine?” [imitating Trump] A scientist? Ew, gross. I’d rather meet Eric.’” — TREVOR NOAH\n“And here’s my only question about Trump: Why does he never hear of the people trying to solve problems, but people who are trying to cause problems? [as Trump] Hello, Giuliani? Yeah, some guy has the cure in his lab. I need you to go in there and do your Tasmanian devil thing.” — TREVOR NOAH\n“I don’t understand how Trump has never heard of the person in charge of finding the vaccine to the disease that has shut down the entire world — and don’t tell me it’s because he’s too busy. I mean, this is the same man — the same man who says he’s been watching every nightly news show plus CNN, MSNBC in the morning, Fox News on weekend afternoons, and even reruns of baseball. Reruns! Let me tell you something: If you have time to watch reruns of baseball, you have time for anything. Baseball is boring when it’s happening. Watching it in reruns is like watching paint dry through a PowerPoint presentation.” — TREVOR NOAH\n“That’s right, Trump fired a guy named ‘Dr. Bright.’ He also let go of Professor Smarty, Dr. Savior and Secretary ‘I Have the Cure, Don’t Fire Me.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT\n“[as Trump] Hey, look, my ideas don’t lack scientific merit — they lack any merit. You ready for another idea? Boof some Listerine. Couldn’t hurt. I mean, it stings, but that’s how you know it’s working.” — STEPHEN COLBERT\nThe Punchiest Punchlines (Coronavirus: Fall Edition)\n“On Tuesday, Dr. Redfield told The Washington Post that ‘there’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through.’ And if you don’t remember how difficult this past winter was, it had Trump’s acquittal, the Australian bush fires, and ‘Cats: the Movie.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT discussing Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n“And the idea of corona and flu hitting us simultaneously is terrifying, because that means we’re going to have to do double social distancing, we’re going to wear two masks, we’re gonna have to stay 12 feet away from people, we’re going to have to watch celebrities sing ‘Imagine’ twice.” — TREVOR NOAH\n“These poor doctors working for Trump. If they don’t give us the truth, they’re not doing their jobs, but if they do tell the truth, there’s a good chance he’ll fire them, so their only option is to play dumb and hope Trump gets distracted by a Filet-O-Fish or something.“ — JIMMY KIMMEL\n“So we just better pray that coronavirus is cured by pumpkin spice.” — STEPHEN COLBERT\nThe Bits Worth Watching\nInspired by Stanley Tucci, Roy Wood Jr. offers the recipe for a new quarantine cocktail.\nAlso, Check This Out\nHospitals are playing songs of hope for discharged Covid-19 patients on their way home, and selections include Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’” and the theme song from “Rocky.”"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/china/2020/02/22/amid-a-virus-lockdown-how-are-chinas-migrant-workers-surviving", "title": "Chaguan - Amid a virus lockdown , how are China migrant workers surviving ? | China", "text": "“FAMILY IS HAPPINESS,” reads the motto over the front door of a village house in the north-west of Sichuan province. From the mahjong table beneath a velvet dust-cloth, to the child-sized chair facing a television flanked by pink plastic speakers, all is ready for a family reunion. The home’s owners, grandparents in their 50s, have had six weeks to clean and tidy, their longest break in years from lives of toil in Beijing. Alas, the couple did not choose this extended holiday, nor the loss of pay it involves. In common with many of China’s 173m long-distance migrant workers, their jobs have been halted by the new coronavirus. Worse, during this subdued lunar new year they have not seen their only child, a 32-year-old chef. Curbs on travel have left him stuck in the next-door province of Shaanxi with his wife and eight-year-old son.\nIn medical terms, covid-19 has largely spared this corner of Sichuan. As The Economist went to press there were 22 confirmed cases and no deaths in the nearest large city, Mianyang, and in the villages that surround it, with their fir trees and duck ponds and fields of yellow rapeseed. Still, quarantine restrictions have shut down bus services. Villages are closed behind checkpoints guarded by local officials and volunteers in masks and red armbands, wielding digital thermometers and disinfectant sprays.\nChina is a country of half-idled factories, of office towers emptied of white-collar staff, and restaurants without diners. Chaguan this week travelled to Sichuan, 1,700km south-west of Beijing, to meet a few of the blue-collar workers who are suffering the consequences. He found people who are at once more resilient and more vulnerable than their peers in the rich world. Migrants hunkered down in home villages talk of picking free vegetables, or bartering with neighbours. Less happily, meat prices are high. Pork prices have soared since herds were devastated by African swine fever, an animal pandemic that reached China in 2018. None of those who spoke to Chaguan questioned strict government controls, for the virus scares them. Neither they nor their village are named here. These are jumpy times in which Communist Party leaders have demanded that news reports should be filled with “positive energy”.\nChaguan chatted with workers on plastic stools outside a three-storey home built in 2008 at a cost of about 120,000 yuan ($17,130). It sits on land owned by a 54-year-old grandfather who works in Beijing as a casual painter and decorator. He is paid 3,000 yuan in a good month. His wife, also 54, cleans an insurance company’s offices, earning about two-thirds of that. Their combined earnings make them middle-income workers in China, but they watch every yuan. They rent a room in a shared apartment for a little over 1,000 yuan a month. They make packed lunches and take buses to work. The wife explains that, with underground train tickets starting at three yuan, “If I take the metro I won’t have any money left.” They have lived in Beijing since 2004 but have barely explored the city, apart from a visit to the Great Wall and another to see Mao Zedong in his mausoleum.\nEach morning now, they check for a smartphone message from the cleaning firm that employs the wife, telling her to return to Beijing. As out-of-town arrivals to the capital they will have to spend two weeks in self-isolation, or face legal penalties. Loneliness does not worry them. “Quarantine isn’t that different from what we usually do, we just stay put,” shrugs the husband. Money is more of a concern, for he will earn nothing while isolated. In a good month the couple save just over 1,000 yuan after rent and living expenses. For years, their savings went towards building their house, which they will leave to their son. Now they regularly send money to help fund their grandson’s studies in Mianyang. “We have to. That’s how it is in the countryside,” says the wife.\nChinese savings rates are high by world standards—even the poor routinely save 20% of their disposable income. In contrast, a study in 2017 by America’s Federal Reserve found that 44% of Americans lack the savings to pay an unexpected $400 bill. China’s skimpy pensions and health insurance, notably in rural areas, explain much of that thrift. Westerners are helped with lots of costs, says a young man visiting the village from Mianyang. “Chinese people, we’re on our own,” he laughs. Life under lockdown is cheaper here than usual because social visits are banned. Every three households have been given a ticket, allowing one person to buy supplies for them all from the local market. For now, the grandparents who normally work in Beijing are spending savings. They could survive another half a year, they think, but no more.\nNeeded but seldom heeded\nA sense of powerlessness can hurt as much as dwindling funds. A visit to Mianyang’s almost-deserted railway station found a middle-aged couple heading, unhappily, back to Zhejiang province, where infection rates are rather high. They both work in Jiaxing, near Shanghai, at a factory that makes linings for much-needed face-masks, and so have been ordered to return. They do not know if they will be paid for the two-week quarantine that awaits them, which they have heard will be monitored via the GPS function on their phones. They do not even know whether their landlord will let them back into the room that they rent from him. Reports abound of migrants being denied entry to residential compounds, as local officials and property managers impose harsh rules, some of their own invention. If they are barred from their home the factory has offered dormitory beds, says the wife. “There is no option. We have to go back,” sighs the husband.\nIn truth, China’s economy needs migrant labour just as much as those workers need their pay. Hard, solitary lives explain why the average age of such workers is now over 40. The young often prefer to work nearer home. Though covid-19 would test any country, the epidemic is casting fresh light on a Chinese society divided by cruel inequalities of wealth, political clout and urban versus rural class. This is a crisis with many sorts of victim. ■\nRead more of our coverage of the covid-19 outbreak:\nExperts predict that covid-19 will spread more widely (February 22nd)\nIn China, newly confirmed cases of coronavirus infection are falling (February 20th)\nCovid-19 presents economic policymakers with a new sort of threat (February 20th)\nHow China’s coronavirus epidemic could hurt the world economy (February 13th)\nThis article appeared in the China section of the print edition under the headline \"Putting faces to the numbers\""}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/business/nestle-and-loreal-cancel-all-international-business-trips-tbmwtvdr3", "title": "Nestlé and LOréal cancel all international business trips | Business", "text": "Nestlé and L’Oréal cancel all international business trips\nNestlé and L’Oréal are among leading consumer groups that have told hundreds of thousands of staff to avoid travelling for business reasons as a precautionary response to the coronavirus.\nNestlé, the Swiss multinational behind Nescafé, KitKat and Milkybar, instructed employees to halt all international travel until March 15, in one of the largest corporate reactions to the Covid-19 outbreak.

Her confirmed diagnosis came after her death, he said. The woman, a resident of Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo, was the mother-in-law of a taxi driver who also became a newly confirmed case, Japanese media reported. Health Ministry officials declined to confirm a relationship at the request of her family.\nOfficials also confirmed two other cases, a doctor in his 50s who works at a hospital in western Japan and a man in his 20s who lives in Chiba, near Tokyo. None had a record of traveling abroad in recent weeks or contacts with Chinese — a possible sign that the virus is spreading inside the country.\nEarlier Thursday, he announced 44 new cases on the Diamond Princess, which is still carrying nearly 3,500 passengers and crew members. The ship now has 218 people infected with the virus out of 713 tested since it entered Yokohama Port on Feb. 3, the largest cluster of infections outside China.\nIn all, Japan has 250 confirmed cases of the new disease that apparently started in Wuhan, a city in central China, in December.\nChina has reported 1,367 deaths among 52,526 cases on the mainland. Two other locations outside the mainland, Hong Kong and the Philippines, have recorded one death each.\nKato said five of the patients sent to hospitals earlier have severe symptoms and are on artificial respirators or under intensive care.\nThe government has decided to allow passengers older than 80 to get off the ship after testing negative for the virus, Kato said. He said results of tests on about 200 eligible passengers are underway, and those with chronic health problems or in cabins without operable windows will be given priority.\nKato said the measure is to reduce health risks for passengers stuck in rooms under difficult conditions. Those who are released will be asked to stay at a designated facility through the end of the quarantine period.\n“We are doing our utmost for the health of crew members and passengers who remain on the ship,” Kato told a news conference.\nSome experts have questioned Japan’s strategy of isolating the passengers and crew in a potentially virus-affected environment on the ship while the disease is already slowly making its way into the country.\n“On the ship, infections are getting very dense. ... It now provides a favorable environment for the virus to spread and I think it’s time for people to get off,” said Shigeru Omi, an infectious disease prevention expert and former regional director for the World Health Organization. “It’s like we are seeing a very condensed version of what could happen in a local community.”\nOmi, who currently heads the Japan Community Health Care Organization, said those people who have tested positive for the virus are “only a fraction” of what could already be spreading outside of the ship. “We should assume that the virus has already been spreading in Japan,” he said.\nLater Thursday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced a 15.3 billion yen ($139 million) economic package to fight the virus, including funding for the development of vaccines and virus test kits, support for hundreds of returnees from Wuhan and measures to strengthen border controls to minimize the spread of the virus in the country.\n___\nAssociated Press journalist Richard Colombo contributed to this report.\n___\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi"}, {"url": "https://www.dw.com/en/prime-minister-johnson-tests-positive-for-covid-19/av-52945708", "title": "Prime Minister Johnson tests positive for Covid - 19 | DW News - latest news and breaking stories | DW", "text": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wasn’t too concerned about the spread of the corona virus only a few weeks ago.

Health Board Deputy Director General Jelena Tomasova said on Vikerraadio's \"Uudis+\" on Wednesday that the Health Board and the Health Insurance Fund were in talks to work out the funding of a similar solution, which would allow employees to work from home or stay home with children being kept home from school for the same two-week period.\nThe Health Insurance Fund refuted this claim on Thursday, however, confirming to ERR that no such talks have been held between the two bodies, nor is the Ministry of Social Affairs aware of such.\nThe Health Insurance Fund's recommendation follows the Health Board's guidelines: if an individual has returned from an affected area and has doubts about the state of their own health, but is not displaying any symptoms, they should contact their employer and reach an agreement regarding staying home or, if possible, working from home.

Though it is possible that garlic may have some antimicrobial properties, there is no evidence to suggest from the current coronavirus outbreak that eating this bulb will protect people from the virus.\nCan pets spread COVID-19?\nThere is no evidence to suggest pets, such as cats and dogs, can be infected or transmit the coronavirus.

Due to the poor survivability of the coronavirus on surfaces, there is a very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks.\nIs there a vaccine yet?\nThe new coronavirus needs its own vaccine. Pneumonia vaccines such as the pneumococcal and the Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine will not protect you against the coronavirus.\nDo bleach products protect you?\nBleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, solvents, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform can kill the 2019-nCoV on hard surfaces; however, they have little or no impact if you put them on your skin.\nAvoid direct contact!\nTo avoid a coronavirus infection, always cook raw foods thoroughly. It is also advisable to avoid direct contact with people who are sick.\nKeep your hands clean!\nFrequently washing your hands with soap and water can help prevent an infection. You can also use an alcohol-based sanitizing gel instead. If you have to cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow.

This was a distant thought just one month ago. Now, as cases climb, we are braced for impact.\nAs the crisis deepens in the world’s largest economies, taking up most of the media bandwidth, Africa hardly makes the headlines. In international news outlets, the idea of crisis in Africa is met with resignation, not outrage. It is almost as if the media perceives crisis as the status quo in Africa, something expected. Unavoidable.\nKenya’s cabinet secretary for health, Mutahi Kagwe, has cautioned: “We are praying and hoping for the best, but clearly we must also prepare for the worst. And mentally we must prepare ourselves to face an insurmountable situation.”\nTo date, only a handful of countries have successfully “flattened the curve”, controlling the outbreak so that it doesn’t overwhelm their healthcare system. We now know this is possible, and what it will take. So we must ask ourselves – what more can be done to strengthen prevention and readiness efforts where coronavirus has yet to take hold? We must do more as a global community to ensure the third wave is not the deadliest and most destructive.\nIf we don’t act now, communities such as mine are where Covid will cause the most destruction and even chaos. I grew up in Kibera, Africa’s biggest slum, on the outskirts of Kenya’s capital city. Like all cities, Nairobi is a fluid urban centre where people are interconnected through jobs, mass transit, daily life, but here approximately 60% of the population are living in an urban slum.\nKibera, like all slums, is a transitory place where people come and go between their families’ ancestral village and the promise of economic opportunity in urban centres. Raised in a 10-by-10 shanty room with seven siblings, we had no concept of personal space or time alone. Hygiene was poor, our toilet was shared by more than 50 households.\nToday, despite all our efforts, thousands of Kibera’s families live in the same circumstances alongside poor sanitation. With up to 250,000 of the world’s poorest people living on 2.5 sq km of land, there is no way to practise “two-metre social distancing”. in Kibera and among the world’s one billion slum dwellers, our best bet is to try to prevent an outbreak; we know this is virtually impossible but it’s our only hope and we have to try. In a pandemic such as this, the fate of urban slums will impact the trajectory of the Covid-19 virus on a national scale.\nThe head of the World Health Organization (WHO,) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that Africa must wake up to the coronavirus. Vulnerable communities like mine are heeding this call, working around the clock, scraping together resources to do everything they can to keep the virus out. It is time for international leaders to step in with support that can reinforce community-led efforts. Even modest investments such as cash payments to slum dwellers and improving awareness, testing efforts and food support would go a long way towards containing and slowing the spread. As I write, there have only been 197 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Kenya with eight deaths but where will we be in a month’s time, if the virus spreads the way it has in the developed world?\nIn Kibera and other slums across Kenya, communities are taking matters into their own hands because when a community comes together even in the most fearful times there is hope. Community leaders are mobilising through Shofco, an organisation I founded as a 15-year-old boy who believed in the potential for communities to change their destiny. Together we have set up handwashing stations at every entry point to the slum and are running door-to-door campaigns to raise awareness and distribute bleach, homemade soap and hand sanitiser while combating rumours and misinformation.\nIn partnership with the government, ministry of health and other locally based organisations, we are doing all we can to prevent the outbreak from decimating some of our most vulnerable communities. We know that if and when we face the full force of the virus, our fate is intertwined with one another, our city and our nation as a whole. This is a fact that we will never forget.\nThe fear in my community is palpable. Joan, a resident of Kibera, says: “When I hear of corona I see death has come to Kibera, it’s a disease that spreads quickly and hurts. Because of our living conditions, it will spread fast. Many of our people have underlying conditions like HIV, blood pressure, there are orphans without good nutrition and very poor families. They say corona kills those with poor immunity, so we will all be at risk of a quick, sudden death.”\nWe have seen the alarm bells sounding around the globe. It is my plea that the international community seizes this opportunity to strengthen a successful homegrown effort that can teach valuable lessons in preparedness, rather than waiting to mobilise only after massive devastation has taken place.\nFrom Kibera, from communities like mine, i hope the world learns that we are capable of keeping ourselves safe, clean, safe and protected. Community-led efforts must be allowed to start and to lead the way.\n• Kennedy Odede is CEO and founder of the charity Shining Hope for Communities (Shofco)"}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/when-disease-comes-leaders-grab-more-power/608560/", "title": "When Disease Comes , Rulers Grab More Power", "text": "On March 13—Friday the 13th, as it happened—my husband was driving down a Polish highway when he turned on the news and learned that the country’s borders would shut down in 24 hours. He pulled over and called me. I bought a ticket from London to Warsaw minutes later. I don’t live there all of the time, but my husband is Polish, the only house I own is in rural Poland, and I wanted to be in it. The next morning, Heathrow Airport was spookily empty except for the Warsaw flight, which was packed with people trying to get one of the last commercial trips back into their country. During check-in, agents were refusing to board passengers without a Polish passport (I have one) or residency documents. Then someone realized that the new rules went into effect only at midnight, and so I witnessed a conversation between one of the stewards and two non-Polish passengers: “You realize that you might not be able to fly out again. You realize that you may be in Warsaw for a very long time …”\nThat same day, we called our college-freshman son in the United States and told him to get to the airport. He had been planning to stay with friends and family after his university closed. Instead, we gave him 30 minutes’ notice to get on one of the last flights to London, connecting to one of the last flights to Berlin. By the time he landed in Europe on Sunday, Poland had shut its borders to all public transportation. He took a train from Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder, a town at the Polish-German border. Then he got out and walked across, carrying his luggage, as if in a Cold War movie about a spy exchange. He saw roadblocks, soldiers with guns, men in hazmat suits taking temperatures. My husband picked him up on the other side."}]
