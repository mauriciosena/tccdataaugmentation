Can you give any numbers?\nIt is now difficult to anticipate the exact impact of the virus on the economy of China and the United States in numbers. We do not know how long this public health crisis will last, but there is no doubt that the two economies will be severely affected.\nGiven the interconnected nature of the modern global economy and the fact that all major economies are suffering from this epidemic, the prospects for a speedy recovery are very mysterious. It will take at least several years to stabilize the global economy.\nInitially, the European Union did not help its partners fight the Corona virus, and China and Russia came to help. How will this affect the future of the European Union and international politics?\nIndeed, the unity of the European Union has been put into question, as requests for assistance from its members have not been heard, and officials have admitted and apologized to Italy for the delay. This opened the door for China and Russia, which allowed them to play the role that other European Union members should have played.\nOf course, Britain's exit from the European Union dealt a heavy blow to the Union. Consequently, as an international institution, it may undergo some important changes in the near future. Meanwhile, China's influence in Europe, especially in eastern and southern Europe, will continue to grow. As a result, the power structure in Europe will change radically, as will the relationship between the European Union and China.\nThe article only expresses the opinion of the newspaper or the writer\nStudy reveals the most deadly type of cancer in patients with COVID-19\nMao Zedong rid China of the Corona virus\nBeijing announces the expulsion of an American destroyer from its territorial waters\nThe President of Brazil admits that he is unable to face Coruna, after he underestimated his outbreak"}, {"url": "https://www.kachaf.com/details.php?n=5e8957fe1cd0fa0cce184225", "title": "", "text": "Fatal error: Uncaught MongoDB\\Driver\\Exception\\ConnectionTimeoutException: No suitable servers found (`serverSelectionTryOnce` set): [connection refused calling ismaster on '127.0.0.1:27017'] in /var/www/html/kachaf/php/vendor/mongodb/mongodb/src/Collection.php:645\nStack trace:\n#0 /var/www/html/kachaf/php/vendor/mongodb/mongodb/src/Collection.php(645): MongoDB\\Driver\\Manager->selectServer(Object(MongoDB\\Driver\\ReadPreference))\n#1 /var/www/html/kachaf/php/scripts/getter.php(105): MongoDB\\Collection->findOne(Array)\n#2 /var/www/html/kachaf/public/details.php(10): getter->findbyid('5e8957fe1cd0fa0...', 'news')\n#3 {main}\nthrown in/var/www/html/kachaf/php/vendor/mongodb/mongodb/src/Collection.phpon line645"}, {"url": "http://www.almayadeen.net/news/politics/1377820/%D9%88%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B9-%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%82%D8%AA-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7---%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%81", "title": "Suspicious facts accompanied Corona ... Who knew?", "text": "Suspicious facts accompanied Corona ... Who knew?\nThe official American prediction of a pandemic before it occurred raised a range of questions and speculation about the extent of the threat to the biological weapons program and its threat to the lives and welfare of large numbers of people.\nThe rapid spread and diversification of infectious epidemics globally since the beginning of the third millennium imposes a number of questions about the truth of their scientific roots, in the first place, and the political and strategic dimensions of all mankind from the directions of countries producing arsenals of biological weapons, led by the United States.\nOn these days in January 2012, an international conference convened by the United Nations in Geneva to develop mechanisms for monitoring biological weapons failed, in which the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, made a speech encouraging efforts to protect humanity from the specter of biological weapons; but she strongly rejected International restrictions to ensure the safety of the world.\nJohn Bolton preceded him in his official position as Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, 2001, by rejecting the investigation system that the United Nations reached after exhausting years of negotiations, in whole and in detail, saying that \"the United States will simply not enter into agreements that would allow For rogue states or others to develop and deploy biological weapons. \"\nThree countries are internationally \"trusted\" to implement the Biological Weapons Convention concluded in 1975 with the signing of 165 countries: Russia, Britain and the United States to receive complaints and suggest solutions.\nAmong the scientific complaints received by the \"Big Three,\" December 9, 2001, was a briefing by the American human rights organization Ithaca to the Seventh International Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention. It contained the United States' violation of the treaty due to its involvement in an activity related to the development of an offensive biological weapons program They are stored in Sierra Army Depots, in northern California and possibly in other regions. \"\nIt is noteworthy that the then US administration introduced \"Article 817\" to the articles of the Patriot Act, 2001, and it allows the government to develop and store biological weapons and their release systems without restrictions, that is, practically canceling the texts of the international agreement signed on it.\nWhat is striking and disturbing is what was \"foretold\" by the then Deputy Minister of Homeland Security, Daniel Gerstein, addressing the aforementioned international conference, 2012, that his country \"expects a pandemic by the end of 2013\". The diagnosis was shared by Dr. Joseph Kim at the Enuvio Vaccine Production Company.\nThe official American prediction of a pandemic before it occurred raised a range of questions and speculation about the dangerous extent of the biological weapons program and its threat to the lives and welfare of large numbers of people.\nThe Hollywood community accompanied it with the production of a movie called Contagion in 2011, which revolves around a pandemic caused by bats, according to the prepared scenario, which is currently taking place with the Corona epidemic in China, which is likely to be the source of the virus in Wuhan Province.\nIn the context of the American \"prediction\", China was exposed in 2013 to a massive wave of \"bird flu - H7N9\", as it immediately began to exterminate millions of chicken birds, and this not only left negative repercussions on its economy, but at the global level to ban trade and dealing with Beijing. We are seeing it happening again these days.\nOn January 31, the US government announced its implementation of \"new measures to counter the Corona virus, including preventing Chinese citizens from entering its territory\"; and applying quarantine to individuals coming from there.\n“In 1971, Cuba was the first country in the Caribbean to announce its exposure to a dengue (dengue) epidemic, and it is believed to originate in Spain.” This was the summary of a medical bulletin issued by prestigious US health institutes in 2009. Cuba, in turn, accused the US government of spreading the epidemic Its animal wealth from pigs and it was forced to exterminate half a million heads.\nScientifically, the Corona virus infects the human respiratory system, which is similar to the previous SARS epidemic - acute pneumonia - and the origins of the two strains are from animals and have been transmitted to humans, and then to its human brother; , Due to its appearance and spread in Saudi Arabia in 2012, causing severe pneumonia to the patient.\nSome experts in the field of biological sciences suggest that the US government will engage in \"designing a biological attack against China for geopolitical considerations\", coinciding with the spread of \"the new epidemic and danger\" with the Chinese New Year celebrations to paralyze Chinese society, a large majority of whom will use transportation to return to their original villages.\nProfessor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, Richard Iberat, expressed to the Washington Post his doubts about the American source because \"the genome of the virus and its properties do not indicate that it is the kind produced in vitro\".\nThe newspaper and US circles have been charged with developing China for developing biological weapons in the Wuhan facility for a year, for \"engaging in espionage activities to obtain biological components.\"\nIt was recorded earlier this week that a federal court directed an indictment against Harvard professor Charles Lieber and \"two people of Chinese nationality for their attempts to smuggle 21 tubes inside of biological material into China\", and Lieber receives a monthly reward of $ 50,000 from Wuhan Technical University, according to the indictment .\nWhat strengthens the hypotheses of the American source of the virus is the Trump administration’s policy of fighting China by all means, starting with trade wars, and also exposing it to a series of “deadly bacterial attacks and viral diseases, and symptoms targeting both livestock and humans.”\nThe Epidemiologist at the Rand Institute, Jennifer Bowie, confirmed the close link between the two epidemics (SARS and Corona) as \"the compatibility ratio between them is at least 70% of genetic material and transmission mechanisms. The mortality rate for those with SARS is about 10%, compared to 3\" % For Corona virus \".\nBoi praised the transparency of scientists and the Chinese government, and the \"sharing of the international scientific edifice with the genome data of the virus,\" and reached them to know the causes within a short period of time, not exceeding a few days, which will contribute to developing an effective vaccine soon.\nThe American epidemiologist, Dina Grayson, expressed concern about a set of facts surrounding the Corona virus, especially from the high speed of its spread from one person to another \"It is not only contagious, but kills the infected.\" Grayson has long experience in developing drugs to treat the Ebola epidemic.\nIt is worth noting that Corona virus is a US product with distinction, according to the registry of invention submitted in 2015, which was approved in 2018.\nIn the same context, there are \"separate\" strange incidents that targeted China originating in North America; the most prominent of which was the shipment arrival of a source from Canadian biological laboratories, in March 2019, which included \"malicious viruses,\" which the Canadians claimed was \"part of the research efforts to support public health research.\" In the world.\" It is worth noting that this shipment was carried out under the veil of secrecy, in contrast to the usual procedures, which prompted the Chinese side to file a formal complaint in this regard.\nA large US military delegation, consisting of 300 people, arrives in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China on October 19, 2019, to participate in a military games festival hosted by China and held there. On November 2, 2019, the first infection with the Corona virus was recorded in that province, and it later spread rapidly in December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days.\nThe cost of what China has been exposed to as a result of the epidemic is prohibitive by all measures: disruption of flights and the movement of trains and other transportation at the height of its largest and most important annual holidays; and the stricken Wuhan municipality imposed a ban on leaving the town on the population “only for emergency reasons; Everyday life and tremendous business exchanges with the world.\nUltimately, who can answer the question about who benefits from all this can reach the heart of the matter: waging wars with biological weapons at a lower cost than nuclear engagement."}, {"url": "https://az.sputniknews.ru/video/20200318/423441625/konets-globalizma-gosudarstvennye-granitsy-zakryty-iz-za-koronavirusa.html", "title": "The End of Globalism: Country Borders Closed Due to Coronavirus", "text": "At the end of 2019, PRC authorities announced an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province.

In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.\nIs the virus a biological weapon?\nA former member of the United Nations Commission on Biological Weapons, Igor Nikulin, believes that the emergence of this virus could be the result of the use of an American biological weapon. He mentioned the scandal in 2010, when one of the 400 American military biological laboratories deployed around the world was closed in Indonesia because it was conducting secret experiments with the bird flu virus. When the virus emerged from the laboratory and a serious pandemic began, the United States refused to provide information about its work to the Indonesian Ministry of Health.\nHealth officials around the world are racing to control the virus, which first appeared last month, similar to the SARS virus, and the World Health Organization is expected to announce later today whether the spread of the new disease warrants a declaration of an emergency, which relates to complex cross-border epidemics.\nThe vaccine against the virus\nIn less than a week, virologists from the Novosibirsk State Scientific Center \"Viktor\" developed a diagnostic test system for Corona virus, which would allow detection of the virus at an early stage of the disease.\nBut it is too early to talk about the development of a vaccine. State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin has asked the State Duma Health Protection Committee to prepare anti-virus measures in the country.\nAmong the measures taken, all travelers arriving from Southeast Asia are examined by thermal imaging at the airports. Hospitals in the Amur region are on high alert. Likewise, preventive measures are being taken across the country - especially in large transport centers. In particular, quarantine control at checkpoints at state borders has been strengthened, and the epidemiological situation is monitored daily.\nThe Russian Consumer Protection Agency, \"Ross Potter Nadzor\" said that the specialists of the \"Victor\" Center within the organization have devised tools for the laboratory diagnosis of the new disease.\nScientists from Novosibirsk developed two independent diagnostic groups, dependent on the method used in molecular biology and the chain polymerase reaction. Using one of these methods, the 2019-nCoV virus can be detected at an early stage, and the second is used to diagnose another serious disease that humanity has encountered before is SARS. The polymerase chain reaction method is very sensitive: it can even detect individual copies of viruses in only 2-4 hours. For this, a small swab of the nasopharynx is sufficient. Thus, rapid diagnosis can be made immediately in the laboratories of the Russian Epidemiology Centers of the Russian Consumer Protection Agency located throughout the country.\nIt is reported that \"Victor\" one of the largest scientific centers in virology and biotechnology in Russia and the world. Here, one of the first test systems was developed to diagnose HIV and hepatitis B, immunostimulating drug \"Ridustine\" and many other unique medicines.\n\"It is impossible to develop a vaccine within a week, and the evaluation of efficacy also needs time. This is the seventh version of the Corona virus known to humanity since 1965,\" Gennady Onishchenko told the Tsargrad website. Our country is using a vaccine against it yet, and we must understand that different viral diseases require total or regional vaccination only in the event of a disease. In this case, there is no such need. ”\nHe added that Wuhan is not far from us, the city is closer than it seems to many. Here we talk about an acute respiratory infection that is easy to transmit.

The recent spat of moderate candidates dropping out (Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Bloomberg, Steyer) alongside Elizabeth Warren’s decision to stay in for Super Tuesday (and dropping out right after) boosted Biden into the lead in delegate count, but it is unclear going forward whether he will be able to gain ground or maintain his advantage.\nHis campaign is essentially a redux of Hillary Clinton’s in 2016, a dystopian offering of neoliberal establishment ideas: essentially the most harmful, bland, out-of-touch, uninspiring, and ignorant set of centrist policies. Biden offers nothing new, substantial, or exciting; and he himself stated to donors last year that “nothing would fundamentally change” under his presidency. By continuing to go with “moderate”, centrist agendas, the Democratic Party establishment, corporate America, and mainstream media reveal they would rather lose to Trump than get behind the progressive choice, Bernie Sanders.\nSupport for Bernie Sanders is strong across all national polling, yet in past debates, his moderate rivals continued to shoot themselves in the foot by offering up the most ridiculous arguments against progressive causes. Regardless of his success, Biden has learned nothing and absorbed no lessons from his fellow moderates’ failures or the excitement and promise offered by the progressive wing of his party. He is a living fossil. Like his corporate-backed counterpart moderates, his whole shtick is based on presenting himself as the lesser of two evils, offering the most milquetoast set of policies, and attempting to make voters fearful of Sanders’ incremental reforms by casting them as socialist and authoritarian.\nBy representing Sanders’ social democratic policies as “dangerous” as well as his supporters as being rude on social media because they actually care and are passionate about changing the direction of this country, the centrist hydra of campaign rhetoric and establishment media devolved into offering an infantile, McCarthyite debating style.\nMuch like the centrist triad of Biden, Buttigieg (who suspended his campaign March 1st), and Klobuchar (also suspended March 2nd), who are equal parts sell-outs, windbags, and sycophantic brown-nosers to the ruling class, the professional class choice, technocrat, pseudo-progressive Elizabeth Warren as well as what I’d call the “Silicon Valley candidate” Andrew Yang also represent the epitome of “big-brained centrist” thought.\nBasically, this term represents the attitude of mainstream liberal as well as conservative candidates, commentators, and their supporters who believe they truly understand the world better than anyone else due to what they consider their meritocratic success, and use all sorts of neoliberal fallacies, deliver paeans to pragmatism and bipartisanship, mock social democratic reforms with calls to be “reasonable”, and generally act as puppets of corporate and imperial power. Of course, it should be obvious that those who harp on achieving “realistic goals” are those that view anything involving a transformation of society involving redistribution of wealth from the rich to the working classes asprima facieunrealistic.\nAs for Steyer and Bloomberg, they too fall prey to neoliberal notions of rugged individualism; i.e., that their economic success is due to their own “hard work”, and were so completely out of touch that they cannot realize the electorate is not prepared to substitute one billionaire for another, no matter what party they represent, or what good they claim they’ve been able to accomplish in their philanthropic endeavors.\nAll of the candidates, except for Bernie Sanders, completely debased themselves when asked if the candidate with the most delegates should get the Democratic nomination. That’s how democracy is supposed to work, right? The person with the most votes should win, no? Not if you want to suck up to the ruling class, who are deathly afraid of Sanders’ redistributive agenda.\nClimbing corporate and political hierarchies as well as the fake meritocracy in this country inflates politicians’ egos and warped the ability to self-reflect on their own abilities and intelligence. In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger Effect, defined as: “a cognitive bias in which people wrongly overestimate their knowledge or ability in a specific area. This tends to occur because a lack of self-awareness prevents them from accurately assessing their skills.”\nTerrifyingly, one of the consequences of this effect is that many of the afflicted exude rare confidence due to their overestimation of their skills that can be mistaken for dedication, passion, expertise, and conviction. While truly intelligent people constantly question and doubt their own ideas and preconceived notions, lesser intellects rigidly cling to dogmas in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. This was summed up best by Yeats, when he wrote: “The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.”\nIn politics and social relations, this effect is compounded because the awareness of the suffering of others is blunted the higher you go on the socio-economic scale. The effect of ascending political hierarchies is not much different in a capitalist economy, because the higher you go the more beholden you are to elite interests. As studies have shown, Emotional Intelligence (EQ) declines significantly the higher you look on the corporate ladder. CEOs and business owners tend to have more sociopathic, narcissistic, and psychopathic traits.\nThis is why it is so hard to change the minds of the privileged and affluent: it is not simply a matter of intellect and rational argumentation to help bring change to another’s belief system. If only logical persuasion worked that effectively! One must also help cultivate awareness, a sense of interconnectedness with the less fortunate, the environment and the universe, and a way to empathize with poor, vulnerable, and minority communities. One can prove empirically over and over how a socialist economy, universal healthcare, and a society of free association of producers would significantly improve the lives of people around the world. Those in denial still won’t believe you, because their self-awareness and sense of empathy for the poor, dispossessed, and vulnerable has atrophied.\nIt is at this stage in history that the nihilism of rich liberals and conservatives as well as the professional-managerial class reaches truly epic proportions, threatening the survival of humanity and most species on the planet. The real material conditions and problems of working people are abstracted as inequality rises. The obvious cause of the immiseration of the population and the devastation of the environment, capitalism, is obscured. Conservatives and republicans are even more delusional due to their slavish devotion to the status quo and political and economic hierarchies, as well as their mythical belief that the capitalist “free market” can solve all manner of problems. Further, conservatives view any government intervention to regulate corporate monopoly power and lessen environmental degradation as an infringement on their rights, or inane arguments that sensible environmental regulation will hurt the economy are used.\nThe only option left for moderate liberals is to succumb to the dystopian vision of neoliberal thought which dominates center-left and center-right thinking, because it is all-pervasive. Even mild progressives who stray even a bit to the left (such as Warren) are instantly and predictably vilified by the press, by billionaires who literally cry in public in protestation of her wealth tax. This leads the opportunistic and ambitious (Warren, just like Obama before her) to tack to the center in order to secure donors to stay in politics and keep their jobs.\nThe moderate candidates know their ideas are viewed as trash by a significant amount of voters, so identity politics, as well as rhetoric and euphemisms about “structural change” are predictably trotted out. Neoliberal is now a dirty word, so liberal politicians deflect as much as possible and claim their policies are “pragmatic” and are willing to work across the aisle and compromise, in contrast to the “uncompromising” style of Sanders. These are the big-brained centrists, who let their ruling class donors do all their thinking for them as to what constitutes an acceptable and “realistic” policy.\nBig-brain centrism is also a term to describe a type of neoliberal wonkery which emphasizes that only technocratic policy, which echoes the Third Way of Blair and Clinton, a centrism in which the patina of “progressivism”, economic “pragmatism”, and the appearance of caring for marginalized groups dominates. Increased political representation of minorities is a wonderful thing, but the moderate democrats will never grow a spine and ask for economic redistribution from billionaires to poor people of color. Only “moderates” can deliver the best model for liberal democracy, and everyone to their left, even the mild-mannered reformism of Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is an “extremist” or a “populist”. Of course, this hodge-podge of power-hungry politicians, clueless think-tank sycophants, and conniving corporate vampires are totally beholden to elite interests, as they represent a class of smug affluent liberals and republicans who pray to the Almighty Dollar.\nThe big-brained liberals are hypnotized by the concept of bipartisanship, which is what Obama tried and failed to do for eight years. For the centrists, the idea that the two-party system is become more polarized is an unmitigated disaster, leaving only “far-left” politics in fashion (we wish!) alongside far-right politics (accurate). True progress can only be made “in the middle”, what some like to call “radical centrism” and politicians should not pander to their constituents with “empty promises” and “populist rhetoric.” What this radical centrism misses is the rightward shift in economics and federal policy which has been underway for 40+ years, and the consequent shift in the Overton Window: the range of ideas that are considered acceptable in US politics. In the 1960s, for instance, Sanders’ reformism would have been seen as standard, middle-of-the-road liberal set of policies, rather than today, where social democratic agendas induce shrieking from rich know-nothings and talking heads who insist that Bernie is an authoritarian communist.\nIn this Beltway bubble-world, Sanders is simply the converse of Trump, a dangerous left-wing populist, who, in words of Buttigieg, “wants to burn this party down.” What Sanders simply wants is to bring the US into the 21st century by adopting the social democratic policies of Scandinavia and most European nations. Yet, this is unacceptable to the “realistic” and “electability” thought-police. Big brain centrism is what it would look like to put Thomas Friedman and David Brooks in a room together and let them try to come up with federal policies. Their policies and worldview probably would not look very different from some of the ideas and concepts of each of the recent candidates, presented below.\nThe main thing to recognize is that all the moderate candidates, Warren included, are careerists. It’s not about helping others, it’s about them. If and when politics no longer is a viable career path for them, they will be happy to sell themselves as consultants, lobbyists, mainstream media propagandists, sit on corporate boards, and rack up speaking fees to parrot back to the ruling classes what acceptable discourse and policy is, within a capitalist and imperialist framework.\nTo see more examples of what I mean by Big-Brained Centrism, we will look at a statement, tweet, or policy idea from many of the moderate candidates, even the ones who have dropped out. We’ll start with a statement from Andrew Yang, because it might be one of the best examples of big-brained idiocy.\nYangonomics: “Beware the Technocracy”, The Accelerationist Candidate\nAndrew Yang’s entire campaign and many of his tech/start-up supporters represent exquisite examples of the big-brain mindset. In his final debate, he stated:\nThe entire capitalism/socialism dichotomy is completely out of date. The fact is when people were talking about these economic models they did not foresee the technology getting stronger, more powerful, and capable of doing the work of thousands of humans…what we have to do is get the markets working to improve our way of life…instead of following GDP and corporate profits off a cliff, we should be measuring our own health and wellness…the way forward is a new human-centered version of capitalism that actually uses the markets to improve our families lives.\nThis is absolute garbage, cloaked within the progressive notion of redefining national well-being and taking easy shots at corporate greed. Capitalism is utterly and inexorably based on over-consumption and chasing profits over everything else; there is no way to make it “human-centered”\nIf we were to take him at his word of meeting in the middle, a fair response would be that the closest version of a compromise solution for the “outdated dichotomy” is the social democratic and redistributive agenda of Bernie Sanders. More importantly, Yang is attempting to erase two hundred years of public debate as to the distinctions between two radically different economic models and the invaluable contributions of generations of activists, scholars, and citizens. Perhaps he believes that by virtue of being a “successful entrepreneur” and business owner, he can see things the rest of us can’t.\nAs for the “no one could have foreseen technology getting stronger…” give me a fucking break. You have to be drop-dead naïve or just plain ignorant to think this. You don’t think people who built the first trains, light bulbs, cars, worked in the first mills and factories, etc., couldn’t see how these inventions and new methods of production would reshape the world? Indigenous peoples, radical artists, environmentalists, communists, and anarchists have been warning about the negative impacts of industrial-scale technology for generations. In Western literature, towering figures like William Blake and Henry David Thoreau as well as many others prophetically warned of the dangers posed by the Industrial Revolution.\nWhat happened, of course, is that the monopoly power of capital never allowed for the more efficient distribution of resources to make lives better for the working classes, because there is little money to be made by helping and caring for people and the environment. Capitalism relies on parasitical master-servant relationships, exploiting nature and the working classes for as many resources and as much labor as possible in order to produce the most profit in the shortest amount of time.\nContrary to Yang’s ahistorical word salad and his implicit assumption that people in the past were stupid, those who lived hundreds of years ago were just as intelligent as today (if not more so) and realized exactly where this was leading. In a very good piece forThe Guardian,Yanis Varoufakis explains how Marx and Engels predicted our crisis over 150 years ago:\nAnyone reading the [Communist] manifesto today will be surprised to discover a picture of a world much like our own, teetering fearfully on the edge of technological innovation. In the manifesto’s time, it was the steam engine that posed the greatest challenge to the rhythms and routines of feudal life. The peasantry was swept into the cogs and wheels of this machinery and a new class of masters, the factory owners and the merchants usurped the landed gentry’s control over society. Now, it is artificial intelligence and automation that loom as disruptive threats, promising to sweep away ‘all fixed, fast-frozen relations’. ‘Constantly revolutionising … instruments of production,’ the manifesto proclaims, transform ‘the whole relations of society’, bringing about ‘constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation’.\nLike the rest of the moderate candidates, Yang is a product of his insular milieu, his ideology molded by anti-communist/Cold War/red scare propaganda and the fevered dreams of Tech-mogul capitalists. Being an entrepreneur apparently means one does not have to read or understand political economy, or basic history; one is a political expert simply based on the ability to “create jobs.” He is the Silicon Valley candidate, those true believers in unrestrained automation who believe they understand the economy better than everyone else because they’ve spent the most time sitting through meetings about “corporate synergy.”\n“Sensible” policy must be in the center, as one of his slogans suggests: “Not Left, Not Right, Forward.” Yang, Warren, and Mayor Pete were considered “the smart candidates” by the media and many liberals. Primarily because they mirror back upper-middle class narcissism and promise not to disturb the security and comfort of the affluent. This just goes to show how simpleminded and anti-intellectual mainstream political commentary has become. Capitalism has had over 200 years to develop the chance to become “human centered.” It cannot because it is fundamentally set up to serve the profit motive over basic needs of people. Capitalist markets have always skewed the vast majority of benefits to the upper classes, with pipe dreams of wealth “trickling down” to the masses.\nYang could have made much more progress had he tacked harder to the left, but instead he falls prey to his belief in “human-centered capitalism.” His UBI proposal was popular; yet as an affluent business owner and stand-in for the entrepreneur class, he could not manage to go against his donors as well as his own interests by creating a framework for price controls to fight against inflation and parasitical price-gouging. Despite his concern over AI and automation leading to massive job loss, he does not fundamentally address the exploitative relationship between employer and employees, or understand how increased digital and robot-led production will lead to new levels of coercive labor monopolization of the means of production.\nOne Mike Weinstein explains Yang’s worldview quite well here, in a piece titled “Beware the Technocracy”:\nYang speaks the language of the ruling class, one of inscrutable economics to uphold the narrative of technology as savior. His aim is cloak this in popular socialist ideas such as universal healthcare and income. Yang promotes this package as a self-proclaimed ‘human-centered economy’. It’s worth noting that the robot antagonists in The Matrix had a human-centered economy, too.\nAndrew Yang is a privileged tech-bro, but he had one thing going for him, he was earnest, somewhat open-minded, and willing to listen to others. In this piece, his interviewer sketches out the basics of accelerationism to Yang, implying that this is the first time Yang has heard of the idea, and Yang responds with interest, wanting to know more. Yang, unlike the rest of the moderates, might be a know-nothing; but at least he can have a human conversation, and is at least open to learning about new ideas.\nHis refusal to include a social safety net for the needy, disabled, and elderly that could stand to lose under his UBI, as well as his refusal to endorse Medicare for All, is further proof of his myopia, however. See this summary of his thought, published inBig Think, or this one, atTed.com, both of which specialize in big-brain centrism. Yang also proposed to raise revenue for the UBI via a value-added tax, which is a tax on consumption and disproportionately hurts low-income workers, rather than a more sensible wealth tax.\nWarren: Feel-good candidate for the Professional-Managerial Class\nElizabeth Warren also tacked to the center, repeatedly describing herself as “capitalist to her bones”. While the act of adopting progressive liberal values and rhetoric mixed with pro-capitalist corporate-speak worked in the past, for instance, for Obama and even for Jimmy Carter before him, there is no popular “middle ground” to occupy now in the Democratic Party. The 2008 economic crisis advanced political consciousness in such a way that mainstream liberals now see the ground shifting underneath them. Either you are a firm Democratic establishment centrist, or you’re in the progressive/social democratic/democratic socialist camp.\nWarren, straddling both sides of this fault line, could not seem to pick a lane. Her attacks on the banks and her wealth tax proposal would seem to mark her as a progressive, but her professional-managerial class (PMC) background pulls her to support the Clinton/Obama technocratic way of governing. Politics is about having big ideas and pointing out the systemic problems in society (which Bernie Sanders has, and does) and finding ways to implement them; not about having a series of band-aid solutions and incoherent plans for “structural change” without examining the root cause of our maladies: capitalism. No one wants to hear flip-flopping about a “transition plan” to shift to Medicare for All in three years. People want to know that you will fight for them on day one, because every day that you hesitate poor and homeless people literally die in the streets because of lack of access to health care; also men, women, and children are killed each day due to our imperial and frankly genocidal foreign policy, which she demonstrated hardly any basic knowledge of, or real interest towards.\nBoth Warren’s wealth tax and her climate plan were considerable tamer than Sanders’ plans. If you’re going to challenge corporate power, even within the confines of US electoral politics, you can’t excite the “populist” liberal-left with halfway measures. Voters were canny enough to see through her fence-sitting, hence her relative lack of support, even within her home state of Massachusetts.\nOne of Warren’s most glaringly dystopian plans was for “fighting digital disinformation”. There is a glimmer of a good idea hidden in the concept, in that she proposed penalties for those who engage in voter suppression. The real doozy is that she plans to criminalize “disinformation” and wants the corporate social media behemoths like Facebook and Twitter to censor and moderate political speech, as well as leaving the door open for government censorship of news. In this she parrots the desires of the Democratic establishment who, of course, are deeply entwined with the Military-Industrial-Intelligence complex. Liberal establishment figures have become emboldened since 2016: for instance Hillary Clinton views anyone who disturbs her as being aided by Russia; such as Trump, but also Jill Stein and Tulsi Gabbard, absurdly. Liberals such as Warren aim to increase paranoia in the populace, consciously or not, surrounding the idea of “foreign meddling” and seek to weaponize the election interference narrative against any politicians who do not support the ruling class. This is why Bernie Sanders was told his campaign was being aided by Russia, in effect to smear his entire campaign. The real targets in the “interference” narrative are leftists who want to redistribute wealth.\nAgent Pete\nPete Buttigieg represents a special type of stupid. First, Buttigieg’s policies (or lack thereof) show just how worthless a Rhodes scholar-level education truly is, just like it showed for Cory Booker. Just like Kamala Harris, Buttigieg is the offspring of a worldly and erudite Marxist professor who didn’t learn a thing; in Mayor Pete’s case, he decided to rebel against his father and workfor the machinein the killing fields of Afghanistan and the corrupt scandal-ridden firm McKinsey.\nThere is much more to the Mayor Pete back-story regarding his intelligence and national security connections. He worked in Naval Intelligence in Afghanistan alongside the CIA. He penned an op-ed inThe New York Timeswith a friend about visiting Somaliland and meeting with “local leaders.” He keeps a map of Afghanistan displaying its mineral resources in his study (the alarm bells should be going off). He wrote in his book about visiting a “safehouse” in Iraq. Many foreign policy and national security figures backed his candidacy. And yes, thanks to Left Twitter, #CIAPete was blowing up on social media.\nWhether or not Mayor Pete is a spy asset or not does not really matter. What matters is hethinks like them,and shares their worldview of supporting US imperial and economic domination at all costs.\nHow do we know this is true? Buttigieg had a line in a recent debate about “being inclusive” by taking donations from billionaires. Who honestly thinks taking money from billionaires is to make society more inclusive? Only a little slug willing to completely debase himself to his ruling-class overlords would admit this publicly; even Biden at his most incoherent would never blurt this out.\nListening to Pete talk in general was just bewildering. He imitates Obama’s style at every turn, yet cannot match his soaring oratory and simply does not answer questions or deliver any tangible idea of what he will offer. He is the platitude candidate; every time he speaks it’s like opening a fortune cookie, as he’s full of vague truisms.\nOne of the most dystopian plans of Pete was a “National Service Program”. Predictably, it is framed with patriotic, nationalistic rhetoric. The goal would be to increase the service program with the end goal being a “universal, national expectation of service” (from his website) while also claiming it will be “strictly optional”. High school and college students are already exploited enough in the classroom and at their jobs, and funding a plan so that young people can put a gold star on their resume pretty much sums up Pete in a nutshell. Here’s his justification:\nIn the great unwinding of American civic society underway, and at a time when Americans are experiencing record-low trust in fellow citizens and American institutions, few — if any — single policy solutions carry the promise of democratic renewal more than national service.\nA simple rebuttal would be to ask what is causing the “unwinding” and “record-low trust”. It’s obviously inequality, corruption in government, corporations which are legally bound to choose profits over people, little to no regulation of technology and fossil fuel corporations, monopolization in virtually every sector of the economy, lack of health care and a living wage. There is no indication that this plan would solve any of these issues, because the Oxford-educated Mayor cannot be bothered to think critically. Or, rather, an Oxford education blinds one to the fact that capitalism is the root cause of our systemic crises. Typical of elites, he confuses class conflict with national frailty and disunity, much like Trump. He is a true believer in the system, and projects his privileged fake-meritocratic upbringing onto everyone around him with a call to service. Any national service plan with Pete at the helm feels like a plan for assimilating youth into our Death Star corporate-driven empire; for creating a “McKinsey Youth” for America.\nSteyer and Bloomberg: Upholding a Nation Run for Plutocrats, by Plutocrats\nToday one must be for the poor and working classes to gain mass political popularity, like Sanders; or conversely offer a proto-fascist program of a return to national greatness, like the racist, money-worshipping, chauvinist Twitter troll, like Trump. That is why the elites are even more afraid of Sanders, because he and more crucially his base offer a clean break and a qualitatively better and more egalitarian organization of society.\nThe super-rich must be excluded from the political process because they will always put the interests of capital above the common good, and refuse to see how their actions directly contribute to the impoverishment of workers and the degradation of the environment. Any intervention by them, in the name of philanthropy or donations to politicians, proves that their money buys political power, social control, and makes a mockery of any notion of “democracy” in this nation. This is called an oligarchy. Which reminds me, Mike Bloomberg should no longer be addressed as “Mayor Bloomberg”; “Plutocrat Bloomberg” or “Oligarch Bloomberg” would be more appropriate.\nAmy’s Rage\nAmy Klobuchar is a lot of things. She is undoubtedly driven, hard-working, and passionate about her work. The problem is the work she does is inherently bad for most people and she did not have any good policy ideas that differentiated her from the other centrists. Her other problem is that she hasextremeanger issues.\nKlobuchar is an abusive boss and her employees described her offices in Minnesota and D.C. as a “hostile work environment.” The most she’s addressed this is by stating she’s “tough” and has “high expectations” for her staff. The clues to her barely-bottled rage are under the surface, as this article inThe Atlanticopines: her childhood spent with a neglectful, alcoholic father severely messed her up.\nThis is not an uncommon situation, with a subset of leaders put into positions of power that were traumatized in childhood. Many become highly-driven over-achievers in the corporate and political worlds: it’s easier to run from the ghosts when you’re showered with accolades and money. Many also burn with rage, are vengeful and prone to irrational outbursts, consider any slight or unavoidable accident a personal affront, and crave domination and control over others. Much like management in large corporations, her former staff describes a brutal hierarchical and tyrannical environment where the smallest mistake could set her off into tantrums or the throwing of office supplies, forcing staff to do demeaning work involving her personal effects, and would regularly condescend and shame her employees openly in person and through email. We already have an authoritarian in the White House who needs psychological counseling. Klobuchar should not be attempting to seek power: like the rest of the corporate and political ruling classes, she should be seeking professional help.\nBiden: Senior Moments\nLet’s just get it out of the way: Joe Biden is seriously slipping upstairs. I suppose that’s not an anomaly anymore for presidential politics, as we have dealt with cognitive decline before with Reagan in his second term. We’ve dealt with not-so-bright presidents too: the entire George W. Bush presidency, and now Trump. If Biden becomes the nominee and president it will be a national, collective senior moment. I don’t really have the words to describe a head-to-head Biden-Trump debate, other than it being extremely depressing, and that I would predict an increase in sales of alcohol. It would break the country on some visceral level. Nominating Biden could end the Democratic Party for good, so maybe there would be a silver lining.\nInterestingly, Biden spoke to donors in 2019 and stated that “no one’s standard of living would change” and “nothing would fundamentally change” if he became elected. It would make for an honest slogan, at least. Vote Biden in 2020: Nothing will change.\nWhen moderate democrats say “be realistic”, say it back to them: be realistic, Biden would surely lose to Trump. Only Sanders has a shot at defeating him, as Trump would absolutely eviscerate Biden and run circles around him. Even a broken clock is right twice a day, and Trump is as broken a person as they come; but he is smart enough to harp on Biden’s mental decline and his son’s shady job as a board member of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, a position he had absolutely no expertise in.\nOh Canada!?: Trudeau Marches for Climate\nThe most ridiculous and absurd example of big-brain centrism comes from our neighbor to the North, however. In September of 2019, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took part in a climate protest in Montreal. He tweeted: “Today we marched for our planet, our kids, and for their future.” It did not seem to dawn on him that his fellow citizens were marching to protest the lack of actionhis governmentwas taking to battle global warming. You’re their leader, Justin. If you want to take action, use every available mechanism inyour own governmentto make a change. The people put you in power to do exactly that. Was he protesting himself? Was he admitting that even as PM he is as powerless as the average citizen to fight the fossil fuel industries? Under his administration, Albertan oil sands continue to be extracted, and new pipeline expansion is in place against the will of the Wet’suwet’en First Nations tribe who are currently protesting.\nThe Moderates Serve the Ruling Class\nJust to stick with Trudeau’s nastiness for a moment, everyone should read this article on the First Nation protestors in Canada fighting the Coastal GasLink Pipeline expansion. If you feel called, watch the embedded video. The RMCP point their rifles at nonviolent protestors- police who operate under the orders of Justin Trudeau. Make no mistake, Biden would be no different in the US. He serves at the behest of the ruling classes. It doesn’t matter if it’s Obama with Occupy Wall Street and the Dakota Access Pipeline, Trump, Trudeau, or a possible Biden regime: they all will intimidate and if necessary kill their own citizens who use direct action to resist fossil fuel expansion and corporate rule. It’s all a sick twisted game to protect the property of the rich for the “sensible”, “highly-esteemed”, blue-check mark politicians and media flunkies.\nEven if the moderate liberals gave one single solitary fuck about average working people, the environment, future generations, and the citizenry they pander to, they are too weak-minded because they insist everything be done at the glacial pace (as glaciers are now in rapid retreat in many parts of the world this metaphor may no longer be useful, thanks to them) of bipartisan electoral politics, and will compromise with conservatives at every turn to water-down absolutely any and every possible progressive or radical legislative reforms.\nLike Trudeau, they all want to have it both ways: to be seen as a progressive, “woke” politician; a radical climate protestor in his case, while at the same time being central figures of the establishment, upholding an inhumane system, walking corpses who prop up the status quo, absolute tools of corporate and imperial rule. Which in the end means that they really only care about themselves: their fame, power, glory, and their money.\nBernie Sanders has his own serious flaws, most especially in regards to foreign policy. Yet he is the only candidate who speaks to the need to create a better, kinder, more reasonable and egalitarian nation; and the best chance to popularize socialism right now, however ill-suited he may be to the task.\nEven Hillary Clinton weighed in on Sanders recently and said “nobody likes him, no one wants to work with him.” It might be worthwhile for citizens and neoliberal imperialists like Clinton, Biden, Trudeau, and the rest to question what it means to be “popular” and what positive “work” has actually been accomplished in a Congress which hasn’t cracked a 30% approval rating in over 10 years.\nThere are a couple of references from pop culture which sum up the sad but true nature of the centrist liberal and conservative politicians. Their commitment to strengthening capitalism at all costs leads to a hollow shell of a life. The first quote is from the movieCasino Jack,a fictionalized version of the corrupt lobbyist Jack Abramoff’s life. When the walls are closing in on him, his wife reminds him there will be no one to help: “We have no friends, Jack, none. All we have are people we do business with.”\nThe second set of quotes, which I’ll end with, are from rap legend Tupac Shakur. In the song “Holler If You Hear Me”, 2pac warns of the perils of compromising one’s beliefs for material gain:\nTo the sellouts livin’ it up/\nOne way or another you’ll be givin’ it up.\nIn the last verse, 2pac has a prophetic line, alluding to black militancy, manufacturing consent and the return of the repressed in American society. His words remain eerily prescient, and remind me of the way moderate liberals and conservatives view the rise of Bernie Sanders and socialism in the US today as dangerous:\nAnd now I’m like a major threat/\n‘Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget"}, {"url": "https://www.albidda.net/arab/3624265.html", "title": "Russia announces the end of the first phase of work to manufacture a vaccine against SK", "text": "We show you our visitors the most important and latest news in the following article:\nRussia announces the end of the first phase of work to manufacture a vaccine against Corona, today, Monday, March 23, 2020 02:50 pm\nThe head of the Russian Medical and Biological Agency, Veronica Skvortsova, announced today, Monday, that the agency's work to develop a vaccine against the emerging corona virus \"Covid 19\" has passed its first stage.\nWhile the headquarters of anti-Corona Virus operations in Russia announced today, Monday, that the Corona virus detection test was conducted on more than 165 thousand people, and more than 72 thousand people are still under medical supervision because of the suspected infection with the virus.\nA representative of the Russian \"Azure-Air\" company announced that a special flight of the company took off to Morocco to evacuate Russian citizens from there in light of the spread of the \"Corona\" virus.\nVyacheslav Eileen, head of the department of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, believes that the SK virus is not excluded from falling into a meteorite on Chinese soil.\nThe Russian Civil Aviation Authority announced that all flights between Russia and foreign countries will be stopped from midnight, except for regular flights from Moscow to the capitals of other countries or big cities, and charter flights to return Russian citizens to their homeland, according to the government's mandate issued on March 20.\nSource\nThe nation’s voice\nSubscribe to the newsletter to get the most important news as soon as it is published\nFollow us on social media"}, {"url": "https://alaraby-media.net/%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A3%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1/", "title": "A Russian scientist reveals a surprise about the source of corona that hit China", "text": "A Russian scientist reveals a surprise about the source of corona that hit China\nVyacheslav Eileen, head of the department of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, believes that the SK virus is not excluded from falling into a meteorite on Chinese soil.\nEileen told Russian news agency RIA Novosti, “Chandra Wikrasingh, a famous outdoor biologist from Cardiff University in Wales, announced several days ago that he is not (...)"}, {"url": "https://fr.sputniknews.com/international/202003191043330208-soupconnee-de-desinformation-la-russie-met-en-cause-lincapacite-de-lue-face-au-covid-19/", "title": "Suspected of disinformation, Russia questions the EU's \"incapacity\" in the face of Covid-19", "text": "Suspected by the EU of spreading misinformation on the coronavirus, Russia on Thursday denounced \"unfounded\" and \"immoral\" accusations aimed at camouflaging the \"inability\" of the European institutions to fight the spread of the disease, reports l 'AFP.\nMoscow immediately qualified these accusations as “gratuitous”.\nRussian diplomacy spokeswoman Maria Zakharova thus denounced on March 19 \"an immoral attempt to hide via unfounded accusations her own inability to fight\" against the pandemic in Europe.\n\"It is not the first time that the EU has sought to blame Moscow for some of the problems it faces,\" she said.\n“If there are charges, there must be evidence.

The country has 1929 infected and 23 dead. All universities are closed, but kindergartens and schools are open so that working Swedes have a lot to give their children to. Testing of persons with symptoms of coronavirus is not carried out, because of which the real number of patients cannot be established.\nIn many countries, the situation is no better. In Spain, due to a lack of medical personnel and medicines, doctors were ordered to save first of all those patients whose chances of recovery are higher.\nIn the United States, the state of New York (419 dead) became the epicenter of the spread of the epidemic.

In France, 20,000 patients, 860 deaths, 5,000 prisoners are about to be released, due to the threat of the spread of coronavirus in prisons.

In Russia, they found how to neutralize a new coronavirus\nIn less than a week, the virologists from the Novosibirsk State Scientific Center “Vector” have developed a diagnostic test system for a new dangerous coronavirus from Wuhan, China, which will allow it to be detected at an early stage of the disease.\nBut it's too early to talk about creating a vaccine. State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin instructed the Duma Health Protection Committee to work out antiviral measures for the country.\nA new type of coronavirus with the scientific name 2019-nCoV was discovered at the very end of last year in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. To date, in China itself, nine people have died from pneumonia caused by the virus, and the number of cases is close to five hundred. A positive reaction to the Wuhan death tests was revealed in patients in South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Singapore.\nRecently, the first infected with a new virus was discovered in the United States. It turned out to be a Chinese tourist. Experts believe that the number of people infected with coronavirus, but not yet discovered around the world can go to thousands. Chinese doctors have officially confirmed that the new virus can be transmitted not only through contact with animals, as previously assumed, but also from humans - that is, by airborne droplets.\nOn the eve of the first \"suspected\" Chinese tourist with a high temperature was taken off the flight at the Khabarovsk airport. After his emergency hospitalization and blood test, it turned out that he was infected with the usual seasonal flu (virus A H1N1). Doctors breathed a sigh of relief, but were not going to relax. All passengers arriving from Southeast Asia are scanned with thermal imagers at airports for elevated temperatures. Hospitals in the Amur Region are on full alert. Similarly, throughout the country - especially in large transport hubs - preventive measures are being taken. In particular, sanitary-quarantine control at checkpoints across the state border has been strengthened, and the epidemiological situation has been monitored on a daily basis.\nAll passengers arriving from Southeast Asia are checked for viruses. Photo: Xiao Yijiu / Globallookpress\nSurprisingly quickly - less than seven days after the publication of information about the genetic passport of the virus - the specialists of the Vector scientific center, which is part of the Rospotrebnadzor system, created “means for laboratory diagnosis of a new pathogen,” the department said.\nNovosibirsk has developed two independent diagnostic kits, the action of which is based on the molecular genetic method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using one, you can directly detect the 2019-nCoV virus at an early stage, and the second to diagnose another dangerous disease that humanity has previously encountered is SARS, also called SARS. The PCR method is extremely sensitive: it can even detect single copies of viruses in just 2-4 hours. For this, a small smear from the nasopharynx is enough. Thus, express diagnostics can be carried out right on the spot in the compact laboratories of the Centers for Hygiene and Epidemiology of Rospotrebnadzor scattered throughout the country.\nRecall that \"Vector\" is one of the largest scientific virological and biotechnological centers in Russia and in the world, organized back in 1974. Here, one of our first test systems for diagnosing HIV and hepatitis B, the first genetic engineering human a2b interferon in Russia, was developed and started to be produced here; the immunostimulating drug \"Ridostin\" and many other unique medicines, which indicates the continued high level of our microbiologists, despite the long-term pogrom of science.\n“It is impossible to develop a vaccine in a week,” explained the former head of Rospotrebnadzor, State Duma deputy, doctor of medical sciences Gennady Onishchenko, explained to Tsargrad. - Evaluation of effectiveness also takes time. We need to work on the vaccine, if only from the point of view of pure science, for the future. But as a defense system, it cannot yet be evaluated. This is the seventh edition of the coronavirus, known to mankind since 1965. Our country still has not used vaccination against them. It must be understood that different infections require total or regional vaccination only in the event of a disease. In this case, there is no such need. ”\nIn the Russian laboratory, surprisingly quickly developed two diagnostic kits, the action of which is based on the molecular genetic method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Photo: Anton Veselov / Shutterstock.com\n“No, Wuhan is not far from us,” Onishchenko retorts our “soothing” question. - The city is closer than it seems to many. After all, we are talking about a severe acute respiratory infection, which is very easy to transmit - I got on a plane, and after a few hours the virus is already here. Therefore, by the way, I would have refrained from traveling to China. ”\nOne of the past mutations of the coronavirus, called SARS, or “SARS,” said Gennady Grigoryevich, in the early 2000s, 9,000 patients and 700 dead people were noted. Therefore, in any case, one must be on guard. Of course, there is no reason to panic either.\nBut this natural or intentional, man-made mutation of the coronavirus remains to be seen. The fact that this is another attack of the coronavirus can be caused by the use of bioweapons, suggested a former member of the UN biological weapons commission and adviser to the organization’s secretary general Igor Nikulin. He recalled the high-profile scandal of 2010, when one of the 400 military bio-laboratories scattered around the world, owned by the US Navy, was closed in Indonesia, because secret experiments with bird flu were conducted there. The virus, leaving the laboratory walls, caused an outbreak of a dangerous disease, and the Yankees refused to transmit information about their sinister work to the Ministry of Health of Indonesia.\nToday, the World Health Organization (WHO) is holding an emergency meeting in connection with the outbreak of a new coronavirus. Experts from Rospotrebnadzor also participate in it, as Elena Yezhlova, head of the epidemiological surveillance department of this federal service, said today. The result of the meeting should be an assessment of the degree of threat of a pandemic, as well as recommendations to medical and sanitary services around the world.\nWe continue to monitor the situation.\nHelp of Constantinople:\nCoronaviruses are microorganisms from a single-stranded RNA molecule in the form of a sphere with rare spikes in shape, like a mace, and resembling the solar corona during an eclipse.

It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\nIn this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans.\nResearchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than previously thought.\"\nIn contrast, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify \"potential risks\".\nSimon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on the news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: \"If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.\"\nIn October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on \"job promotion\", especially those causing serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans."}, {"url": "https://lomazoma.com/saudi/1553838.html", "title": "The page is not available", "text": "Sorry, the page you are trying to reach is not available.

Stored in \"Sierra Army Depots,\" in northern California \"and possibly in other areas.\"\nIt is noteworthy that the then US administration introduced \"Article 817\" to the articles of the Patriot Act, 2001, whereby the government would allow the development and storage of biological weapons and their release systems without restrictions, that is, a practical abolition of the texts of the international agreement signed on it.\nWhat is striking and disturbing is what was predicted by the then Deputy Minister of Homeland Security, Daniel Gerstein, addressing the aforementioned international conference, 2012, that his country \"expects an outbreak of a pandemic by the end of 2013.\" “Diagnosis” was shared by Dr. Joseph Kim at the Enuvio Vaccine Production Company.\nThe official American prediction of a pandemic before it occurred raised a range of questions and speculation about the dangerous extent of the biological weapons program and its threat to the lives and welfare of large numbers of people.\nHollywood was accompanied by the production of a movie called Contagion in 2011, which revolves around a pandemic caused by bats, according to the prepared scenario, which is currently taking place with the Corona pandemic in China, which is likely to be the source of the virus in Wuhan.\nIn the context of the American “prediction”, China was exposed in 2013 to a massive wave of “bird flu - H7N9,” which immediately started to exterminate millions of chicken birds and the negative repercussions it left not only on its economy, but at the global level to ban trade and dealing with Beijing. Repeat it these days also.\nOn January 31, the US government announced that it had implemented \"new measures to combat the Corona virus, including preventing Chinese citizens from entering\" its territory, and applying quarantine to individuals coming from there.\n“Cuba in 1971 was the first country in the Caribbean to announce its exposure to a dengue epidemic. It is believed that its source came from Spain.” That was the summary of a 2009 medical publication from the prestigious US Institutes of Health. Cuba, in turn, accused the US government of spreading the epidemic that infected its livestock from pigs and of having to exterminate half a million heads.\nScientifically, the Corona virus infects the human respiratory system, similar to the previous SARS epidemic - acute pneumonia - and the origins of the two strains are from animals transmitted to humans, and then to its human brother; And spread to Saudi Arabia in 2012, causing severe pneumonia to the patient.\nSome experts in the field of biological sciences suggest that the US government will engage in \"designing a biological attack against China for geopolitical considerations,\" coinciding with the spread of \"a new and dangerous epidemic\" with Chinese New Year celebrations to paralyze the Chinese society, the vast majority of whom will use transportation to return to their original villages.\nProfessor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, Richard Eberat, expressed to the Washington Post his doubts about the American source because \"the genome of the virus and its properties do not indicate that it is the kind produced\" in the laboratory.\nThe newspaper and US circles in general have accused China of developing biological weapons in the Wuhan facility for \"engaging in espionage actions to obtain biological components.\"\nEarly this week, he recorded a federal court filing an indictment against Harvard professor Charles Lieber “and two people of Chinese nationality for trying to smuggle 21 tubes containing biological materials to China;” and Lieber receives a monthly reward of $ 50,000 from Wuhan Technical University, according to the indictment.\nWhat reinforces the hypotheses of the American source of the virus is the Trump administration’s policy to fight China by all means, starting with trade wars, and also subjecting it to a series of “deadly bacterial attacks, viral diseases, and symptoms targeting both livestock and humans.”\nEpidemiologist at the Rand Institute, Jennifer Bowie, confirmed the close link between the two epidemics (SARS and Corona), as the \"compatibility ratio between them is at least 70% of genetic material and transmission mechanisms ... The mortality rate for those with SARS is about 10%, compared to 3\" % For Corona virus. ”\nBowie praised the transparency of scientists and the Chinese government and the “sharing of international scientific edifices with the genome data of the virus,” and reached them to find the causes within a short period of time, not exceeding a few days, which will contribute to developing an effective vaccine soon.\nThe American epidemiologist, Dina Grayson, expressed concern about a set of facts surrounding the Corona virus, especially the high speed of its spread from person to person.\nIt is worth noting that Corona virus is a US product with distinction, according to the registry of invention submitted in 2015, which was approved in 2018.\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US10130701B2/en?oq=10130701\nIn the same context, there are strange \"separate\" incidents that targeted China originating in North America; the most prominent of which was the shipment arrival of a source from Canadian biological laboratories, in the month of March 2019, which included \"viruses,\" Canadians claimed that it is \"part of the research efforts to support public health research in the world . ” It is noteworthy that this shipment was carried out under the veil of secrecy, in contrast to the usual procedures, which prompted the Chinese side to file a formal complaint.\nA large US military delegation, consisting of 300 personnel, arrives in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on October 19, 2019, to participate in a military games festival hosted by China held there. On November 2, 2019, the first infection with the Corona virus was recorded in that province, and it later spread rapidly in December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days.\nThe cost of what China has been exposed to as a result of the epidemic is prohibitive by all measures: disruption of flights and the movement of trains and other transportation at the height of its largest and most important annual feasts; Daily and phenomenal business exchanges with the world.\nIn sum, who can answer the question of the identity of the beneficiary of all this can reach the heart of the matter: waging wars with biological weapons at a lower cost than nuclear engagement."}, {"url": "https://www.fondsk.ru/news/2020/03/27/etot-na-udivlenie-izbiratelnyj-virus-50467.html", "title": "This surprisingly selective virus ... - Strategic Culture Fund", "text": "The wider the coronavirus pandemic spreads, the greater the clarity regarding the area of damage to them. And more and more questions about the source of origin of COVID-19.\nThe virus bypasses countries that are aloof from the main problems of world politics, and spreads to territories where the interests of world players clash. Of course, other countries are also affected by the pandemic, but there is no need to talk about the particular danger to them.\nHere are some figures from a German source for March 24:\nCountry\nGot sick\nRecovered\nIs dead\nCurrently sick\nUSA\n85612\n1868\n1301\n82443\nItaly\n80589\n10361\n8215\n62013\nSpain\n57786\n7015\n4365\n46406\nGermany\n47278\n5673\n281\n41324\nFrance\n29155\n4948\n1696\n22511\nIran\n32332\n11133\n2378\n18821\nSwitzerland\n11811\n131\n194\n11486\nUnited Kingdom\n11658\n135\n578\n10945\nNetherlands\n7431\n3\n434\n6994\nAustria\n7129\n225\n58\n6846\nBelgium\n6235\n675\n220\n5340\nSouth Korea\n9332\n4528\n139\n4665\nCanada\n4043\n228\n39\n3776\nTurkey\n3629\n26\n75\n3528\nChina\n81340\n74588\n3292\n3460\nPortugal\n3544\n43\n60\n3441\nThe virus chose China, Iran, Italy and Spain as the main targets. In ticks between Spain and Italy - France. The virus affected their neighbors less or not at all. And in Mongolia, for example, on March 23, only one case of the disease was registered, although in the country there are as many Chinese as there are Mongols, and movement is going through the Sino-Mongolian border.\nChina is a strategic adversary of the United States. In connection with the pandemic, China stopped the production of several industries, GDP growth slowed down, the yuan fell. However, the PRC was able to counter the pandemic with a centralized, well-functioning infection localization system. At the same time, Beijing bought up its “junk bonds”, which fell in price, substantially compensating for losses in the international financial market. Now the number of newly diagnosed diseases in China is approaching zero, the authorities are already taking down control over the movement of people and goods between Hubei and the rest of the country. The human losses of the PRC (3,270 people per 1.4 billion people) are insignificant in percentage terms. The main conclusion: the country was ready for large-scale, effective mobilization activities in an emergency.\nIt suffers greatly from the invasion of the Iran virus, with which China has neither a common border nor a lively exchange of people. And in this case, the epidemic in Iran is beneficial to Washington, which refuses to lift anti-Iranian economic sanctions. Mortality from the epidemic in Iran more than doubled the world average and amounted to 7.8%. The US administration said that they would not allow Iran to sell oil for the purchase of medicines and equipment.\nA situation similar to Iran could be in warring Syria. Both of these countries are objects of increased US interest.\nTake Italy and Spain, the two countries in Europe most affected by the pandemic. The Italian government has entered into conflict with Brussels and does not make concessions on the payment of public debt and a deficit budget. The European Commission refused to approve the Italian version of the proposals on this issue. There was a threat of Italy's exit from the EU. Against this background, the drama is unfolding with the growth of the epidemic in the country of pines and pensioners. Italy sets a mournful record for the level of victims - more than 10% of deaths from the number of cases. In neighboring Austria, Switzerland, and Germany, the scale of the pandemic is incomparably smaller.\nRoughly the same situation in Spain, which is constantly shaken by Catalan separatism.\nSeparately, we must talk about the drama that takes place in the United States. According to available information, by March 26, the United States of America came first in the world in the number of detected diseases of the coronavirus. Here the epidemic becomes the argument of the Democrats in the ongoing election campaign with Trump. Some media outlets predict America’s millions of sick people and hundreds of thousands of dead by summer-autumn, citing the following figures: for 330 million US citizens — 55 thousand infected and 379 dead. For comparison: the last three years, the number of deaths in road accidents in the United States has been at the level of 40 thousand people. Trump's trump cards are low unemployment and support for national business; the pandemic is a major blow to these components of America’s socio-economic situation.\nThe experience of China shows that the spread of coronavirus can be localized. It all depends, firstly, on the state of the healthcare system, and secondly, on the quality and speed of management decisions made by the authorities. Selectivity of the spread of the virus by country is a direct indication of its artificial origin.

It contained the United States' violation of the treaty due to its involvement in an activity related to the development of an offensive biological weapons program They are stored in Sierra Army Depots, in northern California and possibly in other regions. \"\nIt is noteworthy that the then US administration introduced \"Article 817\" to the articles of the Patriot Act, 2001, and it allows the government to develop and store biological weapons and their release systems without restrictions, that is, practically canceling the texts of the international agreement signed on it.\nWhat is striking and disturbing is what was \"foretold\" by the then Deputy Minister of Homeland Security, Daniel Gerstein, addressing the aforementioned international conference, 2012, that his country \"expects a pandemic by the end of 2013\". The diagnosis was shared by Dr. Joseph Kim at the Enuvio Vaccine Production Company.\nThe official American prediction of a pandemic before it occurred raised a range of questions and speculation about the dangerous extent of the biological weapons program and its threat to the lives and welfare of large numbers of people.\nThe Hollywood community accompanied it with the production of a movie called Contagion in 2011, which revolves around a pandemic caused by bats, according to the prepared scenario, which is currently taking place with the Corona epidemic in China, which is likely to be the source of the virus in Wuhan Province.\nIn the context of the American \"prediction\", China was exposed in 2013 to a massive wave of \"bird flu - H7N9\", as it immediately began to exterminate millions of chicken birds, and this not only left negative repercussions on its economy, but at the global level to ban trade and dealing with Beijing. We are seeing it happening again these days.\nOn January 31, the US government announced its implementation of \"new measures to counter the Corona virus, including preventing Chinese citizens from entering its territory\"; and applying quarantine to individuals coming from there.\n“In 1971, Cuba was the first country in the Caribbean to announce its exposure to a dengue (dengue) epidemic, and it is believed to originate in Spain.” This was the summary of a medical bulletin issued by prestigious US health institutes in 2009. Cuba, in turn, accused the US government of spreading the epidemic Its animal wealth from pigs and it was forced to exterminate half a million heads.\nScientifically, the Corona virus infects the human respiratory system, which is similar to the previous SARS epidemic - acute pneumonia - and the origins of the two strains are from animals and have been transmitted to humans, and then to its human brother; , Due to its appearance and spread in Saudi Arabia in 2012, causing severe pneumonia to the patient.\nSome experts in the field of biological sciences suggest that the US government will engage in \"designing a biological attack against China for geopolitical considerations\", coinciding with the spread of \"the new epidemic and danger\" with the Chinese New Year celebrations to paralyze Chinese society, a large majority of whom will use transportation to return to their original villages.\nProfessor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, Richard Iberat, expressed to the Washington Post his doubts about the American source because \"the genome of the virus and its properties do not indicate that it is the kind produced in vitro\".\nThe newspaper and US circles have been charged with developing China for developing biological weapons in the Wuhan facility for a year, for \"engaging in espionage activities to obtain biological components.\"\nIt was recorded earlier this week that a federal court directed an indictment against Harvard professor Charles Lieber and \"two people of Chinese nationality for their attempts to smuggle 21 tubes inside of biological material into China\", and Lieber receives a monthly reward of $ 50,000 from Wuhan Technical University, according to the indictment .\nWhat strengthens the hypotheses of the American source of the virus is the Trump administration’s policy of fighting China by all means, starting with trade wars, and also exposing it to a series of “deadly bacterial attacks and viral diseases, and symptoms targeting both livestock and humans.”\nThe Epidemiologist at the Rand Institute, Jennifer Bowie, confirmed the close link between the two epidemics (SARS and Corona) as \"the compatibility ratio between them is at least 70% of genetic material and transmission mechanisms. The mortality rate for those with SARS is about 10%, compared to 3\" % For Corona virus \".\nBoi praised the transparency of scientists and the Chinese government, and the \"sharing of the international scientific edifice with the genome data of the virus,\" and reached them to know the causes within a short period of time, not exceeding a few days, which will contribute to developing an effective vaccine soon.\nThe American epidemiologist, Dina Grayson, expressed concern about a set of facts surrounding the Corona virus, especially from the high speed of its spread from one person to another \"It is not only contagious, but kills the infected.\" Grayson has long experience in developing drugs to treat the Ebola epidemic.\nIt is worth noting that Corona virus is a US product with distinction, according to the registry of invention submitted in 2015, which was approved in 2018.\nIn the same context, there are \"separate\" strange incidents that targeted China originating in North America; the most prominent of which was the shipment arrival of a source from Canadian biological laboratories, in March 2019, which included \"malicious viruses,\" which the Canadians claimed was \"part of the research efforts to support public health research.\" In the world.\" It is worth noting that this shipment was carried out under the veil of secrecy, in contrast to the usual procedures, which prompted the Chinese side to file a formal complaint in this regard.\nA large US military delegation, consisting of 300 people, arrives in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China on October 19, 2019, to participate in a military games festival hosted by China and held there. On November 2, 2019, the first infection with the Corona virus was recorded in that province, and it later spread rapidly in December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days.\nThe cost of what China has been exposed to as a result of the epidemic is prohibitive by all measures: disruption of flights and the movement of trains and other transportation at the height of its largest and most important annual holidays; and the stricken Wuhan municipality imposed a ban on leaving the town on the population “only for emergency reasons; Everyday life and tremendous business exchanges with the world.\nUltimately, who can answer the question about who benefits from all this can reach the heart of the matter: waging wars with biological weapons at a lower cost than nuclear engagement."}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5FByqMRCA", "title": "Corona topples the American economy and magic turns against the magician?", "text": "“RT” satellite channel is an Arabic-language news media organization affiliated with the independent, non-commercial TV-Novosti Foundation.

But developing cures takes time, and the idea that countries should be discouraged from protecting themselves in the meantime is suicidal. In any case, one of the reasons why Italy, Spain and France were so affected by the coronavirus was the EU's dysfunctional insistence on open borders in the midst of the pandemic.\n\"Global trade and the movement of people\" is all very well, but the pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of the globalist system like never before. Nations will take years to rebuild, and repeating their mistakes is not something they can afford.\nWhile serving as Secretary of State and National Security Adviser under Presidents Nixon and Ford, Kissinger played a leading role in the bombing campaigns against Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos and oversaw regime change operations that placed brutal dictators in the power in Argentina and Chile, too. in support of state-sanctioned repression in Indonesia.

How does a secret international doomsday project that produced weapons with unprecedented murder potential have any bearing on the coronavirus crisis?\nIt must be said that listening to Kissinger is what led to the USA. USA To his current situation: believing himself exceptional, distrusting all the world powers that do not swear absolute fidelity, repeating the same failed policies to the point of parody. With an impending presence in the George W. Bush administration, Kissinger advised the country to head straight into the ever-expanding war on terror, and wrote an editorial in the days after 9/11 that called for taking on \"any government that houses groups capable of this type of attack. « Following that guide has bankrupted the United States and turned it into a banana republic, frantically printing money as its roads and bridges crumble, its citizens struggle to keep a roof over their heads, and the international community gawks, while his government continues to give them a conference on human rights.\nKissinger concludes his Jeremiah with a warning that \"failure [to safeguard the principles of the liberal world order] could set the world on fire\". If, as he himself writes, \"the purpose of the legitimate state is to satisfy the fundamental needs of the people: security, order, economic well-being and justice,\" those principles collapsed long ago. The first step for the United States, after the pandemic, should be to put out the fires caused by Kissinger and those like him who seek to cover up the empire in the rhetoric of liberal democracy.\nThere May Be Retaliation «: Trump Threatens India, Says He Can Face US Anger If Modi Doesn't Repeal Export Ban On Covid-19 Coronavirus Treatment"}, {"url": "https://arabic.rt.com/health/1094525-%D9%87%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%AB-%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%85-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%8A/", "title": "This is what happened one day in the Soviet Union", "text": "This is what happened one day in the Soviet Union\nthe health\nThe famous Soviet painter Alexei Kukuriken, twice winner of the Stalin Prize from India, returned to Moscow on New Year's Eve 1960, but died of a mysterious illness two days after his return.\n60 years ago and in the early morning on the eve of New Years 1960, a plane arriving from India with Alexei Kukuriken, a painter, landed, and after he had finished crossing the border, he went to his girlfriend, suffering from a slight cough, and did not interest anyone in the winter.\nThe next day the painter went to his family to celebrate with them the New Year, and distributed gifts that he brought to them, but the cough became more severe and his temperature rose, so he had to see the doctors, who admitted him to hospital, then his condition worsened and he died in the evening.\nThe autopsy was revealed in the presence of an anatomist, who immediately announced that the painter had variola vera-smallpox. This disease was actually killing lives in the Middle Ages, but in the Soviet Union it had no effect. Because it was eliminated by universal vaccination in 1936. But it is still present in India, and there the painter was infected, during the burning ceremony of a person who died with smallpox.\nAfter diagnosing the cause of death, the doctors discovered the nurse, the doctor who examined the painter in the hospital, and another patient in one of the corridors of the lower floor, as well as a hospital worker. After two weeks, they all had pain-like symptoms (fever, cough, and rash). The smallpox virus was discovered in a sample taken from the skin of a patient. This indicates that an untreated epidemic will hit Moscow and the entire Soviet Union.\nTherefore, in an emergency meeting held on the same day in the presence of Khrushchev, comprehensive measures and measures were taken to prevent the spread of the epidemic.\nThe police and the State Security Committee were charged with exposing all the injured as soon as possible, from the moment the plane carrying the sick painter was landing. That is, this includes all passengers, crew, and workers at the airport, as well as his colleagues, relatives, friends and lover as well. The police, the State Security Committee and the Ministry of Health were able to collect all of them and completely isolate them and all those who contacted the painter and them during this period.\nThe isolation also included workers in stores and other service facilities who had been in contact with the painter’s relatives and sweetheart and were also isolated, and all the gifts and clothes that the painter brought from India were burned.\nThe hospital has turned into a total blockade, and none of the patients, the doctors, and all the staff can leave it for any reason. The hospital was provided with all necessary medicines, equipment, clothes and food. A plane that was on a flight to Paris was also returned to the airport, as one of the passengers on board the aircraft that carried the painter from India to Moscow was on board.\nAmong the measures that were taken to prevent the spread of the epidemic, Moscow closed and completely isolated it according to the laws of wartime, all flights and the movement of trains and cars were stopped, and the medical teams were working day and night and they were isolating every suspect in the hospital, where the number of 10 thousand people a week later had contacted Somehow the plane passengers come from India.\nMeanwhile, the campaign to vaccinate the population with an anti-smallpox vaccine began in the country, where within three days health institutions in Moscow received 10 million vaccines against smallpox from the Tomsk and Tashkent Vaccine and Vaccine Institutes and the Krasnodar Regional and Epidemiological Health Station, where all the residents of Moscow and its guests were vaccinated.\nIn the end, it became clear that 7 of Kokorikin's relatives, 9 hospital staff and 3 hospital patients only had smallpox, and these were the cause of injury to 23 people, of whom only three died.\nDuring this preventive campaign, 7 million Moscow residents and guests were vaccinated. The campaign was carried out by 10,000 medical teams, which included, in addition to doctors and nurses, students of medical institutes.\nWithin one month, the health authorities managed to completely eliminate smallpox.

They force to anchor the infected aircraft carrier, which served to contain China in the Pacific, and is replaced by another attack aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman, which was off the coast of Iran. Which fragilely leaves the US military presence in the Middle East when it has just closed its large Taqaddum air base in Iraq.\nIt is no small matter that the pandemic has reached the US Navy when, apparently, the COVID-19 infected the crews of four aircraft carriers, including the famous Nimitz.\nAir Force General John Hyten, deputy director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Board, said the Pentagon was ready to operate in a \"COVID environment.\"\nAt today's cash cut, the Pentagon says there are more than 3,100 infected and 64 hospitalized out of the 1.4 million service members.\nOne thing is clear: the Pentagon will not be stopped in its military deployments by COVID-19.\nAnd for the avoidance of doubt, Pentagon Undersecretary David Norquist emphasized that the infected aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt remains in a \"state of combat\", even though it anchored at the Guam base - in Micronesia, in the western Pacific - by \" caution\".\nFormer Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly - an entrepreneur who was the manager of the controversial global accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers - stated that although the crew of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt is reduced to 1,000 out of 5,000 it would still constitute a unit willing to intervene militarily. .\nIf this is the case, discarding its hollow bravado, what is the reason, then, that the other USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier has been withdrawn from the coast off Iran to be redeployed in the Pacific instead of the infected carrier?\nPrecisely in the Pacific region, the US has deployed its aircraft carriers in order to intimidate China, including by nuclear means.\nBeyond Modley's bluster, the actual crash of the affected and infected USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier forced the redeployment of the other USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier to take its place.\nSince March 27, the Daily Mail, very close to British MI6, had exposed that, in addition to the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is located in the port of Tokyo, had \"quarantined all its crew \"So China now appears to have its hands free in the Pacific.\"\nHas the major scandal of the USS Theodore Roosevelt served to cover up the quarantine of the other USS Ronald Reagan, practically hidden?\nIt is unknown whether either or both of the crews of the two Chinese aircraft carriers exhibit any COVID-19 infection.\nNow, of the 11 US aircraft carriers, the current greatest maritime superpower, it is striking that another, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, is deployed in the Middle East, while the USS Gerald R. Ford, commissioned by Trump, It is expected to be deployed in 2022.\nThe situation of the other six aircraft carriers that are anchored on the two coasts of the US is as follows:\n- USS Carl Vinson, stationed in Washington state and with a Marine who tested positive for COVID-19;\n- USS Nimitz, stationed in Washington State and with reports of some infected;\n- USS Abraham Lincoln, parked in San Diego;\n- USS George Washington, stationed in Newport (Virginia) and currently under repair;\n- USS John C.

Ford, commissioned by Trump, is expected to be deployed in 2022.\nIt is striking that at least three aircraft carriers are under repair, which significantly reduces the US naval power, even more so when at least three aircraft carriers have been hit by the pandemic.\nStrange things have happened in the US Navy, such as when the collision between the USS Fitzgerald and USS John S.

Such a loud statement on the eve was made by the President of Serbia, Alexander Vucic. In his opinion, the only country that can help Serbia in this situation is China. And he promised to “thank” the EU for such support.\nUS will not lift sanctions so easily - political analyst on Iran’s request >>\nSputnik Azerbaijan asked the associate professor of political science and sociology at the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, a member of the expert council of the Russian Officers and military analyst Alexander Perendzhiev, about what is happening today with Europe and where solidarity is constantly declared there.\n- To begin with, what is your overall attitude to coronavirus? You, as a military expert, admit that this may be a kind of biological weapon, or such a version from the field of conspiracy theories?\n- I am sure that coronavirus is a biological weapon and is spreading in the world primarily by artificial means. And then, through people infected with it, it is transmitted to others.\nIf coronavirus is the result of the fact that in China \"they eat something wrong,\" it turns out that they eat it wrong in Italy. I believe that the problem of coronavirus is not only a health problem. It is simultaneously a military and law enforcement problem.\nThat is, we are talking about distribution agents of coronavirus around the world. And, above all, in developed states. Therefore, it is necessary not only to urgently treat people, but also to identify the foci and pathways of the spread of the virus, and ultimately, the spreading agents, that is, in fact, sabotage pests.\nFor these purposes, it is necessary to create Coronavirus Centers for Countering Coronavirus in all countries, which should include departments for monitoring its spread and, most importantly, anti-virus investigation bureaus.\nThere is no doubt about the need for anti-crisis measures - Assistant to the President >>\nThe task of the latter should be a thorough investigation of specific cases of infection, identifying their causes and conditions. And, of course, the identification of sabotage agents in the spread of the virus.\n- What is happening in Europe today? EU countries have already shown the whole world a complete lack of solidarity, and this is only pneumonia, but what if the war? It turns out that Europe is not ready for anything?\n- The fact is that Europe has never been prepared to counter real threats. I and other Russian experts constantly warned Western, and, above all, European countries about the greater harm they spent on countering the mythical \"Russian\" threat of large assets, forces, human and other resources, as a result of which they would be completely helpless in repelling a real threat. Unfortunately, our forecast came true.\nThe spread of the coronavirus is very reminiscent of a terrorist threat, since in both cases it instills fear, horror, and panic in citizens.\nHowever, the terrorist threat is more tangible, since it comes from specific performers armed with explosives, bombs and other weapons. Here, the enemy is more reminiscent of the plot from Herbert Wells's Invisible Man book. But this must also be able to courageously and skillfully counteract.\nNevertheless, European leaders, instead of reassuring their citizens and declaring their plans and measures taken to prevent the spread of coronavirus, are themselves subject to panic.\nOf course, they have so boldly fought the non-existent Russian threat for so long that they absolutely do not understand how to deal with a specific viral threat. Moreover, in the absence of any instructions \"from above\".\nIs there a threat to Azerbaijani-Russian relations? Pritchin answers >>\nNow in the Russian expert community they even joke about how easy it is now to capture a frightened Europe! But this is only a joke. But seriously, we must unite with Europe in the fight against the spread of infection by creating joint Centers for the fight against coronavirus, of which I spoke above.\n- Given the massive closure of borders, the conclusion suggests itself that the Defender 2020 exercises are in question. Is it likely that they may not take place? And are they needed in principle, if European countries have already shown everything to everyone?\n“Defender 2020, as I said, is a defense exercise against a non-existent threat. I would like to advise our “partners” to pay attention to the antiviral exercises of the radiation chemical and biological defense troops (RCHB) of the Russian Armed Forces.\nDuring them, new RXM-6 reconnaissance chemical machines and ARS-14 auto-filling stations were tested, designed to identify the biological threat at the initial stage and to take the necessary measures to localize and eliminate the consequences of a viral infection.\nMaybe now it makes sense in this form to conduct such exercises? Or maybe, together with Russia?"}, {"url": "https://www.sarayanews.com/article/608198", "title": "New conspiracy: Bill Gates is behind the spread of Corona", "text": "16-04-2020 02:24 AM\nRoger Stone suggested on Monday that Bill Gates might have had a hand in creating the Corona virus and spreading the pandemic throughout the world.\nFormer Donald Trump adviser indicated that American billionaire Bill Gates might have done this so he could grow microchips in people's heads to distinguish who was tested for COVID-19 and not tested.\nStone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM waves, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: \"Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate.\"\nHe added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to sow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations.\nAccording to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is linked to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain \"mandatory vaccinations.\"\nStone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations.\nGates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis such as coronaviruses, to the extent of recent talk about Gates's prediction of the disease 3 years ago.\nAs the Washington Times reported, Gates announced earlier this month that his charitable organization would invest billions of dollars in factories that would focus on developing many vaccines."}, {"url": "https://www.emaratyah.ae/1566709.html", "title": "Corona's plot: Is Bill Gates behind the spread of the virus around the world?

So Kay Bailey Hutchinson commented on the actions of the Russian military in Italy and Russia's humanitarian assistance to the United States. Somewhere from these words the Baltic countries cried, for which membership in NATO without Russia in the image of a common enemy has no benefit.\n“Now is the time of the humanitarian crisis, the health crisis. Any help we can provide to each other, we must provide, ”said US Permanent Representative at NATO Headquarters Kay Bailey Hutchinson during a telephone briefing from Brussels.\nAccording to Hutchinson, \"if we can, we have the opportunity to help each other, we must and will (help).\"\nSo the American diplomat answered the question of whether she is embarrassed that the Russian radiation, chemical and biological defense forces are carrying out a humanitarian operation in a NATO member country - Italy?\nWashington may be embarrassed by this, but the US envoy will not oppose it after US President Donald Trump asked Vladimir Putin. At the Kennedy airport, a Russian military plane with humanitarian aid has already landed, and the rescue mission of the Russian Armed Forces on the streets of New York every day becomes as relevant as in Bergamo.\nIn such circumstances, America cannot demand because of the NATO allies not to forget about the “Russian threat” because of the pandemic.\nTherefore, the United States believes that NATO and Russia should unite against the coronavirus.\nThe State Department’s latest statements regarding Russia have sinned with pro-Russian notes that were not there in the past 10 years. “Both countries provided humanitarian assistance to each other during the crisis in the past and will undoubtedly do so in the future. This is the time to work together to overcome the common enemy that threatens the life of each of us, ”says, for example, a message from the US Foreign Ministry on April 2.\nAt the same time, the State Department emphasizes that Russia is reducing its nuclear potential, and faster than the United States.\nSuch recognition creates diplomatic ground for negotiations between Putin and Trump on the extension of the strategic offensive arms limitation treaty (START-3), which the American side has so far refused.\nNATO as an instrument of pressure on Russia in the new conditions is temporarily irrelevant. Moreover, the North Atlantic Alliance is inadequate as a means of combating the epidemic. In recent weeks, the military-political bloc has shown its complete futility. In Italy, in Spain and further everywhere.\nDirecting NATO forces to fight the coronavirus is a self-evident solution. However, allies on both sides of the Atlantic alone are unable to cope with COVID-19. Practice has shown that non-Western countries fight the pandemic much more effectively than Western countries.\nTherefore, combining efforts with Russia is expedient and profitable. So it is possible to save human lives and prove that the existence of NATO makes sense.\nHowever, there is one interested party, which unites the efforts of Russia and NATO across the throat. This is the Baltic states.\nMembership in NATO is beneficial to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia only if the North Atlantic Alliance is aimed at confronting Russia - this is the only concept for the existence of NATO, in which the Baltic States can count on the influx of money and investment.\nIf the probable adversary of NATO is not Russia, but someone else - Islamic terrorism, coronavirus, it doesn’t matter - the rich allies lose all reason to invest in the Baltic countries. To develop their infrastructure: repair roads and build bridges. Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn will only have to demonstrate discipline, increase military spending ... and not get anything in return.\nMeanwhile, lobbying for financial injections into the Baltic states for military purposes is ongoing. Just the other day, the American Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) released a report stating that NATO troops will not be able to quickly repel Russian aggression in the Baltic states, as the dilapidated road infrastructure in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia limits the speed of movement of military equipment. The conclusion is obvious: do not hide your money!\nThe Baltic countries themselves knocked out the “military Schengen” program in Brussels for several years. The goal is the same - the modernization of the transport network for the accelerated movement of NATO troops. Financing - from the funds of the European Union.\nEven before the epic with the coronavirus, Western Europe showed the Baltic application “nevermind”: in the draft seven-year budget of the EU, funding for the “military Schengen” program was cut to zero.\nNow the United States also stabbed the Baltic allies in the back, urging NATO to unite with Russia in the fight against coronavirus.\nOf course, Russia can help the Baltic countries in the fight against coronavirus. They can now accept this help: \"the elder ordered.\" But for Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn, this is little consolation. If at all consolation: still, what good, they are occupying ... What can we say about the long term. The Baltic countries for the West in isolation from the \"Russian threat\" simply do not exist. And because of this damn coronavirus, the West simply “scored” both the “Russian threat” and the Baltic states."}, {"url": "https://www.elwassat.com/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%B5%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%A7/", "title": "Report: New conflict 'US military may have transferred corona to the Chinese Wuhan", "text": "A report published on the Canadian website concluded that the United States may stand without intentionally causing the emergence of the new Corona virus \"Covid-19\" in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\nAnd a former Professor at the University of Shanghai, Larry Romanov, stated in a report published by the Canadian Globalresearch, that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered last summer to close a large military biological laboratory at Fort Detrick base in Maryland, in anticipation of possible leaks.\nAfter the move, the United States last August witnessed a wave of pneumonia and similar diseases, and this was attributed to the repercussions of electronic cigarettes, but this hypothesis raised the suspicions of some experts.\nAfter that, media and activists in China reported that five of the Americans who participated in the international military games competitions hosted by Wuhan last October were infected with unspecified infection.\nChinese sources suggested that this mysterious disease was in fact \"Covid-19\", which he transferred to Wuhan, an American military, and he may have been infected by an accident not announced in Fort Detrick, and he was not diagnosed because of the absence of any concrete symptoms."}, {"url": "https://www.eshraag.com/1.7.89/204550.html", "title": "Report: US military may transfer SK to Chinese Wuhan", "text": "A report published on the Canadian website concluded that the United States may stand unintentionally behind the emergence of the new Corona virus \"Covid-19\" in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\nAnd a former Professor at the University of Shanghai, Larry Romanov, stated in a report published by the Canadian Globalresearch, that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered last summer to close a large military biological laboratory at Fort Detrick base in Maryland, in anticipation of possible leaks.\nAfter the move, the United States last August witnessed a wave of pneumonia and similar diseases, and this was attributed to the repercussions of electronic cigarettes, but this hypothesis raised the suspicions of some experts.\nAfter that, media and activists in China reported that five of the Americans who participated in the international military games competitions hosted by Wuhan last October were infected with unspecified infection.\nChinese sources suggested that this mysterious disease was in fact \"Covid-19\", which he transferred to Wuhan, an American military, and he may have been infected by an accident that was not announced in Fort Detrick, and he was not diagnosed because of the absence of any concrete symptoms.\nSource: Globalresearch +, Russian Channel One\nFollow RT on\nYou also find the indication that the news report: US military may have transferred SK to Chinese Wuhan has already been published on RT Arabic (Russia Today) and was quoted by the Ishraq News team and the original source is concerned with the validity of the news or not and we are happy to communicate with us through our channels on social media Or from the contact us page.\nFares Al-Zahrani\nEditor in the newspaper, Ishraq Al-Alam, to communicate on e-mail [email protected]\nSubscribe to the newsletter to get the most important news as soon as it is published\nFollow us on social media"}, {"url": "http://antifashist.com/item/ukraina-skryvaet-nalichie-koronovirusa-chtoby-izbezhat-paniki-naseleniya.html", "title": "Ukraine hides the presence of coronavirus to avoid population panic", "text": "Ukraine hides the presence of coronavirus to avoid panic of the population\nThe coronavirus came to Ukraine, but authorities are hiding this information from citizens in order to avoid panic and the recurrence of “New Sanjar”. Two experts wrote about this in social networks at once - Mikhail Chaplyga and Yuri Tkachev.\nAt the same time, Chaplyga drew attention to the fact that recently in Ukraine the mortality from pneumonia, which, as you know, was the first to be affected by the “Wuhan plague”, has increased 4-6 times. Moreover, the political scientist notes, European neighbors want to close the borders with Ukraine, knowing that it is a hotbed of coronovirus: after all, Ukraine has not even entered the network of countries with official testing!\nHowever, Mikhail Chaplyga believes that only tuberculosis, the epidemic of which swept Ukraine, is worse than the coronovirus - and from April 1 all tuberculosis dispensaries will be closed in the country, and carriers of Koch’s sticks will simply be thrown out into the street. “Also take an interest in tuberculosis ... You will mature and run away from the country even without belongings,” he assures.\n“At the same time, medical officials cheerfully“ build for millions ”such as sterile boxes in old and virus-filled hospitals ... Stupidly making money from hysteria: they sell masks and other thermometers. They chop cabbage. And Zelensky knows about this - he is either afraid or in share. This is a very serious mafia, ”the political scientist said. This is confirmed by the fact that the Minister of Health Zoryana Skaletskaya will retain her post, although a ministerial shake-up will take place in the Cabinet on March 4, and a number of officials will lose their portfolios. But Zoryan Skaletskaya, who more than once confirmed the course towards the continuation of the medical reform named after Suprun, was forbidden to touch the external curators. The fact that they are trying to hide the presence of a coronavirus in the country was written in his TG channel by the editor of the Odessa Timer, Yuri Tkachev, after a conversation with a senior medical official.\n“I ask him a question: but it will not be possible to hide the beginning of the coronavirus epidemic in the country? Even as possible, the interlocutor assured me. How exactly? Yes, like that, to say that there are no patients and that’s all.\nBut will the sick be? Will be. But how to prove that they are sick with coronavirus, and not, say, a severe form of influenza? Only with the help of special tests that you can’t buy at the pharmacy, and which only the authorities have. And the authorities will tell you what your test result is, and you have the coronavirus or just the flu.\nBut why hide it? I ask. And in order to avoid panic. Judge for yourself. Some 65,000 people got sick in Wuhan. The population of Wuhan is 11 million people. The population of Odessa is one million people. We divide 65,000 by 11 - we get somewhere around 6,000 potential patients in Odessa. In the boxes of the infectious diseases hospital - 60 beds. Well, you get it, right? And in order to mask their inability to restrain the spread of infection, they will pretend that it does not exist at all. Here everyone has, but we do not. Absolutely no. Maybe then, for the species, 1-2-10 patients will be shown, so as not to get too scorched, ”the journalist writes. And he himself admits that he does not believe in such conspiracy theories for one simple reason: with a Ukrainian mess to crank up such a hoax so that there are no leaks is unrealistic.\n“But there is such a version. The criterion will be the appearance of tests for coronavirus in the regions, and eventually, in free sale. But - at least in the regions.

An exciting report that throws oil on the fire of \"conspiracy theory\"", "text": "The controversy over the origin of the new coronavirus (Corona) has not subsided since it broke out in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, killing thousands and wounding about a quarter of a million people around the world.\nThis controversy escalated, especially between the United States and China, to the highest levels, as US President Donald Trump described it as a Chinese virus, while Beijing suspected that he was an American.\nAlthough scientists and specialists are now busy combating this deadly epidemic, regardless of its source, and some confirm that there are no indications of its creation and that it is a \"natural\" virus known \"lineage\", it was exposed to a mutation that turned it into a \"killer\" that has the ability to penetrate human cells, except A report published by the American journal, Nature, known for its sobriety, still threw more oil on \"conspiracy theory\" oil.\nThis report was published on November 12, 2015, and reported that US scientists have created in the laboratory a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats in connection with a virus that causes SARS, that is, acute respiratory syndrome.\nThe magazine showed about 5 years ago that scientists had examined a virus called \"SHC014\", which was found in horseshoe bats in China.\nThese scientists combined the surface protein of \"SHC014\" with the SARS virus, and came out with a new virus that provided the surface protein with a structure that helps it penetrate the cells of the human respiratory system. It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\nIn this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans.\nResearchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than previously thought.\"\nOn the other hand, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify \"potential risks\".\nSimon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: \"If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.\"\nIn October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on \"job promotion\", especially those that cause serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans.\nSource: NATURE"}, {"url": "https://www.masralyoum.net/Egypt-Today/1362662/%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AA%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B9-%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B6%D8%AF-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7", "title": "Russia announces the end of the first phase of work to manufacture a vaccine against SK", "text": "The head of the Russian Medical and Biological Agency, Veronica Skvortsova, announced today, Monday, that the agency's work to develop a vaccine against the emerging corona virus \"Covid 19\" has passed its first stage.\nWhile the headquarters of anti-Corona Virus operations in Russia announced today, Monday, that the Corona virus detection test was conducted on more than 165 thousand people, and more than 72 thousand people are still under medical supervision because of the suspected infection with the virus.\nA representative of the Russian \"Azure-Air\" company announced that a special flight of the company took off to Morocco to evacuate Russian citizens from there in light of the spread of the \"Corona\" virus.\nVyacheslav Eileen, head of the department of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, believes that the SK virus is not excluded from falling into a meteorite on Chinese soil.\nThe Russian Civil Aviation Authority announced that all flights between Russia and foreign countries will be stopped from midnight, except for regular flights from Moscow to the capitals of other countries or big cities, and charter flights to return Russian citizens to their homeland, according to the government's mandate issued on March 20.\nNote: The content of this news was written by the seventh day and does not express Egypt's point of view today, but was conveyed with its content as it is from the seventh day and we are not responsible for the content of the news and the custody of the previous source is a memory."}, {"url": "https://de.news-front.info/2020/01/25/massenepidemie-in-china-coronavirus-eine-neue-entwicklung-aus-den-biolaboren-des-pentagon/", "title": "Mass Epidemic in China: Coronavirus - A New Development from the Pentagon's Bio Laboratories?", "text": "Coronavirus, a fatal lung disease, is currently spreading in China. To date, 41 deaths have been reported by Friday and more than 1,300 people have been infected with the virus. The virus has also reached Europe and the United States, and has so far spread rapidly in China. Since 2017, it has been known that the Pentagon operates organic laboratories worldwide that are located on the borders of Russia, China and Iran.\nTherefore, it can at least now not be ruled out that the United States released the virus on arch-enemy China in order to test its deadly virus on humans or even simply want to kill a large number of people. In the past few years, the United States has established itself as the number 1 mass murderer, which establishes entire terrorist militias such as Al Qaeda or IS across borders, before rushing to help as a rescuer from terrorism as a global police force.\nIn view of these connections, such a presumption of spreading deadly viruses in China and around the world is initially an \"abstruse conspiracy theory\" for the US-owned western press, but it is not far-fetched.\nIn 2018, it was revealed that the United States has a bio-weapons program in Georgia that is hermetically shielded from the outside world and not under the control of international organizations. There are also another dozen such laboratories in Ukraine, where biological weapons such as deadly viruses are tested on humans as if they were laboratory rats.\nThe 2019 nCoV virus targets the airways and causes cough, fever and difficulty breathing. Liquid can be drained from the lungs, the airways can be cleaned and dilated, and oxygen can be released through the mask. However, these are just ways to relieve the symptoms.\nAntibiotics are useless against viruses - if you have a virus, the doctor tells you to rest a lot and gives you a lollipop. Antibiotics only help against Bak Against a virus, your body's immune system is your only line of defense. The only real protection against external viruses is vaccines, but their development can take a long time and are not always effective. When the virus mutates and the vaccine becomes unusable, it happens with influenza almost every winter when doctors play a guessing game about which strains of flu will spread this year.\nSome have speculated that 2019-nCoV is actually a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that killed nearly 800 people across Asia in 2002. DNA analysis of 2019-nCoV showed that it is very similar to SARS - essentially a modified form. However, Chinese officials are trying to distance this new bug from SARS. Perhaps they fear that the name will panic the public. So far, the message \"Keep Calm and Carry On\" appeared to be in effect - commuters in Beijing were not overly concerned about 2019 nCoV, although five cases were confirmed there.\nAnd of course there is a «conspiracy theory» on Wikipedia about the SARS epidemic in China that you shouldn't believe in. Not because the United States' biological weapons program could have anything to do with it. However, new insights into the United States' biological weapons program came to light about 15 years after the epidemic. In this respect, it is not far-fetched that Pentagon is testing its weapons on Chinese, of whom the US regime believes there are more than enough anyway.

Surrounded by President Vladimir Zelensky, panic is not hidden. According to the deputy of the Verkhovna Rada from the party “Servant of the People”, Alexander Dubinsky, the country is about to default, as it is impossible to repay the amount of debts that Kiev has without global financial assistance.\nAccording to the people's representative, Kiev has neither an economic strategy for the country's survival without the help of the International Monetary Fund, nor a plan for the existence of Ukraine in connection with the situation with coronavirus. “Are there conditions for Ukraine’s survival in the context of the global financial and economic crisis?” No. What are you talking about, what kind of masks ... Not a damn thing, there are no bugs, no food, no canned food. The state reserve is empty at all ... ”- Dubinsky panicked, recalling that Ukraine imports the vast majority of products. True, I was afraid to say that there was no longer a neighbor who always pulled out of the pit in the most difficult times. But only “feed wheat, the crop of which has not yet ripened,” is available.\nAs if in confirmation of Dubinsky's words, the National Bank Nezalezhnaya made a statement. There is an acute shortage of cash in the country, the regulator said. The population in droves rushed to buy green banknotes, not backed up by anything, except for the giant US public debt. “In recent days, we have seen signs of a shortage of cash at the banks’ cash desks. <...> Due to the cessation of air transportation and the closure of borders, cash dollars and euros are being delivered to Ukraine with a delay, ”the National Bank said in a statement, financiers who tried to calm the population calmly supposedly , $ 8 billion of non-cash currency is concentrated on correspondent accounts of banks in the country, and customers can freely convert and transfer money to their accounts in other banks. But such exhortations are useless when people try to \"correctly\" invest the rest of their savings.\nHowever, Zelensky still hopes for a miracle, that the situation is normalizing. He took his hat and went with outstretched hand to the oligarchs, perhaps they would save. Another thing is that in return these gentlemen will ask a lot of things. But, as they say, after us at least a flood. To begin with, under the pretext of combating coronavirus, the guarantor persuaded Ukrainian businessmen to part with $ 500 million, since “it was time to help the country” after it “fed” the business for a long time. Money, of course, will go to a separate fund organized by the government. With the allocated funds Zelensky promised to buy medical equipment, protective and disinfectants. At the same time, it is noteworthy that there were no instructions from the NSDC, SBU, the State Security Service and the Prosecutor General’s Office to sort out and report which officials were involved in the illegal export of protective equipment, who failed the test systems support program, why the Ukrgosrezerv does not have the necessary supply of medical masks.\nBut the guarantor put everyone home. Most importantly, in order to avoid the Maidan, he transferred Kiev to a state of siege, so that the people would starve separately and not go out with forks against the authorities. Now citizens will not be able to get together more than 10 people. From tomorrow, passenger rail, bus and air transportation within the country will be stopped. Moreover, in Ukrainian cities the metro stops working. The rest of the city transport will continue to function, but with limitations. Transportation in minibuses, trolleybuses and buses can only be carried out if there are up to 20 people in the cabin.\nBy what miracle the Ukrainian authorities will be able to control this with an idle subway, etc., when crowds rush to besiege single buses, trolleybuses and trams - it is incomprehensible to the mind. They promise, of course, that police will follow the number of citizens. But where to get so many law enforcement officers? With them, as you know, the country is tense. Obviously the obstinate mayor of Kharkov, Gennady Kernes, did not understand everything. He has already refused to stop the subway, saying that he does not agree with the position of the president, he is against and is not going to close the metro.\nTo this, the guarantor hastened to transfer all responsibility for the distribution of the coronavirus to Kernes, saying that every patient in Kharkov is on the conscience of the mayor. And even threatened the bunks for disobedience. “I will say this very carefully: if he breaks the law, and he begins to do it, then he will personally face criminal liability,” promised Zelensky, who, in addition to punishing the Shrew, has a lot more to do, for example, checking the shelves. The people, although they are mostly impoverished, get their money for essential goods from somewhere, wonderfully replenish their stocks, and stores eventually become empty. Not an order. Yes, and the sale of Ukrainian land should be dealt with closely, while citizens can not participate in mass protests in view of the impending epidemic."}, {"url": "http://lomazoma.com/world-news/1553713.html", "title": "The page is not available", "text": "Sorry, the page you are trying to reach is not available.

However, a few Twitter detectives discovered on Wednesday that these “professionals” don’t seem to have all the necessary licenses and qualifications to practice medicine in the US either.\nAt the urging of his state medical advisors, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak banned the use of FDA-approved malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat coronavirus in an emergency order issued on Tuesday.\nThe order tightly restricts supply of the drugs, limiting even non-coronavirus cases to a 30-day supply. Sisolak, a Democrat, explained it was a safety measure to prevent hoarding of the malaria medicines and ensure continued supply to the patients who desperately need them.\nPushing the loudest for the restrictions had been Ihsan Azzam, Nevada’s chief medical officer. While Azzam has a masters degree and prior experience in environmental public health and epidemiology, fulfilling the qualifications required to hold the state post, his only experience actually practicing medicine came from an obstetrics and gynecology department in an African hospital over two decades ago.\nTurns out Nevada’s chief medical officer is not even licensed to practice medicine in the US.

It’s not clear how many malaria patients Nevada typically sees in a given year - the mosquito-borne illness is exceedingly rare in the US, and was even declared eliminated in 1951 by the Centers for Disease Control - but the decision to essentially put them ahead of potential coronavirus sufferers raised some eyebrows, especially among Trump supporters familiar with the president’s interest in the drugs.\nNone of Nevada’s disease prevention & epidemiology staff are qualified to make medical decisions related to infectious disease.

While her resume touts her leading roles managing various local disease outbreaks, she lacks even a Masters in Public Health and neither woman appears to have attended medical school.\nMany on social media were shocked that there was not a single practicing medical doctor among the trio, and a petition to recall Sisolak as governor even began gathering momentum.\nCall me old-fashioned, but I feel like someone with either of these titles should have gone to medical school.

Or “Short answers to serious questions” in another translation.\nThe professor was afraid of many things: the visits of evil aliens, the fact that the Earth would overheat and become unsuitable for life, he was afraid of artificial intelligence that would enslave people. He was frightened by the prospect of the appearance of robotic soldiers deprived of any moral hesitation.\nBut most of all the scientist was afraid of nuclear and, most importantly, biological weapons. He predicted the appearance of genetically modified viruses. The scientist was not reassured by the assurances of colleagues, they say, all of \"biology\" - under control. He had no doubt that once some incredibly infectious and indestructible trifle, created artificially, would break out of the laboratory and go to “mow” people. Up to the last man.\nThis is how coronaviruses that attacked humanity look like.\nCoronavirus 2019-nCoV - God forbid, if Stephen Hawking's fear was embodied in it. After all, suspicions of the artificial origin of this malignant trifle, causing unprecedented atypical pneumonia, look completely justified. The infection manifested itself in Wuhan, where in 2018 the Chinese authorities opened the Institute of Virology. Former Israeli intelligence officer Dani Shoham recently said that one of the institute’s laboratories participated in a secret Chinese biological weapons program.\nIt is completely possible that the new coronavirus was developed on the basis of the \"old\" one, which caused the outbreak of SARS in 2002-2003. According to scientists, the genomes of these viruses coincide by 80 percent.\nAnd the most suspicious: emergency measures that the Chinese authorities took immediately after the first 2019-nCoV infected with this appeared. They looked redundant and did not at all correspond to the reassuring statements of physicians from different countries. Like, there’s nothing wrong and never will be. Now defensive measures are even more fearful, but seem appropriate.\nThere are suspicions that the current coronavirus appeared as a result of the creation of biological weapons.\nIt seems that the Chinese from the very beginning were aware of the danger threatening humanity. And they had reason to believe that the “lethal force” and virulence of the new coronavirus would increase as it spreads.\nHow can one not believe the rumors that the 2019-nCoV \"leaked\" from a secret laboratory? And not necessarily in the form of ready-to-use biological weapons. The new coronavirus, which has already killed more than a hundred people, could well be a prototype. Or even a semi-finished product, the antidote for which, apparently, has not yet been created. Otherwise, the Chinese would not cry out for help by sending counterparts from other countries with samples of the genome of this 2019-nCoV.\n... and the lyrics\nThe prophecies of other recognized seers do not seem as obvious. Although quatrain 22 from the First Century of Nostradamus, which has come down to us from the Middle Ages, is quite suitable for the modern situation: \"Destruction and death saddles science, all life will lose both value and meaning.\"\nHowever, this phrase is suitable for much more.\nBaba Wang seems to have foreseen the impending disaster. Back in the 70s of the last century, she predicted at the end of the first decade of this century an epidemic of a new viral disease that would spread rapidly around the world and take many lives. But she said that the epidemic would begin in China, pointed to Africa. She promised that it would take a whole year to create a vaccine against the new virus. This, surprisingly, is in good agreement with current medical forecasts.\nVanga made a mistake on the continent's prophecy. \"Saw\" the beginning of the epidemic in Africa.\nIt was as if billionaire Bill Gates and his wife Melinda knew about the prophecy of Wang. Recently, they (the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) have allocated $ 10 million to Africa specifically - to emergency funds for those who are trying to keep 2019-cNoV from spreading across the black continent.\nGennady Onishchenko: China is a Mecca for the production of new diseases\nFRONT SUMMARY\nOn January 29, according to official figures, 6057 people were infected with the new coronavirus.

And how did the virus pass to a US aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean ?!", "text": "How did the American military transport Corona to the Chinese Wuhan? .. And how did the virus pass to a US aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean ?!\nA report published on the Canadian website concluded that the United States may stand unintentionally behind the emergence of the new Corona virus \"Covid-19\" in the Chinese city of Wuhan. And a former Professor at the University of Shanghai, Larry Romanov, stated in a report published by the Canadian Globalresearch, that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered last summer to close a large military biological laboratory at Fort Detrick base in Maryland, in anticipation of possible leaks. After the move, the United States last August witnessed a wave of pneumonia and similar diseases, and this was attributed to the repercussions of electronic cigarettes, but this hypothesis raised the suspicions of some experts. After that, media and activists in China reported that five of the Americans who participated in the international military games competitions hosted by Wuhan last October were infected with unspecified infection. Chinese sources suggested that this mysterious disease was in fact \"Covid-19\", which he transferred to Wuhan, an American military, and he may have been infected by an accident that was not announced in Fort Detrick, and he was not diagnosed because of the absence of any concrete symptoms.\nHas the virus been transmitted to USS Roosevelt from an American military crew that it visited coming from another ship?\nAs of March 30, 2020, the number of US soldiers infected with the new Corona virus on board the giant USS Roosevelt aircraft carrier, 8 sailors, according to the official recognition of the US Navy, while the American network ABC reported 36 cases, Quoted from a military official, who declined to be identified. We are not talking here about a cruise ship with 200 passengers and the countries of the world refuse to receive it, but rather one of the largest pieces that humans have built with a length of 332 meters, carrying 3,200 naval soldiers and 2480 pilot soldiers. And most of all, it was until a few days that it moved from one port to another in the Gulf, where its personnel dock and exit to participate in many activities in the allied countries hosting joint programs. Just a few days ago, the US Navy decided to adjust the carrier's agenda and itinerary to head to Guam Island, the strategic location of US forces, with the aim of conducting checks for its crew. The reported cases of injuries among soldiers do not include an unspecified number of quarantined people on board the carrier, knowing that sterilization on a ship of this size is complex. More importantly, stopping the spread of the virus requires its evacuation completely, with only 800 devices available for corona testing in the carrier's medical team. But the most important for the countries in which it was docked is the identification of the persons who communicated with its crew, as well as the determination of the \"zero\", a measure that is almost impossible due to the secrecy surrounding the medical examinations that the sailors will be subjected to, according to the protocol in force in the US Navy. The USS Roosevelt carrier claims that it headed to the Indian-Pacific shared area on January 17, 2020, on a mission that was supposed to last 7 months, first dressed in the port of Da Nang in Vietnam, where New cases of coronavirus infection are currently being discovered (in the port itself and the town in which it is located), knowing that Vietnam was completely empty, and for 22 days, from any local infection, until multiple infections appeared through British tourists in the same town where they docked. USS Roosevelt \"for two weeks. The “mystery” of the spread of the epidemic on the carrier in light of the great American discretion cannot be answered, especially since the number of injuries may rise dramatically due to the ventilation mechanism on the carrier and the narrow living spaces allocated to the sailors, with an excess of the number of surfaces, such as stairs, door handles and narrow paths Between the rooms, and the presence of shared bathrooms, note that the sailors spend a large part of their time examining all parts of the carrier, with a view to ensuring their availability throughout. The Americans insist on talking about the appearance of corona symptoms between soldiers 15 days after visiting Vietnam, while the poor country, Southeast Asia, did not witness any case of corona before visiting the US aircraft carrier, so did the virus pass to \"USS Roosevelt\" from a crew An American soldier visited from another ship? This is the most likely answer, especially since time did not help the carrier to move to other ports, and the only friction he experienced was her sailors, who was in the high ocean during joint exercises with other American parts."}, {"url": "https://annabaa.org/arabic/health/22748", "title": "How to strengthen your immunity during the Corona virus pandemic?", "text": "The spread of the Corona virus caused panic in many countries of the world, and precautionary measures were taken, including attention to raising the immune system, which plays a major role in protecting the body from viruses.\nDoctors and researchers are still betting on the ability of the human body to deal with the deadly disease, through the human autoimmune system, in light of the delay in the emergence of a successful treatment or a vaccine against the emerging corona virus, the current viral pandemic is mysterious. Many questions go through the minds of many, such as did you catch the virus? Do I have it now? Did I have immunity to it? Was your cough a few weeks ago a mild infection with the virus or for some other reason? I felt sick, but your temperature did not rise and improved, so do you still have to stay at home?\nIf you suffer from symptoms and you are lucky, a smear will be taken from you to determine whether you have the virus or not, and it may mean that your body produced while you are at home antibodies fighting the virus. If you haven't had a test during your illness and recovered - which is the case for many people, your condition remains unknown because you do not know if you are infected with the virus and may spread it among others. That is why a group of researchers has decided to develop a blood test that reveals the formation of immunity in your body against the virus, according to a Reuters report.\nTo overcome the Corona crisis physically and mentally, one needs strong and robust immunity. To fulfill this requirement, you must do things that will ultimately bring you happiness and strengthen your body's immunity at a time when we need strong immunity, more than ever.\nThe majority of us are in this exceptional situation for the first time due to a virus. And a lot of things seem to be getting out of control. Some habits break up, and no one knows how the situation will last. Thus, the things that we control with our hands seem important to maintain health and strength. The main condition for this is to reduce and strengthen the burden on our immune system, through things that we mention here: healthy eating In fact, it is always important to support the body and the soul with healthy nutrition as possible. And now it is precisely our diet that is important. Healthy eating reduces, as is proven, the risk of chronic diseases such as diseases of the circulatory system, heart, diabetes and obesity, and it also reduces the possibility of depression and a feeling of fear. The best nutrients for our psyche are those that are also healthy for our body. Our brain especially benefits from carbohydrates, as it is available in fruits, vegetables and barley. Energy is slowly excreted from these nutrients. This has a positive impact on our psychological state. The food that strengthens our immune system includes nutrients with a high content of vitamins, especially A and B, in addition to mineral substances such as iron and zinc. B vitamins are abundant in vegetables, eggs, chicken and fish. B vitamins are important for our brain to secrete hormones of happiness. Depression is often caused by a deficiency of B6, B12 and folic acid.\nAnd even the position of the intestine has a strong impact on our psychological feeling and the comfort of our body. Fermentary foodstuffs, such as yoghurt or curd \"yogurt\", have an anti-inflammatory effect and can thus improve our emotional well-being.\nEven the World Health Organization has released a list of advice that helps maintain good physical and mental health. She also talked about what we should give up like consuming tobacco, alcohol or other drugs.\nComfortable sleep, and while we are sleeping, our body continues to work, as the cells regenerate and toxic substances break down and the information is processed and our memory is strengthened. Research has revealed that a lack of sleep has broad implications for our health and negative for our sensory condition and for our emotional intelligence. The lack of sleep also makes us vulnerable to chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease.\nAnd as we follow some habits of eating, working and sports, an equal sleep system is very important. For most people, six to nine hours of sleep is sufficient. Going to bed at the same time and waking up may contribute to maintaining a degree of habit.\nAnd if you are having trouble sleeping, try before going to bed not to see the news even in the time of Corona, and avoid looking at the computer screen, because the blue light for the screens reduces the quality of sleep. What if I hold a book?\nRise, movement immerses our body in happiness hormones, it contributes to improving sleep, reduces stress and fear, and also strengthens our memories and perceptions. Movement and exercise can be done indoors, and specialists recommend 30 minutes per day, either at once or intermittently. The main thing is to get some movement. Fitness trainers now offer online lessons, sometimes for free.\nThere are multiple possibilities to make sports moves, even in the balcony or on the ladder at home. Touring outdoors is also important for health. Since direct communication has diminished these days because of Corona, communication via social media has acquired a great importance and has a positive impact, and since you now have enough time because of your staying at home in the time of Corona, then think about completing those things that you have never had time To accomplish it, such as working in the garden or cooking, then all you have to do in sanitary days is to take advantage of your own energies, which always helped you overcome difficult times.\nHow does immunity inside the body fight the Corona virus?\nAn Australian study found the way the immune system works against corona, as it is able to eliminate the virus in the same way that it works to repel the regular flu. Corona Anti Virus.\nThe researchers discovered the cells by treating a patient who came from Wuhan, China to Australia, and was infected with the virus with a mild to moderate infection. The researchers observed the emergence of certain immune cells in their blood three days before they recovered, and the study found that this type of cell appears Also in people with influenza and at the same stage of the disease, which confirms that those with Corona virus, who do not have severe symptoms, are recovering in the same way as those with normal flu.\nAccording to experts, discovering the type of immune cells that appear after infection with the Coronavirus, may help in developing a vaccine against it, and in identifying the stages of the virus's development, a discovery that experts described as a real scientific breakthrough.\nThe largest drug companies around the world are racing to make a drug capable of conquering the Corona virus, which has killed about 9,000 people and infected more than 220,000 in more than 120 countries. About 50 drugs are being developed and tested to counter the virus, also known as \"Covid 19\", According to the World Health Organization, it has not yet approved any proven treatment for the virus, and there is no vaccine to prevent it.\nThe secret of immunity against corona\nElena Malysheva, the famous Russian doctor and presenter, enumerated some nutrients that are able to boost the body's immunity to fight against the infection of the Corona virus, and during one of its televised medical programs, Malysheva said: \"Food products that contain large amounts of zinc are necessary to activate the so-called killer cells in the body, These cells, according to doctor Andreas Prodius, have the mission to kill other cells infected with the virus. \"\nThe doctor indicated that a person can get this important component from various foods such as oysters, oats and corn flakes, and according to Malysheva, the elderly with diabetes are among the most at risk of corona, due to the symptoms that may cause zinc deficiency in their bodies, which may affect Their immune system work.\nThe doctor advised those suffering from cardiovascular diseases and cancer patients to add the Brazilian nuts to their diet as it contains selenium, which is considered an anti-oxidant and an important component to strengthen the immune system, and also stressed the need to increase drinking water, especially for the elderly, and she explained that dehydration and fluid deficiency helps to Increased concentration of viruses and germs in the body.\nThe treatment is inside you\nWith the delay in the emergence of a successful treatment or preventive vaccine against the emerging corona virus, doctors and researchers are still betting on the ability of the human body to deal with the deadly disease, through the human immune system.\nAn Australian study found the way the immune system works against corona, and concluded that the device is able to eliminate the virus in the same way as it works to repel the regular flu. On fighting against the SK virus.\nThe researchers reached the discovery of the cells by treating a patient who came from Wuhan, China to Australia, and was infected with the virus with a mild to moderate infection. The researchers observed the emergence of certain immune cells in their blood three days before they recovered, and the study found that this type of cell also appears In people with influenza and at the same stage of illness, which confirms that those with coronavirus, who do not have severe symptoms, are recovering in the same way as those with normal flu.\nAccording to experts, discovering the type of immune cells that appear after infection with the Coronavirus, may help in developing a vaccine against it, and in identifying the stages of the virus's development, a discovery that experts described as a real scientific breakthrough.\nThe largest drug companies around the world are racing to make a drug that can defeat the Corona virus, which has killed about 9,000 people and infected more than 220,000 in more than 120 countries. About 50 drugs are being developed and tested to counter the virus, also known as \"Covid 19\", The World Health Organization says it has not yet approved any proven treatment for the virus, and there is no vaccine to prevent it.\nLifestyle enhances the immune system against corona\n1- Fresh lemon every morning\nDrinking a cup of lemon juice diluted with pure water every morning seems an ideal way to start digestion and boost immunity, because it contains vital \"flavonoids\", which are one of the antioxidant compounds that protect the body from pollutants and toxins, and contribute to strengthening immunity.\nOn the other hand, drinking a cup of fresh lemon juice in the morning 15 minutes before breakfast, has been shown to help restore the acid-base balance in the body and maintain its internal balance at the pH level, which supports healthy bacteria instead of harmful viruses and bacteria that reproduce. In more acidic media.\n2- Alkali medium\nThe immune system is at its best when it is in an alkaline medium, and recent studies indicate that the acid medium is a fertile environment for a number of bacteria and viruses, but the latter cannot adapt to a healthy alkaline environment. In this regard, the researchers recommend eating leafy vegetables and drinking large quantities of water to support the alkalinity of the body and its immunity.\n3- Yogurt daily\nEating a cup of bio-yogurt helps prevent infection, because it contains \"probiotics\", the latter being a useful bacterium that stimulates immune cells in the digestive tract, and also helps stimulate the production of immune cells. A study issued by the University of \"Vienna\" in this regard, which dealt with 33 women, revealed that those who consumed a cup of yogurt daily and for two weeks increased the number of lymphocytes that boost immunity by nearly 30%.\n4- The power of raw food\nNutritionists advise eating green vegetables and fresh citrus fruits in snacks, while cooking other foods (eggs, meat and fish) at a low temperature and for a longer period of time, inside pots that are not made from \"aluminum\", because this substance increases the burden of toxins on the immune system.\n5- Eat garlic\nGarlic has immune-enhancing properties because it contains compounds such as \"allicin\" and \"sulfide\" that give it a pungent taste. It is one of the antioxidants that hinders the growth of free radicals in the bloodstream, plays a role in getting rid of other carcinogenic and toxic substances, and prevents the adhesion of blood platelets to each other.\n6- Good sleep\nStudies issued by the American Society of Cardiology show that \"good sleep is linked to the balance of hormone levels, it boosts immunity, maintains the ideal weight, improves mood, and makes the skin more vibrant and healthy ...\".\nOn the other hand, new research dealing with sleep patterns proves that sleeping for only five hours per day increases the risk of dying from heart disease, and the lack of its hours is related to the increased risks of weight gain, diabetes and infectious diseases.\n7- Moderation in exercise\nAs is the case in the diet, moderation is the basic rule, knowing that excessive sports training to the point of exhaustion may increase the secretion of \"adrenaline\" and \"cortisol\", which are two hormones that temporarily suppress the effectiveness of immunity.\nFoods you should avoid at this time\nDoctors and specialists emphasize a list of foods that may weaken the immune system, making it an easy prey for invading the Corona virus, while these specialists emphasize that there are foods that contribute to the transmission of the virus, and doctors stress - according to the \"Al-Hurra\" site and the \"Weiss Americans\" site - the need to have a strong immunity to counter Corona is advised to avoid certain foods and drinks that may weaken the immune system as a result of eating it continuously.\nHere is a list of foods and drinks that the doctor at the American Piedmont Hospital, Samer Blackmon, believes that weakens the human immune system.\nSoda\nSoft drinks, which consist of industrial materials such as preservatives, gases, and flavors.\nProcessed foods\nSuch as white bread, sweetened breakfast cereals, pastries, biscuits, cakes, and fried food such as French fries or potato chips, ice cream, and processed meats.\nSugar-rich foods and foods\nDessert, ice cream, ketchup, white bread, juices, jam, spaghetti sauce, cakes, energy drinks, chocolate milk, garnula, flavored coffee, canned fruit\nTreated carbohydrates\nLike pizza, white rice, desserts, breakfast cereals, corn flakes, baked cakes and cakes, and French fries.\nAlcoholic beverages and cigarettes\nAlthough cigarettes are not food, they weaken the immune system and make them susceptible to disease. On the other hand, Doctor Blackmon said, \"Eating an integrated diet full of vegetables and fruits will give your body the vitamins and minerals it needs to fight diseases.\"\nThe doctor added, \"These foods modify and adjust the body to function at maximum performance. Believe it or not, what you put in your mouth represents one brick to build a strong immune system.\"\nDoes prepared food in restaurants transmit the Corona virus?\nOn the other hand, specialists and medical experts warned - according to the US \"Weiss\" site - that the Corona virus can be transmitted to humans through prepared foods, especially cold meats, vegetables and fruits.\nAnd several researches have proven that the emerging virus lives on surfaces such as plastics and minerals for hours and days, but a new study has shown that foods can also be vectors of the virus, especially humid.\n\"Wet and semi-solid foods are a very appropriate medium for the virus, such as the mouth, and prolong the life of it,\" said Dr. Jacques Caravanos of the New York University Department of Public Health, and according to published reports, several Arab countries have begun distributing instructions to their citizens to avoid disease, including urging them To avoid eating ready-made meals, especially falafel, which is the most popular food in the region, especially Egypt. Caravanos says that foods such as cold meats, vegetables and meals exposed to air are “more vulnerable to contamination with the virus, as it can live in it for about five days.”\nWhat is \"herd immunity\"? Is it enough to counter the Corona virus?\nThe concept of “herd immunity” topped the front again after Britain announced its strategy to counter the outbreak of the new Corona virus in the country, which seemed to aim to push the British to acquire mass immunity against the virus.\nAnd British Prime Minister Burs Johnson announced last week that the government would seek to slow the spread of the virus that causes the disease, rather than stopping it, as part of a mitigation strategy, which assumes that up to 80 percent of people will become infected before becoming vaccinated against the virus in the future. .\nHowever, the British government backed away from that, after scientists warned that this approach could sink the country's health system, as happened in Italy, which could lead to the death of 250 thousand people.\nHow to gain herd immunity ?, according to a report by the South Tina Morning, Azra Ghani, an infectious disease expert at Imperial College London, whose research helped enrich government policy: “We expected to build the herd’s immunity. We now realize that it is not possible to deal However, after recovering from an infectious disease, the body's immune system often \"remembers\" the virus, so it can fight it in the future. Vaccines work on the same principle, by inserting molecules of bacteria or a virus into our bodies, leaving our immune system a memory of disease, without actually getting sick. Herd immunity describes the point where a sufficient number of people are immune to disease, whether through Vaccination or infection.\nAlthough scientists continue to study the current virus, it is not considered infectious with the same proportion of measles, for example, as experts estimate that about 60-70 percent of the population will need to be infected in order to develop immunity to stop its spread.\nWould it be the answer to Corona ?, and many experts believe that most people around the world will eventually become infected with the virus, unless a vaccine is first developed, a process that is expected to take at least 12-18 months. At this point, herd immunity will be a possible positive side effect, although millions will die to achieve this, and although scientists have provided estimates of infection rates, which will be necessary to achieve herd immunity, we do not know whether this The virus will go the same way as other viruses, and Jeremy Rossman, a senior honorary lecturer in virology at Kent University, said, “It is not certain that herd immunity is possible in the case of the Corona virus.” And he added, “Another possibility, is the evolution of the virus, Viruses tend to evolve, which causes us to start again, \"and there Fears that the virus will return more fierce next year, as happened with the Spanish influenza pandemic, which disappeared in the summer months to return in the fall and winter and kills more than before."}, {"url": "https://mediaelbalad.com/arab-and-world/187010", "title": "Accusations of Bill Gates ..

Expert Romanoff named laboratory location\nGlobal Research Canada columnist Larry Romanoff is convinced that the coronavirus was created in the United States. The expert even named the location of the biological weapons laboratory.\nAccording to the journalist, the virus certainly did not appear on the seafood market in Chinese Wuhan - most likely, it was brought there from the outside.\n\"The only possible source of coronavirus origin is the United States, because only this country has all the branches of the evolutionary tree of coronaviruses. The original source of the COVID-19 virus was the US military laboratory in Fort Detrick,\" Romanoff quoted URA.RU.\nThe expert’s findings are based on studies by Japanese and Taiwanese epidemiologists.\nSo, he recalled that in August last year in the United States there was a wave of pneumonia, the source of which the Americans called vapes. Several cases of illness have been fatal.\nThen a doctor from Taiwan warned the United States that the cause of pneumonia could be a coronavirus, but no one listened.\nIn addition, Romanoff notes that just before the outbreak in the United States, for some reason, they closed their main military biolaboratory in Fort Detrick.\nEarlier, other experts also reported that coronavirus was created in the laboratory and specially distributed in China.

And then there is the presidential election in the USA, and it is still unknown whether Donald Trump will be able to gain a foothold in the Oval Office for a second term ... But, it seems, a malicious virus that has matured either in the stomachs of bats, or in a snake's gut, has confused all the cards to a friend Xi Jinping.\nAgainst the backdrop of alarming reports from the Chinese province of Hubei (when this material was being prepared, more than 4.5 thousand people fell ill with pneumonia, and 106 died, and these are not final numbers. - Auth.) Copper and iron ore prices collapsed.\nCopper is getting cheaper for ten days in a row, and yesterday the price fell by 1.5% to $ 5,834.5 per ton. Iron ore futures are falling in price, on Tuesday at the Singapore auction they offered 85 dollars per ton - a decrease of 6.4%. But, as Bloomberg predicts, $ 80 per tonne is not such a distant prospect. Prices for black gold also plummeted - April futures for the North Sea Brent crude mixture were already trading below $ 58 per barrel.\nAt the same time, the Fitch rating agency cautiously reports that the spread of coronavirus will first of all have a negative impact on the economies of Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore, since in these countries the most vulnerable regions to the epidemics are tourism and the service sector. The statement is indisputable - everyone will get it, and yet China, presumably, is more than the others, since it is the Chinese economy that is the main consumer of both metals and energy, and tourism with a service sector is not the last source of replenishment of the treasury. And since the prices of these goods went down, the Chinese economy also caught the “virus”. And it is easier to negotiate with a \"sick\" client, which is well known even without Trump.\nIt is noteworthy that 2019-nCoV got to the American technological giant Apple, whose production facilities are located just 500 kilometers from the “homeland” of the coronavirus - the Wuhan metropolis. And now, according to the Nikkei Asian Review, the production of popular iPhone smartphones is in jeopardy. Starbucks also found itself in a difficult situation, which, due to quarantine, had to close a large half of its four thousand coffee houses operating in China (by the way, this is the second largest market after the United States). But at the same time, the Americans for some reason do not look like such victims of the epidemic, especially Apple, whose leadership at the very beginning of the trade and economic confrontation with China advised to evacuate production facilities in the United States.\n... It seems as if President Trump saw everything in advance, like Wolf Messing or old Wang. However, both Apple and Starbucks were really out of luck. You can’t say the same about the American political establishment, which is making titanic efforts to bring to its knees the \"presumptuous China.\" And why should these efforts necessarily be of an economic nature? ..\nThe main question is - who benefits from another SARS unsettling a competitor? If we apply the well-known trick highly likely, unceremoniously used by the British ex-prime minister Theresa May to hang the so-called Skripals poisoning in Russia, the answer is obvious: the coronavirus epidemic 2019-nCoV, which hit China, is highly likely to be in the hands of the United States. And the worse for Beijing, the better for Washington. Moreover, the outlook for the epidemic is not yet encouraging. For example, some experts argue that if the spread of 2019-nCoV cannot be stopped, up to 250 million Chinese can become victims of the virus, which is almost two in number in Russia.\nBy the way, about the prospects. The Cepi Global Vaccine Coalition has reportedly invested a total of $ 12.5 million in three projects, in which researchers are ready to expeditiously develop the 2019-nCoV vaccine.\nScientists from the University of Queensland, as well as two American biotechnology companies Inovio and Moderna, participate in the work. The American National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is also involved. And it seems that microbiologists from Hong Kong have already developed a vaccine against the new coronavirus, as Professor of Hong Kong University Ewan Kwok-Jung hastened to inform the newspaper South China Morning Post. But her research, he claims, could take more than a year. German Shipulin, the deputy director of the Center for Strategic Planning of the Ministry of Health of Russia, does not promise an imminent victory over 2019-nCoV. So the hands of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV can be considered as yet untied, and there are suspicions that the United States may be involved in this epidemic. In the Russian media, this assumption has already been made.\nUS operations as part of a biological warfare against the entire planet\nAs a result of the dengue epidemic in Cuba from 1978-1981, up to 500 thousand people were affected. Fidel Castro said this was the result of an American biological attack. Washington did not confirm or refute the allegations of the Cuban leader.\nPentagon bio laboratories exist in 25 countries around the world. They are funded by the Military Threat Reduction Agency under a $ 2.1 billion military program. The joint biological cooperation program includes laboratories located in the countries of the former Soviet Union, such as Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, as well as in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nBy the location of these biological laboratories, we can confidently indicate the four countries and territories against which the American biological threats are now directed, these are Russia, Iran, China and the countries of Central and West Africa. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nThe American company CH2M Hill under the contracts for the Pentagon bio-laboratories in Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan, Southeast Asia was funded in the amount of $ 341.5 million. Of this amount, almost half ($ 161.1 million) was allocated for research in Lugar Center in Tbilisi. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nIts subcontractor, a private company, Battelle, has worked in Pentagon bio labs in Afghanistan, Armenia, Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. Battelle conducts research, development, testing and assessment of the use of both highly toxic chemicals and highly pathogenic biological agents for a wide range of US government agencies. The company has entered into federal contracts totaling $ 2 billion and ranks 23rd in the list of 100 best US state contractors. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nThe Pentagon has a very long history of using insects as carriers of disease. According to a partially declassified US Army report of 1981, American scientists conducted a series of experiments on insects. These operations were part of the US Entomological War as part of a biological weapons program. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nThe report reported two scenarios: 16 simultaneous attacks on the city by A. Aegypti mosquitoes infected with yellow fever, as well as Tularemia aerosol attack, and assessed their effectiveness in cash and loss of life. The results were very cynical. Pentagon experts managed to “kill” 625 thousand people at a cost of $ 0.29 per unit. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nOperation Big Itch: Field trials were conducted to determine the coverage and survivability of tropical rat fleas Xenopsylla cheopis for use as a disease carrier in biological warfare. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nOperation Big Buzz: 1 million A. Aegypti mosquitoes were raised. One third of them were placed in ammunition, dropped from aircraft and scattered on the ground. Mosquitoes survived in the air and actively sought human blood. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nOperations on military experiments with tropical mosquitoes and ticks in Georgia. Such species of mosquitoes and fleas (which were studied in the past as part of the US Entomological War Program) were imported into Georgia and tested at the Lugar Center. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nAnthrax is one of the biological agents in the arsenal of the US Army, not only in the past. Despite Pentagon claims that this program is only defensive, there are facts to the contrary. In 2016, at the Lugar Center, American scientists conducted a study called “Genome Sequence of the Soviet / Russian Bacillus anthracis Vaccine Strain 55-VNIIVViM” (Genome Sequence of the Soviet / Russian Anthracite Cancer Vaccine in Russia), which was funded by the US Agency’s Biological Weapons Sharing Program Threat Reduction (DTRA) in Tbilisi, and implemented by Metabiota. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nCongo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by the tick-borne virus Nairovirus (Nairovirus). The disease was first described in Crimea in 1944 and was called Crimean hemorrhagic fever. Later, it caused an epidemic in the Congo in 1969. In 2014, 34 people were infected with the CCHF, including a 4-year-old child, three of whom died. Pentagon biologists are currently studying the virus in Georgia as part of the DTRA project, Epidemiology of febrile illnesses caused by Dengue viruses and other Arboviruses in Georgia. The project included trials on patients with fever symptoms and collection of ticks as possible distributors of CCHV for laboratory analysis. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nSimilar CCHV outbreaks occurred in Afghanistan, where 3 Pentagon bio-laboratories are present. As of December 2017, 237 cases of CCHV were reported in this country, 41 of which were fatal. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nBats are also being investigated as a carrier of various diseases at the Lugar Center, which scientists say are carriers of the Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and other deadly diseases. As of June 2017, 1980 cases were recorded with 699 deaths in 19 countries around the world caused by MERS-CoV. This virus is designed and manufactured in the USA. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nAnother weapon of bioterrorism is, according to a 1981 US Army report, Tularemia developed in the USA, or Rabbit Fever. New tularemia carriers, such as ticks and rodents, are currently being developed. DTRA has launched a number of projects on Tularemia and in Georgia at the Lugar Center. Highly pathogenic agents (EDP) can be used for military purposes. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nUkraine itself does not have control over military biological laboratories on its territory. Under the 2005 Agreement between the US Department of Defense and the Department of Health of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government is prohibited from publicly disclosing confidential information about the US program. Ukraine is also required to transfer all dangerous pathogens to the US Department of Defense for biological research. Under this Agreement, the Pentagon was granted access to many state secrets of Ukraine. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nThe Pentagon has invested at least $ 65 million in gene editing research. The U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has provided seven research teams to develop tools for altering the genome of insects, rodents, and bacteria through the DARPA Safe Gene program using new CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\nThe worst biological weapon that may have already been used and possibly used in Russia is, again, perhaps used against the “enemy” of the USA - China. Until recently, ethnic biological weapons (biogenetic weapons) were theoretical weapons, the purpose of which is, first of all, to harm people of certain ethnic groups or genotypes (Russians, Chinese, etc.). Although officially the research and development of ethnic bio-weapons has never been publicly confirmed, documents show that the United States collects biological materials from certain ethnic groups - Russians and Chinese. American National Socialism in its purest form.\nUS Air Force specifically collects samples of Russian DNA and synovial tissue, which causes concern in Moscow about a hidden American program for the use of biological weapons.\nSenator Franz Klintsevich commented on the words of President Vladimir Putin about the purposeful collection of Russian biomaterial: “In the West, everything is done very scrupulously and verified to the smallest detail: if we use biological weapons, then surely ... The relevant services in the West should know that we are aware of their interest. Let those who are engaged in this work on the territory of the Russian Federation not be offended. ”\nAnd it cannot be said that such suspicions have no reason. As you know, the United States ratified the Geneva Protocol and the Biological Weapons Convention back in 1975. But biological games overseas have not stopped, and not only in the national territory. Already after the collapse of the USSR, American biological laboratories appeared, which is precisely established in Georgia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Where else - except that the State Department knows that it claims to be absolutely peaceful organizations involved in the development of medicines. But if they are so peaceful, then why, one wonders, did the Americans build them not at home, but at the other end of the world?\nAnd the participants of the “visiting” American biological project are very specialized. For example, the US Army Institute of Infectious Disease Medical Research (USAMRIID, Fort Detrick), the Military Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), which is a division of the Pentagon, the Central Asian and Caucasian Biosafety Association, which monitors the biological potential of the CIS countries, the Biological Threat Reduction Program (Nunn-Lugar program) and so on.\nComments, as they say, are unnecessary. Not so long ago, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation analyzed documents on the activities of the so-called \"health center\" that the Americans built in Georgia, and came to the conclusion: in fact, this is a \"death factory\", which killed 73 people who were used by overseas biologists as experimental rabbits. But the fact of the matter is that American bio-laboratories are scattered not only around Russia, but also around the world, where America has its own interests.\nAnd another question, where did the 2019-nCoV coronavirus originate - in a bat or in some American \"health center\"? Where is it more highly likely?"}, {"url": "https://www.albawabhnews.com/3972196", "title": "Report: US military transferred Corona to Wuhan, China", "text": "Report: US military transferred Corona to Wuhan, China\nA report published on the Canadian website concluded that the United States may be standing behind it, without the emergence of the emerging Corona virus \"Covid 19\" in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\nAnd a former Professor at the University of Shanghai, Larry Romanov, stated in a report published by the Canadian Globalresearch, that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered last summer to close a large military biological laboratory at Fort Detrick base in Maryland, in anticipation of possible leaks.\nAfter the move, the United States last August witnessed a wave of pneumonia and similar diseases, and this was attributed to the repercussions of electronic cigarettes, but this hypothesis raised the suspicions of some experts.\nAfter that, media and activists in China reported that five of the Americans who participated in the international military games competitions hosted by Wuhan last October were infected with unspecified infection.\nChinese sources suggested that this mysterious disease was in fact \"Coffed 19\", which he transferred to Wuhan, an American military, and he may have been infected by an accident that was not announced in Fort Detrick, and he was not diagnosed because of the absence of any concrete symptoms.\nkey words"}, {"url": "https://zen.yandex.ru/media/mir_chudes/bill-geits-zaiavil-chto-hochet-implantirovat-mikrochipy-v-kajdogo-cheloveka-chtoby-borotsia-s-bolezniami-5e81f0601a056b3af3dad9c9?fbclid=IwAR3mwLnMdB1dkTc0SaskVsA2wQp1eRl1lqE9w-ioDn2XwKEKyqRbfivc7U8", "title": "Bill Gates said he wants to implant microchips in every person to fight diseases", "text": "Bill Gates said he wants to implant microchips in every person to fight diseases\nRecently, Microsoft co-founder often talks about the virus-which-cannot-be-called-virus (VKNN) problem. He gave an interview to the American Internet resource TED, and before that he answered questions from users of the Reddit network platform. His controversial comments instantly became viral on the net and returned Gates to the crosshairs of the conspiracy theorists.\nDuring a session on Reddit, Gates talked about “digital certificates” that show who has recovered from or has been vaccinated against HCV. This has caused concern for many who fear that the billionaire and philanthropist will want to implant microchips in everything and everyone. But is such fear justified? Did he really say that? You will laugh, but Bill Gates did offer such a thing, but it's easier said than done. Let's see why.\nHere's what Bill Gates will do with HCNC\nGates works to reduce the risk of serious diseases worldwide, such as polio, through his organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\nIn a TED interview (see video below), Bill Gates suggested what he would do right now if he were to become president. He said he would give priority to isolation throughout the country, taking as an example the several-week period followed by China and other countries, managing to significantly reduce the number of people infected. He also called for extreme quarantine lasting from 6 to 10 weeks.\nHe disagrees with Donald Trump, who wants industrial enterprises to work for Catholic Easter (April 12), adding that he considers this a “very irresponsible” attitude.\nBill Gates on “Digital Certificates” for Vaccination\nGates gave similar answers in his topic posted on Reddit. He said that countries that do a good job of testing for the virus and remain in quarantine begin to see improvements in just a few weeks, after which, in his opinion, they should open again and return to normal life.\nHowever, his most controversial commentary was the one he made about the “digital certificates” that would record whether someone was vaccinated against VKN or not.\n“In the end, we will have digital certificates that show us who recovered, who recently tested, or when we have the vaccine, who received it,” he wrote on Reddit.\nGates may be referring to quantum dot tattoos, which are currently being developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Rice University. These tattoos are designed to store records and vaccination histories of each person. Last December, researchers from two universities said they were developing these tattoos after Gates urged them to find a solution to identify those who had not been vaccinated against various diseases.\nWhy early to worry?\nIn another related topic, some Reddit users discussed whether Gates’s idea of these digital certificates could be applied today.\nOne of them expressed concern that in the near future, in order to leave their homes, they may need a microchip built into the body with a digital record of vaccination against HCNV. Others noted that governments did not require a “digital certificate” or do something similar with other vaccines, so they are unlikely to do this with HCVN.\nIn his commentary, Gates used the “end up” turnover, and the technology he talked about was undoubtedly still at a very early stage of development. Therefore, it may be too early to start worrying that someone will make us get a tattoo or implant microchips - which is understandable given the prevailing paranoia reinforced by the media.\nHowever, this does not mean that in the future the idea of Gates will not become a reality ...\nThanks for reading!

Prominent American politicians like Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, have publicly labelled the illness as \"the Wuhan coronavirus\", in an attempt to harm China's reputation and lay the blame at Beijing's door.\nThroughout this century, China has represented the main threat to American global hegemony, and this threat to US power has gradually been growing as elites in the West are only too aware. The coronavirus, whose spectre is being exaggerated by the establishment, provides an excuse to tighten the choke-hold on China.\nThis is happening in the shadows, away from the public glare. Indeed, China is already surrounded by hundreds of US military bases in the east Asian and Pacific regions, and for well over a year Beijing has been embroiled in a bitter trade war with Washington.\nAlthough it may sound cynical, we can recognise another central factor behind the coronavirus hyperbole: that it is being exploited by the powers-that-be, in order to frighten and keep under control a world populace which has increasingly been rebelling against the assaults of neoliberal globalisation (1). A supposedly all-consuming virus is an ideal opportunity to warn the public not to gather outside in large groups, to remain isolated from each other and stay indoors. Simply put, be obedient and passive.\nA serious infectious ailment like the coronavirus does, up to a point, merit attention and concern. It would be disingenuous to suggest otherwise, particularly when the cases are notably increasing in number. The coronavirus is far more dangerous in comparison to influenza (flu) – on up to date statistics, it has a death rate which is more than 20 times greater than the flu (2). Yet these figures are evolving, and will change over the course of time, becoming more or less severe; quite often the latter case.\nIt is important to put the coronavirus into context and provide some perspective. Since late December 2019 until the present, just over 4,600 deaths have officially been attributed to the illness, out of a global human population of 7.8 billion. This makes a world death toll of a tiny fraction of 1%. Among those who have died, just over 3,000 of them were Chinese citizens, comprising more than 60% of the combined fatality count.\nAs things stand, one is far more likely to suffer death in an automobile accident, than either contracting the coronavirus or succumbing to it. Each year there are around 1.3 million deaths worldwide from traffic accidents. Almost 40,000 people were killed on the roads in America during 2019; in China, there are on average 250,000 road fatalities each year. The number of cars worldwide are responsible for 20% of global carbon emissions.\nNevertheless there are no large-scale media campaigns directed against the hazards of vehicles. Quite the opposite, car manufacturers are regularly advertised in the corporate press; who, at the same time, claim to have sincere concerns about the worsening climate crisis.\nSince the first coronavirus case was said to have occurred in eastern China over two months ago, there are at the time of writing a reported 130,000 coronavirus infections globally – with it thought to have spread to 113 nations and counting, more than half of the world's countries (3). However, this does not constitute a pandemic, as the World Health Organisation (WHO) mistakenly insists, who themselves have a somewhat dubious history in these affairs, as will be discussed below further.\nA pandemic is an outbreak of disease that is occurring over both a wide geographic area “and affecting an exceptionally high proportion of the population” (4). This stark description, which can be found in separate dictionaries, seems to have escaped the attention of the WHO. It cannot be claimed that over 100,000 infections out of a world population of almost eight billion is an exceptionally high proportion of the population. This ratio accounts once more to a small fraction of 1% of all humans. In reality this is not remotely a pandemic as of yet.\nPanic-inducing media headlines fail to mention that the majority of all coronavirus cases have still occurred in mainland China, where more than 80,000 people are reported to have been infected.\nEven in this instance, there are firm indications that the disease has successfully been contained by Beijing's authorities (5). Over three weeks ago and more, around 2,000 new coronavirus cases were recorded in China daily; but this worrying figure has dropped dramatically, with a mere 40 new cases in China occurring on Monday this week, the lowest number since tracking began. If the virus can be smothered in the world's most populace country, surely the same can be achieved elsewhere.\nStates such as Italy and Iran, with much smaller populations than China, are well advised in seeking Beijing's counsel on how to suppress this disease.\nMuch of the reporting on the coronavirus has been misleading and sensationalist. It is receiving an extent of media coverage that is not afforded to much more serious issues, like nuclear weapons and climate change – in particular the nuclear threat, which is barely focused on or even understood, despite the fact it remains the single greatest threat facing mankind.\nThe American author and military analyst Daniel Ellsberg said last year that, “It is true that climate change may totally disrupt civilisation as we know it, but how many lives would it cost? Whatever the number, some form of civilisation would probably survive. By contrast, a nuclear winter, which has a non-zero possibility of occurring, would occasion near extinction”. (6)\nEllsberg estimates that two years after a nuclear winter – which would spread globally in the weeks following a nuclear war between America and Russia or China – that about 100,000 people would be left alive out out of 7.8 billion. Hence his accurate description of “near extinction” for humanity, in the event of a nuclear war between the major powers. One will do well to find mention of this in mass media journals, however.\nAn interested scholar will also have to search hard in newspaper archives to learn anything about the near-deadly accidents, involving nuclear bombs through the decades, of which there have been many. (7)\nOne should be cautious whenever the mainstream press and first world politicians strongly push a certain agenda. This was most obvious in recent years with the ludicrous claims that Moscow decided the 2016 US presidential election in Donald Trump's favour, which the American public paid scant attention to.\nThe WHO, who have a history of unnecessarily overestimating threat of infectious diseases under suspect circumstances, have done little to dampen the hysteria regarding the coronavirus. According to the experienced German physician Wolfgang Wodarg, who is also an expert in analysing the spread of contagious diseases, the WHO is “unduly influenced by pharmaceutical companies”, as came to light with the swine flu pandemic of a decade ago.\nThe swine flu of 2009 to 2010 can be classed as a pandemic, with 700 million to 1.4 billion people infected with what was an overall mild ailment (8). This may have consisted of up to 21% of the planet's then human population.\nThe chief goal of the pharmaceutical industry, which is held dominion over by giant corporate entities, is to the requirements of short-term profit-making, like all corporations. Dr Wodarg further remarked of the swine flu in relation to pharmaceutical companies that, “the declaration of a pandemic hugely enriched the industry at the expense of taxpayers and governments”. (9)\nThe business of big pharma is accumulation of wealth for their elite base, and not in serving the public interest. An infamous virus represents a financial opening and bonanza for pharmaceutical corporations. The coronavirus is being capitalised upon with the assistance of politicians and media, whose actions are often dictated by large businesses in the neoliberal era. The media are reliant on revenue from corporate advertising, including big pharma adverts. Most media companies even have pharmaceutical representatives sitting in their boardrooms. (10)\nDuring the panic regarding the swine flu, pharmaceuticals enjoyed billions of dollars worth of profits, as governments were compelled to stockpile huge levels of drugs and vaccines, most of which were never used. The WHO guidelines were written up by scientists on the payroll of big pharma. Paul Flynn, a veteran former British Labour MP, said that “The tentacles of drug company influence are in all levels in the decision-making process” (11). This very likely remains the case pertaining to the coronavirus.\nThere is another significant reason behind the campaigns of virus scaremongering. A critical one is to try to weaken China as a state, by impacting negatively upon Beijing's ability to spread its financial clout and influence across continents. As a result of the coronavirus frenzy, the Chinese government is “losing leverage in dealings with the US and other developed countries” while “the US economy and markets could actually benefit from the coronavirus”. (12)\nChina is the only nation that can even attempt to challenge American dominance in the global arena. Over these past 20 years China's neighbour, Russia, has re-emerged as a major power under Vladimir Putin, with Moscow's presence on the international scene having grown considerably. Regardless, Russia remains an appreciably weaker country when compared to the US. In military terms alone, the Kremlin's annual arms expenditure amounts to less than 10% of the US, and this gap is widening.\nChina's military budget, the second largest in the world, is about a third that of America's. The vast economic projects of Beijing, like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), are being constructed on an unprecedented scale in modern history. This has drawn considerable international and economic influence to China, not to mention prestige.\nIt would have been unimaginable at the end of World War II – when American strength was at its peak – that the western superpower would have no involvement in a landmark industrial program such as the Belt and Road, which is headquartered in Beijing. Unfortunately for Washington this has proven the case.\nThe Americans are also excluded from Beijing's other milestone associations, like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The AIIB, centred in the Chinese capital and established in 2015, can count among its members crucial US allies like Britain, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Australia and South Korea; along with dozens of other countries, some of them NATO states. This is a major development in international affairs, as many traditional American-friendly nations defy Washington's wishes in entering organisations controlled by Beijing.\nBritain's decision to join the AIIB four years ago drew a particularly withering response from the White House. A top US official under president Barack Obama lamented that, “We are wary about a trend toward constant accommodation of China, which is not the best way to engage a rising power” (13). Instead one can presume that the best way to engage a rising power, is to surround it with military forces on an enormous scale – which is precisely what the Obama administration had accomplished by late 2016 in its encirclement of China.\nNotes\n1 Oscar Rickett, \"From Lebanon to Chile, the people are rising up against neoliberalism\", Middle East Eye, 10 November 2019, https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/middle-east-and-rest-world-are-united-struggle\n2 Live Science Staff, \"13 coronavirus myths busted by science\", Live Science, 10 March 2020, https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-myths.html\n3 Vasanthi Vara, \"Coronavirus outbreak: the countries affected\", Pharmaceutical Technology, 12 March 2020, https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/features/coronavirus-outbreak-the-countries-affected/\n4 Merriam-Webster, \"Pandemic\", https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pandemic\n5 Lily Kuo, \"How did China get to grips with its coronavirus outbreak?\", The Guardian, 9 March 2020, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/how-did-china-get-grips-with-coronavirus-outbreak\n6 Daniel Ellsberg, \"The truth-teller: From the Pentagon Papers to the Doomsday Machine\", Resilience.org, 25 April 2019, https://www.resilience.org/stories/2019-04-25/the-truth-teller-from-the-pentagon-papers-to-the-doomsday-machine/\n7 Hans M.

For six years, the vast majority of Ukrainians preferred not to notice this. The principle “If only it did not concern me” worked for the joy of Kiev officials, for whom the war became the cause and the solution to all problems. Now this is coming to an end\nIronically, it is not “Russian aggression” that is now bending Ukraine with the beech “si.” Being an atheist, I will not call the coronavirus a punishment sent from above. Nevertheless, it is difficult to argue with the fact that the epidemic somehow makes one pay for sins. For incompetent power. Last summer, I personally heard that Zelensky is Ukraine’s new hope. Now, in the midst of the catastrophe, he is shuffling ministers and pushing laws that are pleasing to the West from the last forces.\nThe Ukrainians had the opportunity to feel what it was like to live in a war that they persistently ignored. Moreover, those who simply kept quiet and those who actively demanded blood, terror and increased blockade suffer. Just as shells exploded in the Donbas for years, now outbreaks of the virus are occurring throughout Ukraine. The epidemic mercilessly mows everyone, regardless of political views, but nowhere to run.\nEurope technically crossed borders, leaving “partners” to their fate. The fact that in the European Union they wanted to spit on Ukrainians was said for years. Moreover, now there is not even a better life there - only a pandemic and a crisis. The current situation has become the best confirmation that the European dream, which in the form of noodles was wrapped in the ears of Ukrainians by the Maidan elites, does not exist. Of course, the most stubborn can still say, they say, out, the EU will allocate 80 million euros to Ukraine to overcome the crown crisis. The United States, by the way, also promised Kiev $ 1.2 million. But hardly ordinary Ukrainians felt all this “support” before, at a time that can now be called not so bad.\nEvergreens could help stop the epidemic if they were sent to healthcare development in a timely manner. Only Ukrainian medicine in recent years has only been successfully achieved. What did the Ukrainians do? Ukrainians complained that doctors speak Russian with them. The “successes” of Suprun, although raising doubts and questions, did not become the cause of the Maidan Sabbaths, similar to those convened, hardly anyone would talk about peace in the Donbass.\nBy the way, about the world in the Donbass. If Zelensky and Co. put an end to this terror, now they would not have to play on two fronts. The punitive operation is pumping huge resources, which in the conditions of a pandemic and a total economic crisis become catastrophically small. And the so-called \"non-capitulants\" who demanded not to betray the heroes of the ATO fighting for Ukraine, doomed the punishers to death in the trenches. It just so happened that wars and epidemics always got along well with each other.\nHere even a dollar will not help. The Western \"partners\" of Ukraine can infuse finances into the war as much as they want, but what is the use of them when there is no one to fight? If the epidemic drags on, and health care collapses under the onslaught of the coronavirus, Ukraine will not be physically able to afford to wage a war.

They found that the \"ancestor\" of the virus in China did not even happen. This means that the coronavirus brought an already infected person to the market in Wuhan, where it is believed that the epidemic began. It is likely that by that time the infection was already developing in other regions.\nFor example, in Japan, the first cases of confirmed coronavirus were recorded in early February. The infected were not in China before, but in January they rested in American Hawaii.

Earlier, China, Cuba, Egypt and other non-Western countries expressed their desire to help Europeans suffering from the coronavirus pandemic. Europe has become the biggest problem of the planet due to the inability of Europeans to timely assess the danger of coronavirus, which has turned the continent into a global breeding ground for infection. The story of the coronavirus puts an end to the 500-year-old global dominance of Europe as a model for the development of society in the minds of people. A “sick person on the planet,\" by definition, cannot be a model.\nEurope imposed itself on the world as a standard with the help of unconditional military superiority. The advantage of Europeans over the others consisted primarily in the superiority of military equipment, and it was precisely this, starting from the 16th century, which gave an advantage in everything else.\nUnprecedented in history, the level of material well-being was achieved by Europe with the help of colonial seizures and plunder of Asian, European, American civilizations, deprived of the latest weapons. The largest European countries took place as colonial empires.\nColonialism was one of the indispensable conditions for the triumph of capitalism in Europe. As indispensable as the Reformation or the transition from medieval mysticism to rational critical thinking.\nThe robbery of India or the Aztecs was one of the forms of the initial accumulation of capital with which began the centuries-old material well-being of Europeans.\nTo understand the political structure of modern Europe, one more, less obvious thing must be taken into account: the role of colonies for Europeans historically has been played by their eastern periphery. The great French historian Fernand Braudel, for example, directly linked the processes of European development of both Americas and the transformation of Eastern Europe into a raw materials appendage of Western.\nThe East of Europe in the early New Age had undeveloped natural resources, but did not have the technology (primarily military) to participate on an equal footing in the looting of overseas lands. Therefore, Eastern Europe took part in creating the world capitalist system as a lagging periphery from which resources are pumped. The First Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth enslaved the Ukrainian and Belarusian peasants to deliver bread to Paris.\nThis system was reproduced in the 21st century and is today called the European Union.\n“After the most powerful European countries began to lose their overseas colonial empires, they built with each other a kind of internal, continental empire based on economic and military cooperation,” writes Spanish political scientist Josep Colomer about the European Union.\nThe European \"standard\" of development of society for centuries has been achieved through the development of an external resource base. The so-called European values have grown on a fertile material basis: the doctrine of human rights, the concept of freedom and equality of all people, European-style democracy. Europe, and then the USA, to which European civilization expanded, imposed these values on the rest of the world, demanding, however, not consistent compliance, but a demonstration of a subordinate position by recognition of values imposed from outside.\nNowadays, Europeans have run out of opportunities for expanding their resource base, and the attractiveness of Europe has steadily declined for many years.\nMilitary leadership ended after World War II. Western Europeans came under the \"nuclear umbrella\" of the United States, which, in turn, did not have superiority in strategic weapons. Nuclear parity with the Soviet Union and guaranteed mutual destruction in the event of the use of atomic weapons created a situation unique in 500 years when equal force appeared in response to Western forces.\nAfter the collapse of the USSR, the West tried to rectify this situation by starting NATO eastward expansion and building a global missile defense system. However, the creation by Russia of hypersonic weapons created an unprecedented phenomenon since the Middle Ages: European nations were catching up in the field of the latest military equipment.\nWith the loss of military dominance, brilliant economic indicators began to fade. The driver of global economic growth in recent decades has been China, which has produced and sold its products to the world. The United States retained global leadership in the economy due to the unique position of the dollar in the global financial system. For the most part, Europe has consumed the wealth accumulated over the centuries of the Eurocentric world.\nIf until recently she had any advantage, then this was the so-called “soft power”: the outward attractiveness of the European way of life formed by people who wanted to imitate and reproduce.\nLet Europe “retire”, let it no longer participate in global politics, does not conquer new continents and is not even able to defend itself without the Americans, but clean streets, quality food, water that can be drunk from the tap. In a broader sense - an effective state that cares about citizens, there is almost no corruption, democracy, human rights.\nIt’s not God knows what an image of perfection is, but in many small countries this down-to-earth everyday ideal has been claimed.\nThe coronavirus story put an end to the “soft power” of Europe: in the eyes of the whole world, it has become a symbol of failure, catastrophe, stupidity, irresponsibility and slackness.\nEuropean states first dismissed the spread of the new infection, considering it “the same flu,” and then in a panic rushed to abolish the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens. The most striking example is freedom of movement.\nThe result of throwing from one extreme to another: thousands of coronavirus deaths, a collapsed economy and a luminous image of Europe that collapsed with it - a model and peak of historical development.\nThe Old World, which has suppressed its pride, humiliatingly copies the Chinese experience in fighting the pandemic and accepts humanitarian aid from Russia, Cuba, Egypt, and China. Throughout the 2010s, Europe was a territory of all kinds of crises and problems, but the coronavirus pandemic drew a line under them and converted quantity into quality.\nEurope is recognized by the world as the \"sick man\" of the planet, which must be bailed, taken care of, helped and protected.\nThe USA used to do this, and even then only to a limited extent. Now the Americans are closing themselves off from other people's troubles in their hemisphere, and Europeans have to help the rest of the world. The times of Europe’s attraction to the world are over. It is unlikely that anyone will now be able, in their right mind, to consider this undesirable aging organism the peak of historical development."}, {"url": "https://www.ahlmasrnews.com/news/International-news/983413/%D8%AA%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B9-%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B6%D8%AF-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7", "title": "Russia announces the end of the first stage of manufacturing a vaccine against SK", "text": "The head of the Russian Medical and Biological Agency, Veronika Skvortsova, announced today, Monday, that the agency's work to develop a vaccine against the emerging corona virus \"Covid 19\" has passed its first stage.\nThe Anti-Corona Virus Operations headquarters in Russia announced today, Monday, that a Corona virus detection test was performed on more than 165,000 people, and more than 72,000 people are still under medical supervision due to suspected HIV infection.\nThe representative of the Russian company \"Azure-Air\" announced that a special flight of the company took off to Morocco to evacuate Russian citizens from there in light of the spread of the \"Corona\" virus.\nSkin is good ...

Perhaps the coronavirus epidemic will be that event.\nIt is too early to draw exact conclusions, but some elements of geopolitics and ideology may have already passed the point of no return.\nThe coronavirus epidemic represents the end of globalization. The open society is ripe for infection. Anyone who wants to tear down borders prepares the territory for the total annihilation of humanity. You can smile, of course, but people in white HazMat suits will put a stop to the inappropriate laughter. Only closedness can save us. Closedness in all senses - closed borders, closed economies, closed supply of goods and products, what Fichte called a \"closed trade state.\" Soros should be lynched, and a monument should be built for Fichte. Lesson one.\nSecond: the coronavirus turns the last page of liberalism. Liberalism has made it easier to spread the virus - in all senses. The epidemic requires the demolition of all differences. Liberalism is the virus. A little more time will pass, and liberals will be equated with \"lepers\", infectious \"maniacs\" who call to dance and have fun in the midst of the plague. The Liberal is the carrier of the coronavirus, its apologist. This is especially the case if it turns out that it was created in the United States, the \"citadel of liberalism\", as a biological weapon. Lesson two: liberalism kills.\nThird: the criteria for success and prosperity of countries and societies are changing dramatically. In the battle against the epidemic, neither China's wealth nor the European social system, nor the absence of a social system in the United States (which has the world’s greatest military and financial power) will save them. Even the Iranian’s spiritual and vertical regime is not helping. The coronavirus has cut off the entire tip of civilization - oil, finance, free exchange, the market, the total dominance of the Fed... the world's leaders are helpless. Completely different criteria have come to the fore:\n- the possession of an antivirus\n- the ability to autonomously prove life for themselves and their loved ones in conditions of maximum closure.\nMeeting these criteria means reassessing all values. The vaccine is in the province of those who most likely developed the virus, and is therefore an unreliable solution. However, closure and the transition to self-sufficiency is something that everyone can do, although doing so requires multipolarity. Small farms and natural exchange will survive the total collapse of everything.\nSo, what would be the next logical steps after a triumphant march of coronavirus across the planet? At best, the appearance of several relatively closed world zones - civilizations, large spaces, or - at worst - the worlds of Mad Max and Resident Evil. The Russian series \"The Epidemic\" is becoming a reality in front of our eyes.\nThe plague gods\nI am beginning to understand why in some societies the plague gods were revered and worshipped. The coming of the plague allows for a complete renewal of societies. The epidemic has no logic and spares neither the noble nor the rich, nor the powerful. It destroys everyone indiscriminately, and brings people back to the simple fact of being. The plague gods are the fairest. Antonin Artaud wrote about this, comparing theater to the plague. The purpose of the theater, according to Artaud, is, with all possible cruelty, to return man to the fact that he is, that he is here and now, a fact which he persistently and consistently seeks to forget. The plague is an existential phenomenon. The Greeks called Apollo Smintheus \"the Mouse god\" and attributed to his arrows the power to bring plague. This is where the Iliad begins, as everyone knows.\nThat is what Apollo would do if he looked at modern mankind - bankers, bloggers, rappers, deputies, office workers, migrants, feminists... that's about it.\nBunuel has a movie called \"The Exterminating Angel\" which is more or less about this.\nHow the world ends\nOne can also take note of the elements of the epidemic that seem to suggest its being man-made, either allowing the West to use the virus against its geopolitical opponents (which explains China and Iran, but not Italy and the rest) or even the start of the targeted extermination of all these extra billions by a small circle of humanity with a vaccine which was itself produced by \"progress\" and \"open society.\" In this case, the \"plague gods\" may turn out to be quite specific representatives of the global financial elite, which has long recognized the \"limits of growth.\" But even in this case - especially if this is not the beginning of a full-fledged global genocide, but only a test of the pen - the conclusion is the same: those who pretend to be responsible for human societies are not what they seem.\nLiberalism is only a pretext for mass extermination, as colonization and the spread of the standards of modern Western civilization were. The global elites and their local puppets may be counting on surviving with a vaccine, but something suggests that this may be where the catch lies. The virus may behave inadequately, and the processes that have begun on the civilizational level, and even in individual unpredictable spontaneous events, may disrupt their carefully thought out plans.\nThe entire world economy may not collapse within a few months, but it seems to be headed in exactly that direction...\nEverything that modern people consider \"sustainable\" and \"reliable\" is pure illusion, the coronavirus is showing that clearly and vividly. In fact, once the logic of what is happening continues to develop a little further, we might see how the world ends - at least the world we know and knew. And, at the same time, the first contours of something else will begin to appear.\nMatter at risk\nIt is curious that parallel to the coronavirus, which has become, in a sense, the subject of civilization, discussions in the scientific community about “bubbles of nothing” broke out, reviving some hypotheses of the famous physicist Edward Witten, one of the main theorists of the phenomena of “superstrings.”\nAccording to the ideas of modern physicists, \"bubbles of nothing\" can arise from a \"false vacuum\", i.e. a vacuum which has not reached stability, but only seems to have reached it. In the ten-dimensional world (with 4 ordinary measurements and 6 more, present through compacification) such \"bubbles of nothing\" are quite probable. If they arise, they may suck galaxies into nothing and swallow the Universe. These whirlpools spawned of unstable vacuums leave quite an impression.\nAnd again, as in the case of coronavirus, they say “nothing bad is happening, everything is under control.” Representatives of the scientific elite reassure us that the chance of the appearance of the “bubbles of nothing” is ridiculously small.\nBut it seems to me that it is not. On the contrary, it is quite significant. The modern world is exactly such a \"bubble of nothing\" which is growing rapidly, absorbing meaning and dissolving existence: liberalism and globalization are its most vivid expressions. The coronavirus is also a bubble of nothing.\nThe nature of this virus itself is interesting (although I hate the concept of \"nature\", there is nothing more senseless). It is something between a living being - it has DNA or RNA - and a mineral (it has no cells). However, most of all, it reminds us of a neural network or even an Artificial Intelligence. It is either there, or not, living, or inanimate ... that is precisely what the “nonequilibrium vacuum” is, which creates these “bubbles of nothing.”\nWe believe that the vacuum of the universe is in equilibrium, that is, the whole cycle of possible entropy has passed… but what if this only seems to be the case?\nWhen you hear the story about the Wuhan market and imagine the struggle of bats with poisonous snakes, their fierce exchange of contagion and killer microscopic arrows of non-existence shaped like a crown, it is impossible to get rid of the image of bubbles of nothing. The same feeling is brought about by the drop in oil prices and the collapse of stock indices. Even war - with its specificity and existential awakening - does not save us from the attack of nothing, as the motivation of modern wars is so deeply entangled in material, financial and corrupt interests, having lost its original purity: the direct encounter with death. It only serves as another bubble of nothing, fulfilling its instructions to lead matter to total oblivion.\nPlague as Event\nIs it possible to expect that having coped with the coronavirus, mankind will draw the appropriate conclusions, curtail globalization, throw out liberal superstitions, halt migration and put an end to the obscene technical inventions which are immersing everyone deeper and deeper into endless labyrinths of matter? The answer is quite clearly no. Everyone will quickly go back to their old ways in the blink of an eye, before the corpses are even buried. As soon as - and if - the markets come to life and the Dow Jones wakes back up, everything will be back to normal. The naive one is he who thinks otherwise. But what does that mean? It means that even an epidemic of this scale will be turned into an unfortunate misunderstanding. No one will understand the meaning of the coming of the plague gods, no one will think about \"bubbles of nothing\" and everything will repeat over and over again until it reaches the point of no return.\nIf one pays close attention to the passage of time, it should be clear that we are currently crossing that point."}, {"url": "http://abundanthope.net/pages/Health_and_Nutrition_37/index.shtml", "title": "Health and Nutrition", "text": "Health and Nutrition\nMay 9, 2020 - DR BRUCE LIPTON - CORONAVIRUS, EPIGENETICS & IMMUNE SYSTEM - MOST DANGEROUS PART OF COVID-19 IS FEAR\nThis 45'48\" video was published by London Real on apr 10, 2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkQqxkf6heA\nRon: Please take the time to listen to this video talk Pilgrims.

That gives an IFR of 0.13% for the flu which again proves the point that Covid-19 is not like one. The seasonal flue has an R0of 1.2. SARS-CoV-2's R0is 2 to 3. The virus is at least two times more infectious than the flu, only few have immunity against it and even in well developed countries Covid-19 is 4 to 8 times more deadly than the flu. We can thereby expect that the total death rate from Covid-19 will be 10-15 times higher than the number of deaths caused by the seasonal flu during a bad year. [ Ron. .... . Arguably the coronavirus isn't more lethal than flu BUT increasing gamma radiation impacting this planet from the centre of the galaxy is apparently exacerbating the effects of caronavirus and other diseases. Also there is evidence that US and other health authorities have been counting deaths from other causes as being caused by coronavirus.

In Beijing, it is not denied that the virus could have been brought into China by the American troops. If some time ago such assumptions were little taken into account and for the most part rejected, being similar to conspiracy theories, today most politicians around the world have already begun talking about their legitimacy.\nThe US is known for its alarming activity in sponsoring biological weapon laboratories involved in the study of pathogenic biological agents, “obtaining biological material for future experiments”, as well as developing and introducing new technologies into the military sphere. Of particular interest is the geographical location of such laboratories: these are the countries of western and central Asia: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Georgia. We also note the agreement signed in 2005 between the Health Department of Ukraine and the US Department of Defense, according to which “in order to assist Ukraine in preventing the spread of technologies, pathogens and knowledge located in the Research Institute of Epidemiology and Hygiene in Lviv, as well as other facilities in Ukraine, defined by the Health Department of Ukraine, which can be used in the development of biological weapons, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the US Department of Defense provides grant aid in the amount of cash allocated to achieve this goal to the Health Department of Ukraine”.\nThe next important object is the Lugar Laboratory, also known as the Georgian Research Center in Tbilisi, which is functioning at the disposal of the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health of Georgia and is the investment project of the USA aimed at creating a strategic military facility. The laboratory is studying especially dangerous infectious diseases, but it hides the true motives of its research, which may indicate the possibility of developing biological weapons. Statements about the danger associated with the activities of this center were repeatedly voiced by Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Nikolai Patrushev, as well as numerous representatives of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The available data suggest that the main vectors of the direction of the bacteriological threat emanating from the United States are Russia and mainland China.\nTaking into account the given facts, let us try to hypothesize that the new coronavirus pneumonia is a provocation of the USA, an American military development, introduced through biological weapon laboratories located in West Asia in order to destroy the main rival of the USA – China. The goal of introducing such a means of struggle could initially be not only elimination of the constant threat of the increasing economic influence of the “Celestial Empire”, but also obtaining the greatest benefits from the trade agreement that was supposed to be concluded with China: after all, it was much easier to agree with an economy weakened by coronavirus that had struck its main driving force, on conditions, not entirely beneficial for it. In this case, it was already a question of an ethnic war conducted with the use of new bacteriological weapons. Trump’s traditional attacks on China add fuel to the fire, an attempt to accuse it of launching a global pandemic is Trump’s typical game in the style of “the best defense is an attack”.\nHowever, now that the political intrigue is gaining new momentum and the US itself is falling into the hole it made for its rival, what does the world superpower have to do next?\nOn March 29, a source in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation said that Russia was concerned about the US military and biological activities in nearby countries, being implemented in the laboratory workouts financed by the Pentagon, and insists on clarifying the purpose of these laboratories.\n“As for the “American trace” in the emergence of COVID-19, we don’t have such information for today”, – a source in the Foreign Ministry said. “However, for a long time we have been watching with concern the US military and biological activities carried out in close proximity to our borders. In our neighboring countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia, and the latter border with China, there are biological laboratories created with the money of Washington and with the participation of business travelling specialists from there”, – he added.\nThe Italian political expert Tiberio Graziani, President of the Vision & Global Trends International Institute for Global Analysis, in an interview with News Front correspondents, commented on the situation as follows:\n“Currently, with reference to the lab creation of the coronavirus, as a bacterioligic weapon, there are no certain elements to affirm it. The fact that these theories or assumptions run on various media and social networks is a demonstration of the frustration of those who write or disseminate them. However, it should be emphasized that so-called conspiracy hypotheses of this kind actually create a smoke screen that prevents a serious, peaceful and articulated debate on global epidemics.\n“In my opinion, the question of such health crises cannot be reduced to an ideological confrontation. However, this must not be an alibi for not investigating military laboratories that develop bacterioligic weapons”, – Mr. Grziani said.\nThe conclusion suggests itself: of course, we should not prematurely put conspiracy theological ideas into the mass consciousness of the civilian population. Nevertheless, the question of the open, legal functioning of worrying laboratories is one of the leading issues on the political agenda of government agencies of all countries of the world community. Joint efforts should be made to study the activities of centers for the research of biological material, ideologically and financially supported by the United States of America. One of the priority tasks is to give Lugar’s Tbilisi laboratory an international status, which will allow independent experts from Russia, European and Western countries to fully participate in its activities and be aware of all the nuances of the experiments. This will increase the chances of preserving the right to a safe existence of citizens in the nearby territories.\nTrump recalled Germany’s Nazi past and called for friendship with Russia"}, {"url": "https://al-ahd.net/2020/03/22/%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B2-%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%8A-%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85-5-%D8%B3%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA/", "title": "Corona virus puzzle that slept 5 years!", "text": "Corona Virus\nThe controversy over the origin of the new coronavirus (Corona) has not subsided since it broke out in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, killing thousands and wounding about a quarter of a million people around the world.\nThis controversy escalated, especially between the United States and China, to the highest levels, as US President Donald Trump described it as a Chinese virus, while Beijing suspected that he was an American.\nAlthough scientists and specialists are now busy combating this deadly epidemic, regardless of its source, and some confirm that there are no indications of its creation and that it is a \"natural\" virus known \"lineage\", it was exposed to a mutation that turned it into a \"killer\" that has the ability to penetrate human cells, except A report published by the American journal, Nature, known for its sobriety, still threw more oil on \"conspiracy theory\" oil.\nThis report was published on November 12, 2015, and reported that US scientists have created in the laboratory a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats in connection with a virus that causes SARS, that is, acute respiratory syndrome.\nThe magazine showed about 5 years ago that scientists had examined a virus called \"SHC014\", which was found in horseshoe bats in China.\nThese scientists combined the surface protein of \"SHC014\" with the SARS virus, and came out with a new virus that provided the surface protein with a structure that helps it penetrate into the cells of the human respiratory system. It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\nIn this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans.\nResearchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than previously thought.\"\nOn the other hand, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify \"potential risks\".\nSimon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: \"If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.\"\nIn October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on \"job promotion\", especially those that cause serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans.\nSource: NATURE"}, {"url": "https://whatsnewsye.com/news6787.html", "title": "Corona is not considered deadly to all humans", "text": "Corona is not considered deadly to all humans\nMany scientific studies have been done after talking a lot about the emerging corona virus that started in China and killed a large number of people and infected others in separate regions around the world, these studies were by spreading correct concepts of this virus that reduce fear in humans.\nIn a report published by the American \"Forbes\" magazine, it confirmed that there are some incorrect concepts about the virus, that it is not considered the most prevalent among other pathogens, for example, measles is faster than it is.\nThe death rate from this virus is 2%, which is a very small percentage for the rest of the epidemics such as Ebola, whose death rate reached 50%, as well as the natural flu that kills tens of thousands of people annually in America.\nCorona is not considered a serious matter for the whole world, as it threatens China because it is specifically manufactured to reproduce within the physical environment that carries the chromosomes of the yellow race or the East Asian race, so to speak.\nIt is worth noting that the means of alternative medicine do not cure the corona, and the most important thing is to prevent this virus in the best way that is to wash your hands well and frequently, in addition to not friction with any sick person, because there is no treatment or vaccine at the present time."}, {"url": "https://www.fondsk.ru/news/2020/03/24/litva-net-ni-vrachej-ni-zapasa-produktov-50437.html", "title": "Lithuania: No Physicians, No Food Stock - Strategic Culture Fund", "text": "The coronavirus epidemic in Lithuania has clearly demonstrated the results of democratic reforms on the way to a “bright European future”.\nAt the very beginning of the ХХl century, the optimization of medicine and health care was carried out in Lithuania, as a result of which the number of medical institutions was sharply reduced - all small ones were closed and only large ones were left. Today in the country there are only five medical centers in the largest cities - in Kaunas, Klaipeda, Siauliai, Panevezys and Vilnius. In the districts, something like paramedic points remained for emergency assistance.\nIf there are few hospitals, then there are few doctors - and today this problem is one of the main ones, we have to involve senior students of medical universities in the fight against the epidemic, but all the same, specialists are sorely lacking.\nThe Minister of Defense of Lithuania Raimundas Karoblis has already promised that the military will be sent to help the doctors, but would anyone really want him to be treated not by a doctor, but, for example, by an artilleryman?\nThe second problem associated with the consequences of “democratic reforms” is that the country does not have strategic food supplies. Although just a few days ago, on March 19, the Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernialis assured the country's population that there were enough products in the “bins of the motherland” and there was no cause for concern. But everything was spoiled by the ex-Minister of Agriculture Kazis Starkevičius, who told reporters that there is cause for concern and that it lies in the fact that Lithuania does not have a strategic supply of food.\n“In 2010, in case of emergency, 200 thousand cans of canned pork, 3.5 thousand tons of wheat flour, 1.6 thousand tons of rice, 1.3 thousand tons of semolina, 700 tons of sugar were bought for state reserve warehouses. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, today the food reserve consists only of grain and sugar. The remaining reserves are eaten, \"\n- said Kazis Starkevičius.\nAccording to him, in 2012 amendments to the law on the state reserve were adopted, according to which \"reserves were accumulated on the basis of preliminary agreements.\" This meant that companies, receiving money in advance, pledged in an extreme situation to supply everything necessary for the needs of the population. However, today no one really knows which companies are suppliers, moreover, in the context of the global crisis, whether these suppliers can provide the country with everything necessary is unknown.\nStarkevičius recalled that in January of this year alone, more than 9 thousand tons of chicken meat was produced in Lithuania, 40% of which was exported, and the rest was eaten. And nothing fell into the state reserve.\nThe ex-head of the Ministry of Agriculture insists that it is urgent to provide assistance to farmers, who today not only have nothing to buy fertilizers and spare parts for machinery, but it’s generally impossible to buy planting stock due to quarantine restrictions. This year's harvest is already at stake, Starkevičius warned.\nAgainst this background, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, speaking on Monday, March 23, said that there is a possibility of imposing martial law in the country. The command of the army will present its plan for the introduction of martial law on Tuesday, March 24.\nSob. correspondent FSK"}, {"url": "http://www.akherkhabaronline.com/ar/%D9%85%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA/117308/%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B3-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%A3%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%84%D8%B2%D8%B1%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B1%D8%A4%D9%88%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B3.html", "title": "A new conspiracy theory / Bill Gates behind the emergence and spread of the \"Corona\" virus to plant electronic chips in people's heads", "text": "Mix\nA new conspiracy theory / Bill Gates behind the emergence and spread of the \"Corona\" virus to grow electronic chips in people's heads\nMore\nCorona-related names given to newborns\nAgencies - Parents have begun naming their newborn babies, after the seemingly uncomfortable Corona virus, of the prospect of their children being forever linked to a deadly pandemic.

In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.\nIs the virus a biological weapon?\nA former member of the United Nations Commission on Biological Weapons, Igor Nikulin, believes that the emergence of this virus could be the result of the use of an American biological weapon. He mentioned the scandal in 2010, when one of the 400 American military biological laboratories deployed around the world was closed in Indonesia because it was conducting secret experiments with the bird flu virus. When the virus emerged from the laboratory and a serious pandemic began, the United States refused to provide information about its work to the Indonesian Ministry of Health.\nHealth officials around the world are racing to control the virus, which first appeared last month, similar to the SARS virus, and the World Health Organization is expected to announce later today whether the spread of the new disease warrants a declaration of an emergency, which relates to complex cross-border epidemics.\nThe vaccine against the virus\nIn less than a week, virologists from the Novosibirsk State Scientific Center \"Viktor\" developed a diagnostic test system for Corona virus, which would allow detection of the virus at an early stage of the disease.\nBut it is too early to talk about the development of a vaccine. State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin has asked the State Duma Health Protection Committee to prepare anti-virus measures in the country.\nAmong the measures taken, all travelers arriving from Southeast Asia are examined by thermal imaging at the airports. Hospitals in the Amur region are on high alert. Likewise, preventive measures are being taken across the country - especially in large transport centers. In particular, quarantine control at checkpoints at state borders has been strengthened, and the epidemiological situation is monitored daily.\nRussian consumer protection agency, Ross Potter Nadzor, said that the specialists of the \"Victor\" Center (within the organization) devised tools for the laboratory diagnosis of the new disease.\nScientists from Novosibirsk developed two independent diagnostic groups, based on the method used in molecular biology and the chain polymerase reaction. Using one of these methods, the 2019-nCoV virus can be detected at an early stage, and the second is used to diagnose another serious disease that humanity has encountered before is SARS. The polymerase chain reaction method is very sensitive: it can even detect individual copies of viruses in only 2-4 hours. For this, a small swab of the nasopharynx is sufficient. Thus, rapid diagnosis can be made immediately in the laboratories of the Russian Epidemiology Centers of the Russian Consumer Protection Agency located throughout the country.\nIt is reported that \"Victor\" one of the largest scientific centers in virology and biotechnology in Russia and the world. Here, one of the first test systems was developed to diagnose HIV and hepatitis B, immunostimulating drug \"Ridustine\" and many other unique medicines.\n\"It is impossible to develop a vaccine within a week, and the evaluation of efficacy also needs time. This is the seventh version of the Corona virus known to humanity since 1965,\" Gennady Onishchenko told the Tsargrad website. Our country is using a vaccine against it yet, and we must understand that different viral diseases require total or regional vaccination only in the event of a disease.

Common sense is gone and mass hysteria is the new normal. A virus, COVID-19, is used to control the lives of people, and it's also a tool of suppression against the population.\nI am not going to claim whether there is a virus or not, whether it’s as dangerous as they say, or where it originated, be it in a laboratory or bio-weapon or a real virus. I only see that it has brought fear and, already in some EU countries, terror among the population. Easter 2020; where EU governments forbid us to see our beloved ones, where EU governments forbid us to travel, where most of us lose their income because they forbid us to work and take our bread without compensation. Where they tell us to wait until there is a vaccination from Bill Gates and his sponsors, the criminal gang of the Rockefellers (sponsors of the John Hopkins University). They are controlling our lives, our children's lives. If there is a virus, we can protect the elderly and sick but not destroy whole nations and people. I laughed about conspiracy thinkers in the past, but a lot of it is now reality and “new normal” as they call it. It’s 1984, and we didn’t do a thing to stop it, maybe it was too overwhelming. EU Statement The EU is mistreating, according to the law, the elderly and sick. You can't forbid people from seeing their old mothers and fathers, or even holding a funeral for them, that is really criminal. Ursula Von der Leyen, head of the EU, also expects that: \"elderly people in care homes cannot be visited as long as there is no vaccine. I know that's difficult, but it's about human lives”, she said. “We have to be disciplined and be very patient\". \"We will have to live with the virus for months, probably until next year.\" So many elderly and sick will die without saying goodbye to their beloved ones for almost a year? How cruel. Also, she dictates that we are not allowed to book a trip or holiday, meaning we have to wait for vaccinations and forcibly be vaccinated, also a violation of human rights and freedom. This is especially so when scientists say that younger people are not dying, and weren’t we told ten or twenty years ago that the best way to catch a cold so that we get a better immune system? All of that is thrown out, and according to the EU (German- and French-dominated), our lives will never be the same after COVID-19, how frightening! China is partly back to normal, so why drive people to suicide or hunt them like criminals? Because it’s not about the virus anymore, but about power. The New Normal Ready for the one and a half meter society? \"We will have to look for the new normal in the one and a half meter society ,\" Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, the head of the EU, and Bundespresident Steinmeier of Germany declared, independent from each other, but on the same time on their national TV stations. “We are still in the middle of the corona crisis, although the number of new deaths and registered infections is leveling off”. “We can get a normal summer out of our minds , because measures will remain in force even after April 28\" , they declared as well, meaning lockdown until at least September , or if and when there is a vaccination. Is this democracy? These are the signs of a totalitarian EU body which wants to control the lives of people from birth to death, where they control even our deaths , without proper funerals and loved ones. These are statements not to be made by so-called “democratic” countries, their rhetoric is an Orwellian message to us, the “free” citizens of Europe. Eurobonds\nA solidarity fund to ensure that the poorest countries in the EU, like Italy, Spain and Greece -- the countries who, by the way, have been hit the hardest by the COVID-19 crisis and have their countries full of migrants and migrant workers toiling for the rich German supermarkets -- pay low interest on their bonds has been taken off the table. Ironically, the richest countries, the Netherlands and Germany, voted against it, while France is silent on this matter. How dare they speak about solidarity, it’s people who are dying, not the Italian government, the people in the streets of Naples, Sicily, and small towns in southern Italy are not dying from COVID-19 but from hunger and suicide. They ask us, the citizens of the EU, to show solidarity, but we can’t because the EU is not for us since it only show ssolidarity with money for themselves and not for us. We are heading towards the suppression and loss of our freedom, a virus was needed and we gave up all our human rights, but this whole process started already in 2015 during the illegal wars in the Middle East."}, {"url": "https://cz.sputniknews.com/nazory/2020033111739567-cernobyl-katastrofa-koronavir-italie-energetika-jadro-cesky-vedec-vladimir-wagner-nazor/", "title": "What is the difference between the Chernobyl disaster and coronavirus in Italy? The Czech scientist criticized European blindness", "text": "Last week, Mr Wagner's article caught our attention, in which the scientist stated, among other things, that despite a two-month time reserve, European states did not immediately apply China's successful experience in the fight against coronavirus. According to him, this happened mainly due to the feeling of superiority and political commitment. In addition, Mr Wagner pointed out that the current coronavirus pandemic had highlighted the need to ensure energy self-sufficiency. We have decided to ask Mr. Wagner a few additional questions about energy and we bring you the first part of the interview.\nThe period of prosperity and peace gave a deceptive sense of security\nSputnik: How do you think the Czech Republic manages to manage the virus? In your article for the Invisible Dog portal, you wrote the following: “Europe had at least two months to prepare for and cope with the best possible epidemic. At the same time, it could draw on the experience gained in China and the other countries mentioned. Unfortunately, she did not take this opportunity. And in many cases, it was ideological and political blindness. ”Why do you think Europe was“ blind ”and did not detect the threat in time?\nVladimír Wagner: In my opinion, not only politicians, but especially the whole society were not prepared for the coming pandemic. Europe has experienced a very long period of prosperity and peace. And the whole of society has gained the feeling that it is entitled to prosperity and security and does not even have to strive for them. Many people have forgotten that freedom means above all responsibility and respect for others. She got the idea that they could afford to do anything, and the state then has a duty to cut them out of the problems they caused. This, too, has been the cause of the attenuating attitude of many politicians and the public in the early stages of the epidemic, which are most important for managing it.\nThese Asian countries have different political systems. However, the basic procedures they used to combat the epidemic were essentially the same or similar. Of course, they also depended on how strong a wave of the epidemic broke out in them. South Korea and Japan, which put in place the necessary measures in time, did not have to face an epidemic like the one in Wuhan.\nEurope's failure was also largely due to the fact that, due to a certain sense of ideological superiority, it failed to take rational practices from Asia and see the risks involved. Taking experience and help from these countries does not really mean taking over their political system. However, a large part of politicians and the public have not realized this and do not realize it yet. A pandemic cannot be faced without broad global cooperation and effective mutual assistance and experience.\nWhat is the difference between the mass gathering of feminist and political organizations in Madrid and other Spanish cities at a time when it was clear that the epidemic was already intense in Italy and in Spain, from the May Day parade in Kiev in the shadow of the Chernobyl disaster? How is the alleviation and concealment of the course and risk of the epidemic different not only by officials in Italian ski resorts and in Ischgl, Austria, differentiated from the denial and concealment of the first cases of the disease in Wuhan, China? Demonstrations at MDŽ are thus the main cause of the critical situation in Madrid, and ski resorts in Italy and Austria have spread the epidemic throughout Europe.\nAnother reason was the choice between two approaches to the epidemic. European countries flirted between the two possible approaches. In the first, radical measures are aimed at reversing the development of the epidemic and mainly preventing overloading of the health system. If the wave of the epidemic stops, a system of massive testing and clever quarantine will be set up, which will make it possible to gradually loosen measures and restore economic development. This should then make it possible to mitigate the development of the epidemic or even to eliminate it completely without unduly restricting the economy. The mentioned Asian countries went in this way, as well as the Czech Republic and other V4 countries or Israel.\nPersonally, I am very glad that the Czech Republic has chosen the first approach from the beginning. She had the advantage that her public saw the situation in Italy, which influenced the adoption of timely measures and mitigated the typical Czech stitching to a reasonable degree. Of course, it is not possible at present to say whether the wave of the epidemic will be stopped and the smart quarantine system will be launched. There were a large number of skiers from Italy and Austria. And it is no longer possible to predict how a country that is a very open economy will cope with the economic effects of a pandemic. However, if this is to succeed, I consider it important to get as involved as possible in global cooperation and assistance. Only in this way is it possible to overcome a pandemic with the least possible consequences.\nCommon features between health supplements and electricity production\nIn the same article, you mention that the current crisis has shown that sufficient emphasis needs to be placed on strategic security, both in the medical device sector and in the energy sector. You add the following words: 'In the situation we are seeing after 2022, when there will be a shortage of stable weather-independent sources throughout Europe, and therefore electricity at a time when it is not blowing and unlit, no one can be expected to take care of us. Without electricity, we will collapse even faster than in the case of this epidemic. ”Why do you think that and how do you think the Czech Republic could ensure energy self-sufficiency?\nElectricity is really the blood of modern civilization. We can see this clearly even now, when much of the work and communication has moved to the Internet. If there was no electricity, the collapse would be much faster than in the current pandemic. Its disadvantage is that the possibilities of its storage are minimal. Electricity production and consumption must therefore be balanced.\nSo far, the Czech Republic has sufficient resource output and overall production. It is even an exporter. Even in the future, it should switch off existing resources only if it has built enough compensation to meet Czech needs. At the same time, it should start building new nuclear units as soon as possible and support the construction of renewable sources in a decentralized form, which would replace decommissioned sources.\nWhy the core is a strategic necessity for the Czech Republic. It meets the safety requirements for it\nAlthough nuclear energy is considered to be one of the cleanest and most technologically friendly technologies, its safety is a matter of serious concern in the EU. That is why the EU insists that nuclear be phased out of energy sources. Austria has long protested against the operation and expansion of Temelín reactors near the border. However, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš considers the core to be strategically important for the Czech energy mix. How safe is the nuclear system of the Czech Republic? Is it possible to find a compromise with Austria and how?\nEnergy is the responsibility of every country in the European Union, and its neighbors cannot impose it on each other. For the Czech Republic, which does not have the Alps and great potential in hydroelectric power plants, nuclear energy is a strategic necessity. Austria should respect that. The Czech Republic will, of course, comply with all security and international obligations in this area.\nThe next part of the interview with Vladimír Wagner will be published by the Sputnik editorial office in the coming days.\nThe views expressed in this article may not always be in line with Sputnik's position."}, {"url": "https://southfront.org/coronavirus-outbreak-in-europe-criminal-negligence-or-preplanned-action/", "title": "Coronavirus Outbreak In Europe: Criminal Negligence Or Preplanned Action", "text": "Donate\nEurop is in panic. It’s targeted not only by a new wave of illegal migrants sent by Turkey and the collapse of energy markets, but also by a coronavirus threat. Over the past days, Italy became the key center of the coronavirus outbreak sparking declarations about a total lockdown.\nThe virus, known as Covid-19, has now infected close to 115,000 people worldwide and resulted in more than 4,000 deaths. The majority of these cases are in mainland China, where the outbreak first emerged. As of March 10, a total of 80,761 cases and 3,136 deaths were registered. However, Beijing seems to be gaing an upper hand and the rate of infection has been slowing significantly in the country, and the situation stabilizing. Over 60,000 people recovered and during the past 24 hours, there were only 26 new coronavirus cases registered in mainland China. The nubmer of coronavirus cases per 1 million of population stands at approximately 56.1.\nSouth Korea, which was another epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, is also dealing with the situation successfully. The toal number of cases is 7,513. The number of death is 54. During the past 24 hours there were 35 new cases registered only. The total number of cases per 1 million of people is 146.5.\nThe situation is fully different in Europe. During the past few days only, Italy (mostly), France and Spain turned to be the center of chaos and virus hysteria. The speed and scale of the outbreak is surprising. According to live updates, there were a total of 9,172 cases registered in Italy with 463 deaths already. 1,797 new cases and 97 new deaths were registered on March 9 only. The number of total cases per 1 million of population is 151.7. This is higher than in China and South Korea despite the fact that the density of population in Italy is much lower.\nThe crisis in France and Span is not so acute, but it also surprising.\nEurope has almost 1.5 months to prepare for the spreading coronavirus problem. However, no effective measures were apparently employed. The disregard to epidemiological norms and measures needed to combat the oubreak is among the key issues named by local sources.\nUntil recently, all limitations and measures employed by Italian authorities were merely a formality. On March 9, the northern region of Lombardy and 14 other provinces were placed under lockdown. Additional measures included blanket travel restrictions, a ban on all public events, the closures of schools and public spaces such as movie theaters, and the suspension of religious services including funerals or weddings. However, Italy is already the center of the outbreak and all these measures appear to be at least late.\nFor example, India, which is located relatively near such centers of the outbreak as South Korea, China and Iran, did not fall into such a crisis. The difference is in the measures employed.\nThere is little doubt that the coronavirus threat is overestimated by mainstream media and governemnts. Covid-19 is in fact an ordinary viral disease with a slightly higher mortality from complications for people of old age or peopel with weakened immunity. Another open secret is that the current hysteria over the outbreak is being successfully used by some players to achieve their own economic and geopolitical goals. Looking at the current situation in Europe, one could suppose that some forces have seized an opportunity and are now fueling the coronavirus crisis intentionally.\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n- Russia Appears Unprepared For Market Chaos (Again)\nDonate"}, {"url": "http://www.elgornal.net/news/news.aspx?id=13951105", "title": "Corona ...

One of the grants is the Soros grant. It has long been proven that he is participating in the “extinction of humanity” mission. But the fact that the Belarusian opposition is involved in this, for sure, few people know. At first they did this unconsciously: they took grants from Soros for all kinds of harmless “social” programs, and when they were told what exactly they were directed to, this did not stop them. The opposition continued to take money to crush their own people with their “social programs”.\nWhy is the Belarusian opposition participating in the “extinction of humanity” program (exclusively in its region)?\nFirstly, because the opposition hates its people, which does not support them at all. Let us recall the last example from the primaries, when opposition candidates traveled to the cities of Belarus and presented themselves. As long as the fellows, anarchists, nationalists and revolutionaries came to their gatherings, everything was fine. And when the PEOPLE came to two of the meetings, Pavel Sevyarynets abruptly dropped out of the race. Following him, the deputy chairman of the Belarusian Popular Front party Aleksey Yanukevich did the same. Oppositionists do not need the people to vote for them; oppositionists need to gather a dozen “scumbags” in every corner of Belarus in order to organize a bloody revolution where the genocide of the people will come first. What do you think the opposition will do when they come to power? Correctly. They will get their “shooting lists” and will reduce the country's population, primarily recouping their offenders - the police, officials, judges, teachers, etc.\nSecondly, because the opposition is well paid for it. We recall all the attempts of the revolution of 2006 and 2010. How many opposition people made fortunes on ordinary people - they bought houses abroad, took lovers to resorts, lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in Las Vegas, bought prostitutes and had fun with them. This is all proven material! The Soros program, aimed at the extermination of humanity, has its own curators in every corner of the world, and these curators, believe me, live very well for the millions received. They are not afraid of either devaluation, inflation, or ... attention! no revolution! Now Mr. Soros launched a biological weapon around the world - “test tube with coronavirus”. Do you think our “zmagars” do not have this test tube? Of course, there is ... It is not in vain that in February the US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo flew in with his American “Sorovskys” colleagues. It was not for nothing that they met with “civil society”, who had long been fed on US grants “to exterminate humanity”. Let's not hide their names - human rights activist Ales Bialiatski, TBM chairman Elena Anisim, revolutionaries Nikolai Statkevich and Pavel Severinets, bloggers Sergey Tikhanovsky and Sergey Petrukhin. Each of them or his activists has a “test tube with coronavirus” - a special gift from Mr. Soros. Now their cash account is replenished not due to popularity and slogans, their cash account depends on the number of victims of the Belarusian people. And the bill goes to tens of millions ... Soros counted everything!\nYou should not just run away to buy toilet paper, buckwheat, flour, sugar ... You should not give in to panic. Our citizens simply need to decide what to do with the enemies and traitors of the people. How long will the people tolerate them and allow themselves to be mocked? But we seem to have forgotten about the third point: why the Belarusian opposition is participating in the Soros program “for the extinction of humanity”. The answer is simple - she loves power! And for the sake of gaining power, they will do everything - to exterminate their own people (genocide), to a bloody revolution, to the betrayal of the motherland and much more.\nThe Belarusian opposition is ready to go to the apocalypse of mankind, if, as the Belarusian Popular Front party’s deputy chairman Aleksey Yanukevich recently said, “bel-chyrvona-bely” banners hung on Karl Marx Street, where the red color on the flag symbolizes rivers of blood. For “bel-chyrvona-bely” the sons will kill anyone and their own people as well. That’s the whole “zmagarskaya” truth about our Belarusian opposition.\nAndrey Korshunov"}, {"url": "https://ru.armeniasputnik.am/analytics/20200404/22627715/Pandemiya-vyyavila-prioritety-ili-Kak-flagi-Evrosoyuza-perekochevyvayut-v-italyanskie-chulany.html", "title": "The pandemic has identified priorities, or How EU flags migrate to Italian closets", "text": "Arman Vaneskeghyan, political observer for Sputnik Armenia\nThe pandemic continues, the end and edge of the fight against infection is not yet visible.\nHowever, the European Union, the hardest hit by the coronavirus, is already starting a desperate struggle for survival.\nJudging by the disagreements between the EU members that the bureaucratic apparatus in Brussels is facing, radical legal and ideological changes cannot be avoided. This is if Italy, insulted in its best feelings, does not leave.\nIn general, about Italy a special conversation\nThe fifteen thousand human lives that this country originally laid on the altar of the fight against COVID-19 is a factor that European officials must reckon with. Yes, and to repent for the fact that in the midst of a virus attack left their ally face to face with an invisible, and from this an even more terrible enemy, it would not hurt.\nBut we have what we have. Namely: many of the European capitals are not at all eager to truly, fully help the decimated Italian economy. Moreover, even the ordinary issue of common Eurobonds, given that they will repay the loan together, has become a pan-European stumbling block.\nThe game with China and Iran is on the verge of a foul: Trump and Pompeo shut up in the \"good and evil cops\" >>\nThe initiators of the creation of such a financial instrument were some European countries that were hit hardest by the pandemic. This is Italy (15 thousand victims), Spain (12 thousand), France (already almost 7 thousand). It would seem, what is there to think that a financial instrument (corresponding, by the way, to the ideology of the EU’s existence) has really been developed, which makes it possible to jointly alleviate the effects of the economic crisis, which is already starting as a result of the pandemic.\nSo no - Germany, Holland, Austria categorically opposed such tools. Obviously - they do not want to take responsibility for the \"other people's debts\". Here, even the apologies of the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will not help - EU flags from the offices of Italian deputies are already migrating into closets.\nWill the EU save half a trillion dollars? Unfortunately, bargaining is appropriate here ...\nWell, when the strict financial standards on which the ideas of the very existence of the European Union are based, bankrupted Greece - the Italians chose to remain silent.\nBut only now, a month after the spread of the infection, the same Germany agreed to soften the export standards of medical equipment (including masks, gloves, and so on) from its territory. But then, a month ago, in Italy, the first acts of the COVID-19 tragedy unfolded. Here is such European solidarity.\nEurope's decline: why in a pandemic era the values of pseudo-democracy were hidden in a safe >>\nIf you dig deeper, then in the current situation you can easily see the tough confrontation for EU leadership between Berlin and Paris. It always existed, exacerbated after the scandalous brexitis, when the third contender for European leadership - London - self-destructed from the arena. However, now that it is already obvious that the consequences of the current pandemic will be serious perturbations of the basic principles of the EU’s very existence, the aggravation of this struggle was fairly easy to predict.\nBerlin seeks outside support around the world. The list of leaders, together with German President Steinmeier, who signed the global alliance against coronavirus, is impressive: Jordan, Ethiopia, Singapore, Ecuador ... Things are really bad in the EU, since the Germans are looking for support elsewhere.\nIn fact, if anything could shake the basis, the basis of the foundations of the existence of such a powerful structure as the European Union, these are only financial differences. Which, in fact, happened. Now the EU leadership is making desperate attempts to save - desperate steps are being taken to launch a financial package to help the economy as much as half a trillion euros.\nEverything is in place there - the European stabilization mechanism in the amount of up to 240 billion euros, and the European Investment Bank with a pan-European guarantee fund (200 billion euros). There is the European Commission, which has provided a reserve of 100 billion euros for employment protection schemes.\nEU image and authority will be at least spoiled\nAll of these billions to save business and the European economy, of course, will do something. However, it should be understood that the pandemic does not allow time for the buildup of the European bureaucracy, and the finance ministers of the eurozone countries (Eurogroup) are going to start agreeing on this same package of half a trillion euros only on April 7th. As an example, one could cite the United States, whose president, it seems, quickly “snapped” senators and congressmen totaling 2.2 trillion ...\nHowever, since then the number of unemployed in the United States has reached a disastrous figure of ten million people. Judging by the sources from the place, the population did not receive even those same lump-sum benefits (like a thousand with something \"on the nose\" and another 500 for each child). Bureaucracy - it is like that.\nMake the face “brick” or give Iran a chance: coronavirus poses a dilemma for the US >>\nAnd they die from the coronavirus in Europe every day. The top four statistics - Italy, Spain, France, Britain. And even under these conditions, Brussels, if it is \"itchy,\" is by no means as quick as it is necessary in order to save human lives. It turns out that in the ideology of the European Union itself, the financial component is more important than human lives?\nIn fact, now the Brussels European bureaucracy is not at all busy with allocating all available financial reserves to fight COVID-19, to save the lives of Europeans. Brussels is more likely concerned about how much the economy and business of the European Union will “bend” as a result of the pandemic.\nWhat, then, should think of the reaction of this bureaucracy in this context, when the world community and individual countries turn to them with requests and calls for lifting unilateral blockades and sanctions, say, suffocating from COVID-19 of Iran or Venezuela? The only thing they have enough for is in a pandemic, together with the Americans, to block at the UN the initiative to lift all sanctions without exception that Russia has come up with.\nTrump is defending, not attacking: what are the sharp \"body movements\" of the United States in the era of the pandemic >>\nOr to make a statement that when implementing sanctions, the EU makes an exception for all that countries need to deal with the pandemic. In such circumstances, Europeans should come to terms with the fact that after a pandemic, the prestige and authority of the European Union in the eyes of the entire world community will be at least spoiled ..."}, {"url": "https://sputnik-georgia.com/russia/20200330/248114317/sluckim-evroparlamentis-mxridan-ruseTis-misamarTiT-gaJRerebul-braldebebze-isaubra.html", "title": "Slutsky spoke about allegations made by the European Parliament against Russia", "text": "Tbilisi, March 30 - Sputnik.

The world will never be the same again. However, it is premature to talk about what kind of world it will end up being. The epidemic has not passed: we have not even reached the peak. The main unknowns remain the following:\n- how many losses will humanity suffer in the end - how many deaths?\n- who will be able to stop the spread of the virus and how?\n- what will be the real consequences for those who fell ill and for those who survived?\nNo one can yet answer these questions, even roughly, and therefore we cannot even remotely imagine what the real damage will be. In the worst case, the pandemic will lead to a serious drop in the world population. At best, panic will prove premature and unfounded.\nBut even after the first months of the pandemic, some global geopolitical changes are already quite evident and largely irreversible. No matter how the events that follow will develop, something in the world order has changed once and for all.\nUnipolarity in decay\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic represents a decisive moment in the destruction of the unipolar world and the collapse of globalization. The crisis of unipolarity and the breakdown of globalization have been evident since the beginning of the 2000s - the catastrophe of September 11, the strong growth of the Chinese economy, the return to Putin's Russia's global politics as an increasingly sovereign entity , the strong mobilization of the Islamic factor, the growing migration crisis and the rise of populism in Europe and even in the United States, which led to the election of Trump and many other parallel phenomena, made it clear that the world formed in the nineties around the predominance of the West, the United States and global capitalism has entered a phase of crisis. The multipolar world order begins to form with new central actors, civilizations, as anticipated by Samuel Huntington [Cfr. Aleksandr Dugin, Multipolar World Theory, AGA Editrice, 2019, NdT]. But in the face of the signs of an emerging multipolarity, one thing is a trend, another is objective reality. It is like ice cracked in the spring - it is clear that it will not last long, but at the same time, it is undeniable that you can also move on it, even if you run some risk. Nobody can be sure when the cracked ice will actually give up.\nNow we can start a countdown to a multipolar world order and the starting point is the coronavirus epidemic. The pandemic has buried globalization, open society and the global capitalist system. The virus forced us on ice and the individual enclaves of humanity began to take their own isolated historical trajectories.\nCoronavirus has buried all the major myths of globalization:\n- the effectiveness of open borders and the interdependence of countries in the world,\n- the ability of supranational institutions to cope with an extraordinary situation,\n- the sustainability of the global financial system and the global economy as a whole, facing serious challenges,\n- the futility of centralized states, socialist regimes and disciplinary methods in solving acute problems and the total superiority of liberal strategies towards them,\n- the total triumph of liberalism as a panacea for all problematic situations.\nTheir solutions have not worked in Italy, nor in other European Union countries, nor in the United States. The only thing that proved effective was the clear closure of society, dependence on internal resources, the strong power of the state and the isolation of the sick from the healthy, citizens from foreigners, etc.\nAt the same time, Western countries also reacted to the pandemic in a very different way: the Italians introduced the total quarantine, Macron introduced a state dictatorship regime (in the Jacobin spirit), Merkel has allocated 500 billion euros to support the population, and Boris Johnson, following the spirit of Anglo-Saxon individualism, suggested that the disease should be considered a private matter affecting every English taken individually and refused to perform the swab tests, sympathizing in advance with those who lose loved ones. Trump established a state of emergency in the United States, closing connections with Europe and the rest of the world. If the West acts in such a disparate and contradictory way, what will become of the rest of the countries? Everyone seems to be saved as they can. This goal has been best achieved by China, which, thanks to the Communist Party's practical policies, has established strict disciplinary methods to combat contagion, accusing the United States of spreading it. The same accusation was made by Iran, which was hit hard by the virus - even among the leaders of the country.\nThus, the virus tore open society to pieces and pushed humanity forward on its path to a multipolar world.\nRegardless of how the fight against coronavirus will end, it is clear that globalization has collapsed. This could almost certainly mark the end of liberalism and its total ideological domination. It is difficult to predict the final version of the future world order - especially in its details. Multipolarism is a system that historically has never existed, and if we look for some remote analogy, we should not turn to the era of the more or less equivalent European states according to the Westphalian world, but to the period before the era of the Great Geographical Discoveries, when, together with Europe (divided into western and eastern Christian countries), the Islamic world, India, China and Russia existed as independent civilizations. The same civilizations existed in the pre-colonial period in America (the Incas, the Aztecs, etc.) and in Africa. There were links and contacts between these civilizations, but there was no single type of link with universal values, institutions and systems.\nThe post coronavirus world is likely to include individual regions of the world, civilizations, continents that are gradually transforming themselves into independent actors. At the same time, the universal model of liberal capitalism is likely to collapse. This model currently serves as the common denominator of the whole structure of unipolarity: from the absolutization of the market to parliamentary democracy and the ideology of human rights, including the notion of progress and the law of technological development which have risen to the rank of dogma in the 'Europe New Age (of the New Times) and have spread to all human societies through colonization (directly or indirectly in the form of westernization).\nMuch will depend on who defeats the epidemic and how: where disciplinary measures prove effective, they will enter the future political and economic order as an essential component. The same conclusion can be reached by those who, on the other hand, will not be able to face the threat of a pandemic through the opening and absence of severe measures. Temporary alienation dictated by the direct threat of contagion from another country and from another region, the breakdown of economic ties and the necessary alienation from a single financial system will force the states affected by the epidemic to seek self-sufficiency, because the priority will be food security, minimum autonomy and economic autarchy to meet the vital needs of the population, beyond any economic dogma considered essential before the coronavirus crisis. Even where liberalism and capitalism are preserved, they will be placed in a national framework in the spirit of mercantilist theories that insist on maintaining the monopoly of foreign trade in the hands of the state. Those who are less tied to the liberal tradition can very well move in the areas of the most optimal organization of the \"great space\" in other directions - taking into account the civilizational and cultural specificities.\nIt cannot be said in advance what the multipolar model as a whole will eventually become, but the very fact of breaking the universally binding dogma of liberal globalization will open up completely new opportunities and paths for each civilization.\nAfter the coronavirus: multipolar security\nThe multipolar world will create a completely new security architecture. It may not be more sustainable or adaptable to conflict resolution, but it will be different. In this new model, the West, the United States and NATO, if NATO still exists, will be only one factor among others. The United States itself will clearly not be able (and probably will not, if Trump's line eventually prevails in Washington) to play the role of sole global arbiter, and therefore the United States will acquire a different status after the quarantine and emergency state. It can be compared to Israel's role in the Middle East. Israel is undoubtedly a powerful country, which actively influences the balance of power in the region, but does not export its ideology and values to the surrounding Arab countries. On the contrary, it retains its Jewish identity for itself, rather trying to free itself from readers of other values rather than include them in its composition. The construction of a wall with Mexico and Trump's invitation to the Americans to focus on their internal problems is similar to Israel's path: the United States will be a powerful power, but its liberal-capitalist ideology will have value are for themselves , without attracting third parties. The same will apply to Europe. As a result, the most important factor in the unipolar world will radically change its status.\nThis, of course, will lead to a redistribution of forces and functions among other civilizations. Europe, if it maintains its unity in some way, is likely to create its own military blockade independent of the United States, which has already been mentioned after the collapse of the Soviet Union (the Eurocorps project) and to which Macron and Merkel have repeatedly mentioned. While not directly hostile to the United States, such a blockade will in many cases pursue purely European interests, which at times may differ significantly from those of the United States. This will primarily affect relations with Russia, Iran, China and the Islamic world.\nChina will have to transform itself from the beneficiary of globalization and adapt to pursue its national interests as a regional power. This is exactly what all the processes in China are heading towards lately - the strengthening of Xi Jianping's power, the \"One Belt One Road\" project, etc. It will no longer be a globalization with Chinese characteristics, but a project explicitly focused on the Far East with peculiar Confucian and partly socialist characteristics. Clearly, conflicts in the Pacific Ocean with the United States will worsen at some point.\nThe Islamic world will face a difficult problem linked to the new paradigm of self-organization, since in the conditions of formation of the great spaces - Europe, China, USA, Russia, etc. - the individual Islamic countries will not be fully commensurate with the rest and effectively defend their interests. There will be a need for several Islamic integration poles - Shiites (with the center in Iran) and Sunnis, where, together with Indonesia and Pakistan in the east, a western Sunni bloc will probably be built around Turkey and some Arab countries such as Egypt or the Gulf States.\nAnd finally, in the multipolar world order, Russia will have the historical possibility of strengthening itself as an independent civilization that will see its power increase following the strong decline of the West and its internal geopolitical fragmentation. But, at the same time, this will also represent a challenge: before establishing itself fully as one of the most influential and powerful poles of the multipolar world, Russia will have to pass the test of maturity, preserving its unity and reaffirming its areas of influence in the Eurasian space. It is not yet clear where the southern and western borders of Russia-Eurasia will be post coronavirus. This will largely depend on what regime, what methods and efforts Russia will use to deal with the pandemic and what political consequences this will have. Furthermore, it is impossible to predict the state of the other \"great spaces\" - the poles of the multipolar world - with knowledge. The establishment of the Russian perimeter will depend on many factors, some of which may prove to be rather acute and conflicting.\nGradually, a multipolar settlement system will be formed - both based on a UN reformed under the conditions of multipolarity, and in the form of some new organization. Again, it will all depend on how the fight against coronavirus will unfold.\nThe virus as a mission\nWithout pretense: the coronavirus pandemic represents a turning point in world history. Not only are stock indices and oil prices plummeting, the world order itself is also plummeting. We live in the period that marks the end of liberalism and its \"obviousness\" as a global meta-narrative, the end of its dispositions and standards. Human societies will soon become freely floating: no more dogmas, no more imperialism than the dollar, no more spells of the free market, no more dictatorship than the Fed or global exchanges, no more enslavement to the world media elite. Each pole will build its future on its civilization foundations. It is obviously impossible to say what this will look like or what it will bring. However, it is already quite clear that the old world order is becoming a heritage of the past, and the distinct outlines of a new reality are emerging before us.\nWhat neither ideologies, nor wars, nor bitter economic conflicts, nor terror, nor religious movements have been able to do, has been accomplished by an invisible but deadly virus. It brought with it death, suffering, horror, panic, pain ... but also the future.\nTranslation by Donato Mancuso"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1p-5LEHF5E&t=265", "title": "Coronavirus - a new technology of \"color revolutions\".

Perhaps it is precisely the coronavirus epidemic that will become that Event.\nIt is too early to draw accurate conclusions, but some processes in geopolitics and ideology have already rapidly passed the point of no return.\nFirst: the coronavirus epidemic is the end of globalization. An open society is an infection. Anyone who wants to demolish borders is preparing the territory for the total extermination of humanity. You can, of course, grin, but people in white antiviral coats will stop inappropriate laughter. Only closedness can save. Closure in every sense - closed borders, closed economies, closed provision of goods and products. Fichte called it a \"closed merchant state.\" Soros must be lynched, and Fichte to erect a monument. First lesson.\nSecond: the coronavirus closes the page of liberalism. Liberalism facilitates the spread of the virus - in every sense. It requires the demolition of any differences. Liberalism is the virus. A little more time will pass, and the liberals will be equated with \"lepers\", with infectious \"maniacs\", who call to dance and have fun in the midst of the plague. The liberal is the coronavirus peddler, his apologist. Especially if it turns out what’s the matter, that it was created in the \"citadel of liberalism\" of the USA as a biological weapon. Lesson two: liberalism kills.\nThird: the criteria for success and sustainability of countries and societies are changing dramatically. In the battle with the epidemic, neither Chinese wealth, nor the European social system, nor the absence of a social system in the USA, which at the same time have the greatest military and financial power, can save it. Even the Iranian spiritual-vertical regime does not help. Coronavirus cut off the entire top of civilization - oil, finance, free exchange, the market, the total domination of the Fed ... World leaders are helpless. Completely different criteria come to the fore:\n· Possession of antivirus and\n· The ability to autonomously provide life for themselves and loved ones in conditions of maximum closeness.\nBut that means reassessing all values. A vaccine is the destiny of those who most likely developed the virus, and this is something unreliable. But closeness and the transition to self-sufficiency - many can do it. But this requires multipolarity. Small-scale farming and barter will be saving in the conditions of the total collapse of everything.\nSo, what logical should have come after the triumphal procession on the planet coronavirus? In the best case, the emergence of several relatively closed world zones - civilizations, large spaces, or - in the worst case - Mad Max and Resident Evil. The Russian series \"Epidemic\" is becoming a reality before our eyes.\nGods of the plague\nI am beginning to understand why in some societies the plague gods were worshiped and worshiped. The advent of the plague allows you to completely renew the life of societies. The epidemic has no logic and spares neither the noble, nor the rich, nor the imperious. It destroys all indiscriminately, and returns people to the simple fact of being. The plague gods are the fairest. This was written by Antonin Artaud, comparing the theater with the plague. The goal of the theater, according to Artaud, with all possible cruelty, to return a person to the fact that he is, is here and now, which he stubbornly and persistently seeks to forget. Plague is an existential phenomenon. The Greeks called Apollo Sminfey, \"Mouse\" and attributed to him the power of his arrows to bring plague. With this begins, as everyone knows, the Iliad.\nThis is what Apollo would do if he looked at modern humanity - bankers, bloggers, rappers, deputies, office workers, migrants, feminists? ... That's it ...\nBunuel has the movie \"Angel Fighter\" - about this.\nSo the world ends\nOne can imagine the more man-made nature of the epidemic, either allowing the West to use the virus against its geopolitical opponents (this explains China and Iran, but does not explain Italy and everyone else) or even the start of targeted extermination of all these extra billions by a small circle of humanity with a vaccine which spawned \"progress\" and \"open society.\" In this case, the “gods of the plague\" may turn out to be quite specific representatives of the world financial elite, which has long recognized the \"limits of growth.\" But even in this case - especially if this is not the beginning of a full-fledged global genocide, but only a test of the pen - the conclusion is the same: those who pretend to be responsible for human societies are not the ones they want to look like. Liberalism is only an excuse for mass extermination, such as the colonization and spread of the standards of modern Western civilization throughout humanity. Global elites and their local puppets may be counting on surviving the vaccine, but something tells us that this is where the catch lies. And the virus can behave inappropriately, and the processes that began in civilization, and even individual unpredictable spontaneous events, can disrupt a carefully thought-out plan.\nIt may be that the whole world economy will not collapse within a few months, but this is precisely the point.\nEverything that modern people consider “sustainable” and “reliable” is a pure illusion. And coronavirus demonstrates this clearly and vividly. In fact, it’s worth a little bit to continue the logic of what happens next, and we see how the world ends - at least the world that we know and knew. And the first outlines of something else appear.\nMatter in danger\nIt is curious that in parallel with the coronavirus, which has become, in a sense, the subject of civilization, discussions in the scientific community about “bubbles of nothing” broke out, reviving some hypotheses of the famous physicist Edward Witten, one of the main theorists of “superstrings”.\nAccording to the ideas of modern physicists, “bubbles are nothing” can arise from a “false vacuum”, that is, a vacuum that has not reached stability, but only pretends that it has reached. In a ten-dimensional world (with 4 ordinary dimensions and 6 more dimensions present via compactification), such “nothing bubbles” are quite likely. If they arise, they suck galaxies into nothing and may well swallow the Universe. These whirlpools of the unstable vacuum are impressive.\nAnd again, as in the case of coronavirus, “they say nothing bad happens, everything is under control”, representatives of the academic scientific elites reassure us: the chance of the appearance of “nothing bubbles” is ridiculously small.\nBut it seems to me that this is not so. That he, on the contrary, is very significant. The modern world is partly such a “nothing bubble” that is growing rapidly, absorbing meanings and dissolving being. And liberalism and globalization are his most vivid expressions. Coronavirus also has a “nothing bubble”.\nNature itself is also interesting (I hate this concept - “nature”, nothing more meaningless exists) of the virus. He is something between a living being - he has DNA or RNA - and a mineral (he has no cell). But most of all, it resembles a neural network and even Artificial Intelligence. It is either there, or not, or living, or inanimate ... That is precisely what the “nonequilibrium vacuum” is, which creates “nothing bubbles”.\nWe believe that the vacuum of the Universe is equilibrium, that is, the whole cycle of possible entropy has passed. What if he only pretends to be so ...\nWhen you hear the story of the Wuhan market, you imagine the bats fighting with poisonous snakes, and their fierce exchange of infection and deadly microscopic arrows of nonexistence, having the shape of a crown, it is impossible to get rid of the image of “nothing bubbles”. Reports about falling oil prices and the collapse of stock market indices evoke the same feeling. Even a war - with its specifics and existential awakening - does not save anything from attacks, because the motivation of modern wars is so deeply mired in some material, financial, oil, corruption interests, having lost its original purity - a direct and immediate encounter with death. And it only serves as “nothing bubbles”, fulfilling their instructions to lead the matter to total abolition.\nPlague as an Event\nIs it possible to count that, if this happens, mankind will cope with the coronavirus, curtail globalization, throw out liberal superstitions, stop migrants, put an end to obscene technical inventions that plunge people deeper into the endless labyrinths of matter? Clearly, no. Immediately everyone will return to the old. Without blinking an eye, and not having time to bury corpses. As soon as - and if only - the markets revive and the Dow Jones comes to their senses, everything will return to normal. The one who thinks otherwise is exactly naive. But what does this mean? This means that an epidemic as an Event will turn into an annoying misunderstanding. No one will understand the meaning of the coming of the gods of the plague, no one will think about \"bubbles nothing.\" This means that everything will be repeated again and again and will be repeated until the moment until it reaches the point of no return.\nIf you pay attention to the passage of time, this point is being overcome at the moment."}, {"url":

Bill Gates is the New World Order’s equivalent of a chief science officer. As such, his top priority is depopulation. His stated method is vaccines. Bill is walking in his fathers footsteps, who was also tasked with depopulation while head of Planned Parenthood (47). A proud legacy of eugenicists.\nOn January 9, 2020, the UN announced that the Wuhan Coronavirus had a lot of similarities to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) (1)(2).\nA Coronavirus is a virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. It can lead to pneumonia (4)(5). Most Coronaviruses are not dangerous. Some types of them are serious, such as MERS and SARS (6). The name comes from the crown-like appearance the virus displays.\nOn May 4, 2013, the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg MB, Canada, received the novel Coronavirus from the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Dr. Frank Plummer confirmed this in a CTV article from May 14, 2013 (7).\nThese two pdf files from the World Health Organization shows recent collaboration between the Eramus Medical Center in the Netherlands and teams working on the current novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China.\nA CBC article from May 19, 2013, confirms the virus sent to National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg was a Saudi sample. Dr. Plummer of NML, said that they were unable to share it with other researchers because of Dutch restrictions. The Saudi researcher, Ali Mohamed Zaki, who first spotted the Coronavirus in 2012 in the lab of Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah and then sent a sample to the Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia was fired.\nA year later, Dr. Plummer left the National Microbiology Lab in Canada after 14 years (9). It is noteworthy to mention that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded Dr. Plummer’s HIV research as well as the research of other prominent Canadian scientists, Dr. Lorn Babiuk and Dr. Brett Finlay, who received in total 436.6 million in research funds (10).\nThere’s no indication however, of any connection between that and the Coronavirus. What is relevant however is that Dr. Plummer has now openly admitted to being a long-term alcoholic while working at the level 4 containment laboratory that required the highest level of safety clearance. He is undergoing electrical stimulation of the brain for alcoholism. He is also preparing to push ahead with an experimental vaccine against HIV infection, and is working on writing a memoir.\nCanadian scientist undergoes novel brain stimulation treatment for alcoholism:\nPlummer has also stated that while he was the head of the National Microbiology Lab of Canada, he didn’t generally supervise the work (46). He said, as director of the lab he “basically set people free to do their jobs. And I tried to run interference for them, and get them the money that they needed for them to do their jobs well — and it worked!”\nHe set them free? Just who exactly was running that lab?\nRecently a researcher with ties to China was recently escorted out of the National Microbiology Lab (NML) in Winnipeg amid an RCMP investigation into what’s being described as a possible “policy breach.” Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, her husband Keding Cheng, and an unknown number of her students from China were removed from Canada’s only level-4 lab on July 5, 2019. A Level 4 virology facility is a lab equipped to work with the most serious & deadly human and animal diseases (12)(13).\nIn 2014, Dr. Xiangguo Qiu and a research team at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Canada that created a drug (ZMAPP) that could treat Ebola (14). Shortly after, many companies started clinical trials for Ebola vaccines, some of which were founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Some of these companies include: Novavax, and Mabworks among others (15).\nThe Council on Foreign Relations reported on June 16, 2017, some of the highlights and connections between a few of the drug manufacturers. It appears as though the Chinese military got their hands on ZMAPP through a Beijing company called Mabworks and were in violation of copy write infringement (16). When asked by the US Department of Defense, Mabworks they stated they had a licensing agreement with the intellectual property rights holder for ZMAPP. Mabworks later admitted they had duplicated the drug without authorization (12).\nThis PDF Document highlights the connection between the Chinese Military and Mabworks. The drug consists of three monoclonal antibodies, two of which were originally developed with support from U.S. and Canadian military research agencies. Put differently, the U.S. government and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada hold patents for two of the antibodies in ZMAPP. As a result, government officials expressed patent infringement concerns (16). But who provided them with the research data to do so?\nThis National Post article explains how Dr. Qiu and her co-worker worked for the Chinese firm Mabworks while they were doing research for the National Microbiology Laboratory in Canada, employed by the Canadian Government. They insist that they did nothing untoward by giving the Ebola vaccine over to the Chinese authorities because it was about saving lives (17).\n(ref)\nIn 2019, security access for the Dr. Qui, her husband and Chinese students working at the National Laboratory Institution was revoked and Dr. Oui was dismissed and her ties with the University of Manitoba were cut. Inside sources, fearful of retribution and wanting to remain anonymous had this to say (18)(12):\nThere have always been questions about Qiu’s trips to China — and what information and technology she was sharing with researchers there. “It’s not right that she’s a Canadian government employee providing details of top-secret work and know-how to set up a high-containment lab for a foreign nation,” one employee said. The staff member claims RCMP officers have not yet interviewed key people at the lab, because senior management has not made them accessible to police or allowed staff to contact them with relevant information.\nCiting privacy concerns, neither the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) nor the RCMP are providing further details. There is speculation that the group facilitated the unauthorized transfer of research and biological materials to China which may include the sharing of Ebola, as well as a second pathogen. The potential transfer of knowledge and pathogens to China may be advancing their biological weapons program (19)(20)(12).\nThe only lab in China with level 4 clearance that does research with deadly pathogens is Wuhan National Biosafety Lab located in the city where the outbreak has started (21). As previously reported, Dr. Xiangguo Qui, who was dismissed from the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, trained staff at this laboratory in Wuhan.\nAccording to travel documents obtained through an access to information request, Dr. Oui made at least five trips to China in 2017-18, including one to train scientists and technicians at this site. These trips were funded by a “third party” and the identity of the third party was redacted. During a Sept. 19-30, 2017, trip, she also met with collaborators in Beijing, the documents say, but their names have also been blacked out (18)(12).\nOn a side note: Remember Novavax that created the Ebola vaccine? Apparently they are now creating a vaccine for this Wuhan Coronavirus. Look how much their stock jumped in value when they announced they were developing the vaccine; 71% is a pretty health investment!\nThe top Institutional shareholders for Novavax are shown here and they includes: the Vanguard Group (Rothschild), BlackRock (China) and the Munich-based company called Allianz (22). Allianz has been in China since 1917 and has formed several partnerships including one with CITIC Group owned by the People’s Republic of China (23)(24) and a founding partner of the Canada China Business Council (25)(12)(26).\n(ref)\nMabworks parent company is Guotai Junan Securities. In 2002, Guotai Junan Securities and Allianz partnered to form Guo’an Fund Management (27)(28)(12). What does this mean? In layman’s terms: Novavax is partly owned by Allianz who also tied to the Chinese firm Mabworks; the same Chinese company that Chinese Scientist Dr. Qui provided research for while working for the Canadian government; the same Chinese scientist who set up the level 4 research lab in Wahan China located at the epicenter of the outbreak; the very same Chinese scientist currently under RCMP investigation for possible pathogen and intellectual property theft (19)(12). And Novavax just announced they are working on the Coronavirus Vaccine. Allianz, the institutional owner of Novavax and has also partnered with Bill Gates’ Microsoft to digitally transform the insurance industry and on other health-related initiatives (29)(30). But maybe this is all a just coincidence?\nNovavax has also received millions in funding for research from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to help develop vaccines for global health issues, specifically for treating pneumonia (31)(32)(33)(34).\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also co-hosted a pandemic exercise in late 2019 in late 2019 that simulated a global coronavirus outbreak. Their simulation predicted that it could kill 65 million people within the year (35)(36)(37)! Another coincidence (38)?\n(ref)\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also fund the UK-based Pirbright Institute (39). The Pirbright Institute has been in existence for over 100 years. It was first established as a cattle testing station for tuberculosis in 1914 and has developed over the years to become one of the UK’s leading virus diagnostics and surveillance centers and is now also at the forefront of virus research (40).\nThe Pirbright Institute has held the patent to this deadly Coronavirus since 2015 (41). On June 19, 2015, Pirbright Institute filed an application for a patent for the live coronavirus, which was approved on Nov 20, 2018 (42).\nA coalition led by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is currently leading a group of scientist working on a vaccine to solve this Coronavirus crisis (43). The question left unanswered is, who caused this crisis?\nBill Gate’s position on climate change and lowering CO2 emissions are based on population control. In this video, he openly admits that vaccines will be used to lower population:\n“If we do a really good job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services we could lower that (population) by 10-15%.”\nGates is also an advocate of Voluntary Euthanasia also know as “Death Panels” where bureaucrats decide if an individual is worthy of health care or not. With the Coronavirus outbreak the balance of life, or death remains in the hands of those with the vaccine (44). God help us all!\nThis story will not end well.

Part of it comes from the Sun and the outer universe, here we are talking about \"cosmic rays\".\nIf we look at the classic book From Molecules to Man (От молекул до человека, Moscow 1973 / translation of the American original): “Radiation or radiation acts on cells, on cellular DNA. In this way, it also affects the internal organs,… it causes oncological diseases. Upon complete irradiation, cell degeneration occurs. In general: the effect of ionizing radiation is twofold: both cells disintegrate and their mutations occur, which can manifest themselves (either directly, ed. Note) or only in future generations. ”(Abbreviated)\nThe fact that radiation works is confirmed by the equally classic book Biology (Мир, 1968 / Claude A. Villee, Harvard University, 1967 /): “Cosmic rays that fall on Earth can cause some spontaneous mutations; other mutations arise as a result of random errors that accompany the process of gene replication… ”(p. 534).\nCOVID-19 and cosmic rays?\nOn the issue of wave and particle radiation, the Sputnik reporter instructed Ing. Stanislav Fischer, CSc., Resp. we asked, what is KS - cosmic rays?\nIng. Stanislav Fischer, CSc .: For me I can talk about cosmic rays. Our Sun (as a cosmic body, ed. Note) shines in all fields of the spectrum, including X-rays. In fact, it emits both wave (electromagnetic) and particle radiation simultaneously. Cosmic radiation is therefore a broad concept. For example, X-rays are not particulate, they are electromagnetic waves (wave radiation, ed. Note). On the contrary, particle radiation is given by a stream of protons, electrons, nuclei ...\nOur star, I read with Jiří Grygar in the book The Universe (1979, p. 99), belongs to the \"band of the main sequence\" (spectral class G2V) according to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram…\nYes. This means that it is characterized by a slight warming that does not destroy everything alive on Earth. The mild and stable performance of our star, aka the Sun, just makes life on Earth possible… Life itself has various forms, one of the manifestations of life is the viruses…\nWhat role does the atmosphere play in absorbing radiation, or when people pollute it, does it have any effect on radiation?\nThe Earth's atmosphere is a duvet that absorbs radiation. Our atmosphere is not so dense, it does not absorb everything. If it were denser, it would be less permeable ... Fortunately, most of the harmful radiation is still absorbed, especially low-energy particles.\nRather, civilization pollution makes life miserable for biological species. Our own energy sources do not have the power to affect solar activity or the amount of particles released by the sun. What changes the intensity of radiation are the cycles of solar activity. These are periods of various lengths, even several years, which are related to the solar physiology itself.\nIf you asked me if radiation is responsible for mutations in the life of organisms, then yes. But we must say that the mutation also causes radiation emitted from human sources, including nuclear weapons. All this affects the genetic information of the species. But it's a question for biologists… When radiation is too much, we talk about conditions incompatible with life.\nMutations and cosmic rays\nA Sputnik reporter tried to find out if the coronavirus mutations or the fact of its existence could be related to cosmic rays. There are definitely scientific articles on radiation and influenza virus (H1N1): \"Subsequently, the influenza virus further mutated due to a heavy spray of cosmic rays…\"\nSources state that the influence of radiation is still intensively studied and cannot be neglected, as well as another phenomenon, which is the effect of 5G networks. There are also studies that talk about the effect of cosmic radiation on mutations in other viruses (see Zika virus).\nIs COVID-19 spread due to the weakened immunity of the world's population?\nIn Sputnik, we recently had an interview with MUDr. Marek Obrtel, who spoke about the shortage of drugs in the Czech Republic, did not fit into Obrtel's thoughts on whether or not to vaccinate the population. We called him again. We have now learned that only \"responsibility, discipline, isolation and quarantine of contacts\" will help with the current virus. The doctor confirmed that we are generally weakening ourselves by \"eating antibiotics almost voluntarily\". He also admitted that there are new types of viruses where there is no choice but to develop antibodies, but it would be better for a globally resilient population of people.\nWe also asked MVDr. Miroslav Safar. We contacted the veterinarian because the coronavirus has been known to report to them, the veterinarian, for a long time. COVID-19 is a disease that has crossed the species barrier. Therefore, it is as if new to a person and causes at least some helplessness…\nOpinion of MVDr. Miroslav Šafář: First, the effect of radiation on mutations and thus on human health is proven. More than that, natural radiation is different in different parts of the world, just as water quality is different ... Only the impact of travel from place to place can be seen at the cellular level. Cells that have previously been adapted to a specific environment are subject to change. As people travel, the body receives another form of unconscious stress, which can manifest itself in reduced immunity. Yes, reduced immunity is a big problem today, there is a connection with drug overuse.\nAs a veterinarian, I can confirm that we have been experiencing coronavirus for years. The current form of the new coronavirus is a serious phenomenon. I consider the factors that you discuss in this article, which are either behind the RNA virus itself or that make a person less resistant to the virus, to be relevant. It is not excluded that when some time has passed and we will look at COVID-19 retrospectively, we will be quite surprised. But let's wait.\nThe Sputnik reporter thanks all the participating respondents - I would like to wish everyone a lot of patience in the current measures that are being undertaken in the Czech Republic in connection with COVID-19. As part of this, I also wish all readers and people of good will good health.\nThe views expressed in this article may not always be in line with Sputnik's position."}, {"url": "https://www.ibb-press.net/news133655.html", "title": "Russia repelled the most dangerous epidemic of Corona!

However, little is reported about this, other than annual recommendations for a flu shot, sponsored by Big Pharma.\nNatural News calls them \"the greatest medical fraud in the history of the world.\" Why?\nBecause \"they contain more than 50 ppm of mercury, an extremely toxic heavy metal associated with kidney failure, birth defects, miscarriage, and neurological damage.\"\nThe same is true of other vaccines, potentially more dangerous than the diseases they are intended to protect against.\nThey are a bonanza for Big Pharma. On February 1, CNBC reported that \"(i) biotech investors (are rushing) (are) working on the coronavirus vaccine (s).\"\nA dozen or more companies are working on its development, clinical trials will begin in a few months, the potential for profit is enormous. When approved for sale, they will be marketed worldwide and promoted through advertising.\nOn Monday, Natural News reported that the coronavirus was \"designed by scientists in a laboratory using well-documented genetic engineering vectors that leave a 'fingerprint', adding:\n\"(L) WHO and CDC are covering up this inconvenient fact ...\"\nLaw professor Francis Boyle drafted the 1989 United States Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act, enacted by GHW Bush, repealed by Bush / Cheney under the guise of rebuilding America's defenses at a time when the only enemies of the nation.

The China Center for Disease Control and Prevention is working on the development of a vaccine.\nIn 2003, the media spread fear propaganda about a SARS pandemic proven to be overblown, 800 deaths reported after the hysteria subsided.\nIn the same year, 42,643 people in the United States died in 6,328,000 police-reported car accidents, 2,889,000 people injured.\nIn 2009, the WHO falsely predicted a global H1N1 swine flu pandemic that could affect \"up to two billion people in the next two years.\"\nAt the time, evidence suggested that the H1N1 strain was bioengineered in a US laboratory. In the USA, the vaccines produced for her are extremely dangerous and potentially lethal.\nThere was no national or global emergency. No pandemic or epidemic occurred. The CDC estimated that 8,330 to 17,160 deaths resulted from the strain.\nAt the time, the theme of fear was intended to convince people to take experimental, untested, toxic, and extremely dangerous vaccines that can damage the human immune system and cause health problems ranging from annoying to life-threatening.\nA similar scenario is at stake today. The vaccines could be brought to market, Big Pharma promoting their use.\nThe United States has had an active biological warfare program since at least the 1940s.\nIn 1941, he implemented a secret program to develop offensive and supposedly defensive biological weapons using controversial testing methods.\nDuring World War II, the US Chemical Warfare Services. USA Experiments with mustard gas began in about 4,000 servicemen.\nIn 1945, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) implemented \"Program F\".\nIt was the largest study in the United States on the health effects of fluoride, a key chemical component in the production of atomic bombs.\nIt is one of the most toxic chemicals known, with the risk of damaging the central nervous system.\nHowever, low amounts of concentration are found in drinking water and toothpaste, little or nothing reported officially or by establishment media on their toxicity.\nSince at least the 1940s, VA patients have been guinea pigs for medical experiments.\nThe Pentagon previously launched biological agents in US cities. USA To know the effects of the germ war in populated areas, tests carried out in secret.\nIn 1953, the CIA launched the MKULTRA Project, a multi-year research program to evaluate drugs and biological agents for mind control and behavior modification, using involuntary human subjects.\nFrom the 1960s, at least until the 1980s, the United States used biological agents against Cuba.\nDuring the Vietnam War, the Pentagon's use of the highly toxic Agent Orange and sarin nerve gas killed, disabled, or caused chronic illness for millions, primarily civilians.\nIn all the wars of the EE. In the US, prohibited radiological, chemical, biological, and other weapons are used, inflicting a devastating cost on people in selected areas.\nIs the coronavirus a biological weapon as Francis Boyle believes? Most likely, it will be contained in the coming weeks, the reported number of infected individuals decreases, not increases.\nWhen all is said and done, the constant fight against fear will likely prove to be a bonanza for Big Pharma.\nAs for the coronavirus, it may end in a footnote to medical history: Thousands of people affected in China, not millions, mainly in and around Wuhan, small numbers elsewhere.\nStephen Lendman, born in 1934 in Boston, began writing about major world and national issues beginning in the summer of 2005.

While China has for the most part coped with the outbreak of a new disease, and Russia and other post-Soviet countries are successfully struggling with the spread of coronavirus, Europeans in the world are increasingly seen as plagued by plague. Especially pathetic and helpless in an emergency situation are EU structures that simply fell into prostration. The coronavirus epidemic raises the question of the future of the European Union: can this project continue to exist if it is so obviously unable to meet the challenges of the times?\nUS President Donald Trump for a month banned entry into America from Europe. The ban applies to residents of all EU countries. In an appeal to the nation, Trump ruthlessly stated that the European Union “could not take the same precautions as the United States.”\nChina introduces entry restrictions for residents of European countries for fear of contracting a Chinese-born coronavirus. The fact is that in China the epidemic has begun to decline. Celestial authorities say that the spread of the pandemic was stopped: almost all new cases of Chinese infection with the coronavirus were caused by contacts with foreigners from Iran, South Korea or Europe.\nNow for the whole world, not China, but Europe is the main cause of the headache due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe countries with the fastest rates of spread of the disease to date: Italy, Iran, South Korea, France, Spain, Germany. The European Union as a whole on the scale of the problem is already giving odds to China.\nRussia and China have four thousand kilometers of a common border, and currently in Russia 28 cases of coronavirus have been detected. Italy and China not only have no border - Italy is on the other end of Eurasia from China. Nevertheless, there are already more than 12 thousand cases of coronavirus.\nWorld media outlets publish apocalyptic stories about empty Italian streets, empty shops, closed restaurants and storming train stations for people fleeing big cities. However, all these measures had to be taken before the epidemic, and not after it.\nInstead, a week ago, the City Hall of Milan organized a free aperitif in the central square under the slogan “Say no to the virus!” Let's say no to panic! ” The mayor of the city, along with everyone, drank beautiful Italy, clinked a cocktail with the secretary of his party, and then it turned out that he had a coronavirus, and thousands of participants in the mass festivities overtook him.\nThe emergency situation with the new infection revealed the monstrously low level of managerial culture and responsibility of the European elites, their strategic carelessness, and the inability to adequately assess the situation, quickly respond to it, make correct forecasts and plan their actions.\nAll the actions that are now being taken in the European Union are being taken too late. Austria closed the border with Italy too late. Germany mobilized the healthcare system too late. Poland introduced border controls too late. By then, the infection had spread everywhere, and a pandemic had already occurred.\nAt the beginning of this dramatic story, China mobilized a government system and managed to localize the virus in the region where it was discovered. The EU in a similar situation allowed the spread of the virus from the epicenter of infection to its entire territory. The question is, which of the two represents a genuine threat to global security?\nThe place of the European Union as an organization in the history of coronavirus is a topic for another discussion. There is simply no EU in this story.\nEuropean countries seemed to have forgotten that they are part of one integration association, and act on the principle of \"everyone dies alone.\"\nNational states fight the coronavirus exclusively on their own. We are not talking about coordination of efforts at the Brussels level. About pan-European mobilization and integration of health systems into a single headquarters for the fight against coronavirus - even more so.\nNo European solidarity is visible either when it really comes to a common misfortune. It would seem so natural. The Italian health system collapsed from overload, there are no one to diagnose and treat new patients, and from this the coronavirus is rapidly spreading throughout Europe. Let other European countries, where the number of cases have not yet reached catastrophic numbers, come to the aid of the Allies and send their doctors to Italy. Firstly, it is in their interests. Secondly, that same solidarity.\nNothing of the kind happens in practice. The same Baltic countries are very fond of talking about European solidarity, when they require subsidies from the European funds, but in the situation with the coronavirus they seem to have forgotten that they are members of the EU. However, everyone else too.\nPerhaps tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, Europeans will come to their senses from the first shock and realize that their behavior is unprofitable for them, and the image of the “single European family” in the rest of the world is simply awful. However, no matter what resolutions on the unity of all people of good will before common challenges are adopted in the European Parliament, whatever campaigns of solidarity are carried out, the very first, instinctive reaction to an emergency is always the most revealing.\nThe reaction to coronavirus showed that Europeans do not have any European Union in their heads: when it comes to the matter, this alliance ceases to exist as a political reality.\nThe 21st century has repeatedly proved that present-day Europe is in principle incapable of being a significant global player, much less a world leader, because it cannot adequately respond to the geopolitical and military challenges of our time. In this regard, the phenomenal disorder of European politicians in the history of the coronavirus did not open new depths of understanding.\nAnother thing is that the crisis with coronavirus has discovered: in the realities of the 21st century, the European Union simply ceases to exist."}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1hivpsT8ek&t=580", "title": "The situation in Ukraine may be worse than in Italy - Alexey Zhuravko", "text": "LEARN MORE ON THE REFERENCE: https: //news-front.info/2020/03/26/si ...\n#Juravko, #Ukraine, #cronavirus\nIn the studio of the program \"Actually\" with the ex-People's Deputy of Ukraine Alexey Zhuravko discussed the laws adopted in Ukraine during the epidemic of coronavirus.\nThe administration of the Ukrainian president issued a decree on the complete readiness to provide free assistance for the APU to civilians in connection with the spread of coronavirus.

Last August, a wave of pneumonia and diseases similar to the symptoms of the Corona virus, attributed to the repercussions of electronic cigarettes, but this hypothesis raised the suspicions of some experts. After that, media and activists in China reported that five of the Americans participating in the Al The international military father that Wuhan hosted last October was infected with an unspecified infection. The Chinese sources suggested that this mysterious disease was in fact \"Coffed-19\" that he transferred to Wuhan, an American military, and he may have been injured by an accident not announced in Fort Detrick, He was not diagnosed with any visible symptoms."}, {"url": "https://novorosinform.org/808651", "title": "Alexander Artamonov: NATO uses COVID-19 to mobilize Western forces against Russia", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic announced by the World Health Organization is designed to mobilize Western forces against Russia. However, the Western \"non-brothers\" each time forget that the state \"in the gun\" is a normal state for the Russians. This opinion was expressed in a conversation with the Novorossia news agency by a military observer Alexander Artamonov.\nHe recalled that for some reason, in the presence of such terrible diseases in the world as tuberculosis, measles and so on, worldwide hysteria began precisely because of coronavirus.\nIA Novorossiya: In your opinion, will the situation with coronavirus affect Russia's relations with NATO in any way? Maybe taking advantage of the situation, NATO decides to attack? Or, on the contrary, will weaken?\nAlexander Artamonov: The situation with the coronavirus is more likely to affect the cohesion of the bloc against us. That is, the coronavirus has a goal, and in this case, in order not to rely solely on some fabrications, I will refer to the opinion of the former adviser Francois Mitterrand Jacques Attali (this is a large value in France, one of, say, the arbiters, geopoliticians, large and rich people). In his blog for March 17, he spoke out that the coronavirus would serve to create a world government - that is, when he says “world government”, it means the western government. This is the unity of the people of the Western world, the unity of the bloc against us. And in this case, indeed, the mobilization measures associated with the coronavirus are actually training for war. Why am I saying that? Because in the world there are enough such terrible epidemics as tuberculosis, for example, which, incidentally, takes away one and a half million lives every year. Even a simple influenza virus - about 150 thousand is the \"normal\" number of victims of a \"normal\" strain of the virus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), up to 650 thousand people die from respiratory diseases annually. Any infectious disease specialist will confirm these data, they are freely available.\nMoreover, I will say that measles in Ukraine claimed the lives of several tens of thousands of children in 2015, and for this reason no one announced a general mobilization. Therefore, of course, this is training and Attali is right that in 2003 the measures taken by the world community began at a rather higher level of mobilization relative to the events before 2003. In 2003, there was a previous virus, which we all feared terribly. Therefore, I believe that yes, coronavirus will help Westerners to consolidate their efforts against us. Why am I telling Westerners? Because the viruses are still, though from Wuhan, but, in fact, not quite from there. From a social point of view, as a threat to humanity, it arose with the help of the World Health Organization and the UN, which is based in New York. It was the Western media that fanned universal hysteria, and by the way, the Chinese put it on the brakes. There is still some evidence of the artificial origin of the coronavirus, which serves the cause of the general mobilization of Westerners. Nuremberg television translated material that spoke about the study of two virologists - the British Lions Valera and Alan Kentwell, who proved that the virus was of artificial origin, a segment of DNA was built into it that served as a bridge between the animal and man. This was proved on the basis of 107 different samples that they took from sick people, and no one has denied this (and these data, I emphasize, from the Western community). Therefore, the artificial nature of this infection, which, let’s say, today is not so virulent as to arrange some kind of dress rehearsal of the plague, just allows us to talk more about the social side of the issue. This social side of the issue is the mobilization of the whole world. Against who? The goal is one - unfortunately, this is Russia.\nAs for Trump, he, of course, is in the know, because he said that the virus for some reason will recede in April. Why? Did someone tell him about this? Again, incomprehensible. That is, I believe that yes, the topic of the virus will play a role for NATO, but how quickly will this happen? I think that in Brussels, as Attali says, everything will happen quickly - that is, now everyone will be called to order. They will simply have more strict controllability due to the virus through the Brussels-national governments, which, in particular, began to travel to Crimea very often. This applies to French parliamentarians, and even members of the government, and, by the way, Italians. So now, probably, it will be more difficult for them to do this.\nIA Novorossiya: Considering all of the above, what have you said on your account, is Russia ready, say, to meet the enemy? Is she strong today? Or is he in a weak state?\nAA: Russia is in a very strong condition - fully mobilized. During the 20th century, we have developed an absolutely non-European culture of mobilization. If we take everything that we had to go through ... Europeans, regarding us, are just children. In the truest sense of the word.\nThe “arms” state is the normal state of the Russian, Russian people, in principle, since the time of Nicholas I, who said that Russians are best able to cope with impossible situations and that any wars will mobilize us. I’ll add from myself that wars, including information wars and even more direct threats at the borders. Therefore we are strong. And I say this not because I am Russian - in principle, this is quite provable things. Remember at least the situation in the 90s.\nAgain, there are different kinds of dangers, but even the way we reacted to at least the so-called coronavirus epidemic proves that we are strong in the face of challenges. We did not arrange hysteria and all that is happening in Australia and even in Paris. I’m not talking about the abstract - I have good friends both there and there who send me information about how Australian stores are stormed, about how they panic in Paris. The panic is such that at airports people are simply choking, trying to fly anywhere. By the way, Russia is now a popular destination among the French. It is believed that our country is a certain center of peace and proper organization of the world.\nIndeed, Russia without panic has long passed to general mobilization. In a sense, this is comparable to the state of Israel. That is, if you come to Israel, you will see that people there seem to rest on the beaches, and the country is open for tourists, but we know that the Israelis are constantly mobilized. For us, the inhabitants of Russia, the culture is even deeper than that of Israel and the ability to mobilize higher is only in the Donbass, which, by the way, I do not separate from the Russian world.\nIA Novorossiya: In your opinion, in connection with the current situation in the world, can the West forget about Ukraine for a while (in terms of helping it, and so on)?\nAA: No, the West cannot forget anything. He will certainly continue to support it, because there are concluded agreements. For the West, commerce is at the first level, and “all sorts of” human rights, and so on, are generally ridiculous for him regarding the interests and benefits, as they say, of a gesheft. In this regard, of course, all agreements will be valid. The Kiev junta is specifically a Western project, I am convinced that this is not a project of the Ukrainian people. Therefore, all deliveries will go, bases will be built, and so on.\nAnother thing is that the situation for Ukrainians will be somewhat worse, simply because a panic can really begin. We saw this very well on the example of the situation with Ukrainian citizens evacuated from Wuhan, when their compatriots offered to burn them. By the way, this situation even concerned the Kiev suburbs, where they also tried to place people in quarantine of people who had come from Wuhan. In this regard, Ukraine will be somewhat more difficult to cope with its own regions. The country is already on the verge of collapse, and Westerners naturally, as in the times of the Entente (remember the Russian Empire in the era of the civil war) will try to take the situation by any means.\nHowever, there is one more point - I believe that Donbass is now at a very favorable time to strengthen its borders. In my opinion, the Ukrainian side will now be much less organized and listen less to Westerners. Perhaps some regions of Ukraine will follow the example of Donbass - there is such an opinion on this."}, {"url": "https://alsiasi.com/%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%84-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%88%D9%88%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83/", "title": "Corona moved to Wuhan, China, via US military", "text": "Politician - A report published on the Canadian website concluded that the United States may stand without deliberately behind the emergence of the new Corona virus \"Covid-19\" in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\nAnd a former Professor at the University of Shanghai, Larry Romanov, stated in a report published by the Canadian Globalresearch, that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered last summer to close a large military biological laboratory at Fort Detrick base in Maryland, in anticipation of possible leaks.\nAfter the move, the United States last August witnessed a wave of pneumonia and similar diseases, and this was attributed to the repercussions of electronic cigarettes, but this hypothesis raised the suspicions of some experts.\nAfter that, media and activists in China reported that five of the Americans who participated in the international military games competitions hosted by Wuhan last October were infected with unspecified infection.\nChinese sources suggested that this mysterious disease was in fact \"Covid-19\", which he transferred to Wuhan, an American military, and he may have been infected by an accident not announced in Fort Detrick, and he was not diagnosed because of the absence of any concrete symptoms.\nSource: Globalresearch"}, {"url": "https://watan.news/%D9%87%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%9F", "title": "Is this world behind the spread of Corona virus?

The way China handled bacterial aggression against it through clear and strict government decisions, the successful mobilization of the Chinese people, and the remarkable discipline of government instructions demonstrate that China’s greatness is in the role model it represents and the model that differs from the Western model that tried to rule the world since World War II. As for Russia, I called it the Great due to its ability to directly influence the world and spread its influence without much effort, but rather by using the power of its opponents against them, as in martial arts.\nFor China, it has been exposed to the Coronavirus virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan since the fall of 2019, specifically after the military Olympics in that city. Chinese leaders consider that the epidemic was introduced to China by the American military delegation participating in these games. This entry might be a coincidence after the virus was engineered in a US military laboratory without taking the necessary precautions, if the Chinese leadership wanted not to assume bad faith on the part of the Americans. What reinforces the Chinese allegation is the recognition by Robert Radfred, the official of the Center for Epidemiology (CDC), that a number of infections were discovered in the United States before they spread to China. But here is another account that says that the virus was French-made (made in 2003 with its perpetual) and was transferred to a Sino-French joint laboratory that opened in 2017 in the city of Wuhan. Bats were experimented with, but one of the bats escaped from the laboratory and the epidemic occurred. However, regardless of the accounts and their accuracy, it became clear that the greatest possibility is that the virus is man-made and not made by nature, and therefore open questions about the bacterial experiments in laboratories and their feasibility and the possibility of turning them into a weapon of mass destruction.\nWhat is important here is not about the causes of the virus and the circumstances surrounding it, but how the Chinese state and Chinese society dealt with the epidemic and the implications of that interaction. The first indication is that the Chinese government dealt very seriously with the epidemic while its Western European and American counterparts dealt with lightness and by ignoring the dimensions of the epidemic, especially with regard to public health. The European and American concern in the first stage was about the economic and financial costs that you will incur as a result of the epidemic and not the health of citizens. The statements of the French President, the British Prime Minister and the American President confirm that stewardship is for money, not for man.\nThe second indication is the efforts made by the Chinese government in preparing equipment and field hospitals, such as a hospital with a thousand beds fully equipped in a period of ten days only, as it is a type of miracle and thus an example in dealing with a pandemic of this type. The quarantine measures on more than 60 million Chinese citizens and the purification and sterilization campaigns for everything in cities, roads, buildings and inside homes are evidence of seriousness in dealing with the epidemic without recklessness and arrogance. In addition, these measures were accompanied by measures to secure the necessary needs of citizens during the period of quarantine, those who are suspended from work and earning a living, which indicates the priority of human value to the Chinese authorities in the time of major adversity. The third indication is the response of the entire Chinese community to those measures issued by a government accused of authoritarianism and tyranny of public freedoms, which raises questions about the Chinese model compared to the Western model, which we will address in a later paragraph.\nNow that these measures have been taken and implemented in their entirety, China has managed to get out of the depth of the bottle, which is the high rate of injuries. It was clear from these measures that the pace had stabilized and then began to decline, up to the announcement of the Chinese President that China had triumphed over the epidemic, although some injuries were present here and there. What supports the Chinese president's claim that no new infections have been registered for several days. The 14-day deadline without registering new infections may be the actual indicator of the end of the crisis, knowing that observers believe that the complete exit from the epidemic will not take place before the end of the summer, but the return of life to normal will not be far away anymore.\nWhat must be emphasized is that China did not consider itself separate from the world, as it offered help to those who wanted to confront the epidemic, while the Western reaction, especially in the European Union and the United States, was negative and not without racism. And the decision of the American administration to punish anyone who contributes and provides aid to the Islamic Republic of Iran, which was severely affected by the epidemic of the Coronavirus, is the best proof of the administration's component and lack of humanity. How can those whom the West regards as \"less sophisticated\" than it can provide assistance to those who are \"more sophisticated\" than it? This is what confirms our position on the West that its progress and development was not because of its “values”, nor because of “enlightenment”, nor because of technological superiority, nor because of ethnic superiority as some have claimed, nor because of agricultural, industrial, and post-technological revolutions, but rather because of colonialism. It is sweat, tears, and blood of black, black and yellow skinned people that contributed to the prosperity of the West. Today, people with brown, yellow and black skin are seeing progress despite obstacles imposed by the West in their journey. China today has risen and is playing its humanitarian role in the world by presenting its experience in the face of the epidemic. The Serbian President welcomed the Chinese offer. It was exciting, as he considered the Chinese not only a friend, but his brother! On the other hand, we denounced the European Union, where European solidarity did not exist, but rather the opposite, which was opposed to resorting to outside the European Union to confront the epidemic.\nThis takes us to compare the Chinese model, which is being demonized daily in the Western media and by European Union officials, especially in the United States, in the current administration. The Chinese model considered that the human being is a value that must be respected, while in the West who claimed this, the human being turned into a commodity at the minimum level and consumed (by breaking the lam) only at the maximum level, it has no value except to the extent that it contributes to enriching the ruling elites. The neoliberal paradigm enshrines market sovereignty over the nation and the sovereignty of capital over man, while the Chinese paradigm integrates a strong central government to the point of authoritarianism and plans for the future in the interest of the nation and citizens and the market economy subject to the controls of the nation and the citizen and is keen on sovereignty first of all. Sovereignty in the West in the existing neoliberal model has become a view that has been eroded by statute of limitations, according to statements by French President Macron and a number of European Union officials, while sovereignty is still a living value in the Chinese model.\nHow can we explain the Chinese discipline and accept strict measures of protection if it were not for the sense of national dignity and for the citizen not to touch the government's concern for his safety? On the other hand, we found the positions of officials in the West regarding the epidemic in the first stage, ranging from denial and recklessness to concern only with the financial and economic repercussions, so they refrained from making difficult decisions such as stopping the economic wheel, imposing quarantine, costly disinfection and sterilization campaigns, preparing the tools of discovery and prevention, and then the treatment. The Chinese government did not spare the effort to tackle the epidemic. On the other hand, the American effort to confront the economic and financial repercussions in the markets was caused by the epidemic. The US President wants to allocate the equivalent of $ 1.2 trillion to revive the economy and ward off the unemployment rate reaching 20 percent in a presidential election year. On the other hand, the spending determined to face the epidemic in terms of health is still meager compared to what is being done economically and compared to what China has done. The motive is political, first and foremost, just as the exploitation of the epidemic was a political par excellence by accusing China of spreading the epidemic and evading the responsibility of failing to confront it.\nThe demonization of the Chinese model in the Western media indicates only hatred and envy that dominates the mind of officials. China has achieved record economic growth during the past three decades, and has lifted 250 million Chinese citizens out of poverty. Social achievements in health, education, and housing are incalculable, while we see slackness in providing these services in the West. The infrastructure constructed by the Chinese government has become the model for guiding from the express train to the highways to bridges that set records in height and length to the road linking China with other Asian countries. This growth is considered by the West a defeat for it and a threat to the continuation of its fading hegemony. The West only sheds light on political protests in Hong Kong, for example, or on the fate of Tibetan residents in western China or the fate of the Uyghurs. Nor can the West accept the co-existence of a political system led by the Communist Party with a market economy. All of the narrative of the West is based on non-co-existence, and seeing that the Chinese model refutes Western allegations and achieves successes that the West has not yet achieved. Among those successes are technological excellence in communication, the G5 war, and artificial intelligence. That artificial preponderance was the preserve of the West, as we saw China far ahead of it. The western economy, linked through China's supply chains, has become more dependent on China because of technological superiority and because of Chinese production itself. Perhaps the West, especially the United States, will have nothing but a devastating war on everyone to erase Chinese progress. The West and its political and economic systems know nothing but war on others to solve its structural problems.\nThe Corona virus crisis revealed the difference in the perception of humanity between the West and China. The deliberations of the House of Commons controlled by the Conservative Party sparked a contemplative view of the crisis (i.e. Robert Meltos (1766-1834), who considered increasing the world's population faster than increasing food resources and thus the future of humankind threatened). What took place in the House of Commons stated that there are those who consider Corona’s epidemic is a blessing that reduces the world's population. Since China is the most populous country, reducing the size of the population in China and the world may be a positive factor. This is racist par excellence where the life of a white man is more important than that of a man with different skin.\nAll this does not mean that the Chinese system is an ideal system and that there are no faults in it. But the demonization of China is not helpful, but rather malicious, because the Chinese experience is worthy of studying. The Chinese model may set an example for the countries of the world that want out of Western hegemony. Rejection of the Western model may be a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient condition. China presents a different model from the Western model in a strong central authority residing to the point of authoritarianism and tyranny, but fighting corruption. This may be a necessity, not an obstacle to the country's rise, and interacted with the market economy without falling into the pitfalls of inequality and corruption in the West.\nOn the other hand, we mentioned in a previous article that Russia is a great country because it can influence the world without making any efforts. In its decision to dump the oil market to hit the American shale oil sector, which constitutes one third of American production, Russia managed to deliver a very painful blow during the American presidential campaign period to that sector and through it to the actual source of American power, that is, controlling the financial markets. The coincidence of the Corona virus was an opportunity that Russia seized to deliver that blow, which became a double blow, both financial and health. This does not mean that Russia is immune from the Corona epidemic, but it is ready, prepared, and ready to take advantage of its partner and ally China to confront the epidemic and to face any possible folly issued by Western governments. Russia has presented China with a very valuable gift, which is obtaining quantities of oil at very low prices, which helps it resume its advanced path of growth and progress, while the western economies are witnessing a decline and contraction that may reach a large depression that it is unable to treat.\nGreat China and Greater Russia are an axis that is difficult to penetrate, at least in the foreseeable future, for several reasons, including political slack in the countries of the West, especially in the United States, including the economic decline where the world, including the West and the United States, has become in need of what China produces and the axis to which it belongs under various names such as \"Brix\" or Eurasian bloc. The United States was wrong to take the decision to resettle its production base outside its borders and in developing countries that have no restrictions on economic activity, including regulations and legislation in the environment and labor and labor rights. The reason for this error was its belief that it could dominate and dominate the world's economies because of what it considered to be the control of financial systems, the arteries of money, and the technological superiority that was their preserve.\nHowever, the world rejected that hegemony, led by China, which was able to replace the United States in supplying industrial goods to the world, and thus became in control of supply and supply chains. In technological excellence, the United States is no longer ahead of other countries, as China may have preceded it in many areas, including artificial intelligence in relation to communication. The American war on Huawei is evidence of the US inability to confront Chinese progress. In terms of controlling the arteries of money, both China and Russia are working to get rid of the hegemony of the dollar through a tight plan that begins to ease the use of the dollar to reduce the demand for it to reach a financial system parallel to the dollar and does not depend on the dollar as a unit of value or pricing. In the 1990s, at the height of the American unilateralism in controlling the world, then US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stated that the American nation is the indispensable nation, but after almost three decades, the United States becomes almost a nation that does not link with the irrelevant world. nation) if it continues its current behavior. This is the articulation that took place, the decline of the United States and the rise of the Russian-Chinese axis. And the Arab elites are called upon to fully and radically reconsider their relations with the West and to turn seriously to the East. Syria carried out this review.

Mordor Voice Column", "text": "Sweden has its own special way. It is understandable. After all, one of the most developed, progressive and free countries in the world, an example of multiculturalism and tolerance. Personal freedom for the Swedes is very holy, probably more than in other countries of the world. Unfortunately, nothing is known about this small RNA molecule in a protein coat.\nFrom the very beginning of the epidemic, Sweden decided to take a course towards developing “collective immunity”. Admittedly, there is more than one Sweden. The Netherlands and Great Britain decided to follow the same tactics, but only these two countries were enough for a short time. We can say that governments, under pressure from scientists and doctors, took up their heads in time. Collective immunity is excellent, but if you have to go to it at the cost of numerous victims and crowded hospitals, it is hardly worth it. But the Swedes decided otherwise. The experiment is still ongoing. The only thing that the authorities allowed themselves was to ask the population to be careful, wash their hands and maintain a social distance. How much this is possible in conditions when all the shops, beauty salons, bars and restaurants are open, they did not explain. Let, they say, free Swedes understand themselves.\nThe result of the experiment is already visible. Affected 10,483 people. Coronavirus 899 died. Here, the statistics are probably a little disingenuous. The fact is that many people do not die specifically from the coronavirus, but die from their old sores, which are exacerbated uncontrollably due to COVID-19. Probably, doctors write in the column “cause of death” precisely these sores, and not coronavirus. But even so, the figures for Sweden are not encouraging, especially when you consider that the country's population is only 10 with a tail of millions of people. Scientists are already sounding the alarm, demanding that the state take any urgent anti-epidemic measures, but the government does not react particularly. The experiment continues. And people continue to die. For the most part, those who are already not well with health and who are in advanced age. I hope this is not so, but it is very likely that the most progressive country has decided to sacrifice its old people, and at the same time facilitate the work of pension funds, for the sake of this \"collective immunity.\" Which, by the way, can be developed over the years.\nSweden is greatly admired by all kinds of lovers of infinite freedom, for example, libertarians. It is understandable, they interpret freedom as something personal and untouchable, and they simply don't give a damn about the rest. A kind of return to the Stone Age in a modern way. He who is stronger is right, he will survive. They are not at all embarrassed that in the world only Sweden decided to take this path. Even its Scandinavian neighbors imposed restrictions on movement and chose to suspend economic activity so as not to lose people. In the UK and the Netherlands, they grabbed their heads when the curve for diseased coronavirus crawled up. But better late than never.\nThe Russian authorities tried to introduce restrictions literally immediately, from the outbreak. At first it was done in a very mild form - everyone was simply asked to stay at home. One week. But too many took this week as an extra vacation, and the weather was surprisingly good, and whole crowds rushed to the parks and forest plantations with barbecue facilities and pickled meat. What is surprising - this was especially massive in Moscow, a city that is larger than Sweden in terms of population and is a huge transport hub. The city in which the coronavirus hit first.\nA week later, the Moscow authorities tightened the regime, but again humanly. Moreover, the incidence rates began to grow. And many did not understand this. And, in general, do not care that they do not think about themselves - they do not think about others whom they can infect and actually kill. And then there was a real nightmare for all “freedom lovers”. In Moscow, digital passes were introduced to maintain a self-isolation regime. A universal howl began about the restriction of freedoms, some of the particularly vile and deceitful even compared these passes with concentration camp numbers.\nBut why does everyone forget that before that there were two weeks and two requests to just stay at home? Was it very hard to sit at home for one, the first week? It is quite possible that the statistics would be completely different now and the regime of self-isolation would be considerably softened. No. Kebabs and vodka were more important. Just like, probably, freedom for the Swedes. And no one wants to think that it can cost someone life."}, {"url": "https://www.panorama.am/am/news/2020/02/26/%D5%86%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B6%D5%A5-%D5%86%D5%A5%D6%80%D5%BD%D5%AB%D5%BD%D5%B5%D5%A1%D5%B6/2245771", "title": "Coronavirus is an artificial virus.

More recently, more members of Congress from both parties have begun to express support for the initiative of Senator Mark Rubio, who has proposed reducing America's dependence on pharmaceutical supplies from China.\nThe fact that the United States will continue to attack China on all fronts, which, due to the epidemic, has so far had a respite, is unlikely to surprise anyone.\nThe article only expresses the opinion of the newspaper or the writer\nCorona developments globally ... a change in the list of the five most affected countries\nA ship found sank by the Nazis during World War II\nGermany .. 4 injured due to a stabbing accident near Frankfurt\nRussian security unveils a cell smuggling precious metals from Russia to Germany"}, {"url": "https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2020/03/22/the-latest-plague-so-far-is-a-brilliant-success/", "title": "The Latest Plague So Far Is a Brilliant Success", "text": "The wicked social control experiment using virus as the pretext for further enslavement is performing magnificently by implanting a sense of helplessness, dependence, and blind conformism. It should be noted that the favorable atmosphere enabling Them (whoever they are) to accomplish just that was contrived by the controlled and unscrupulous media in under a month of intense, coordinated, global brainwashing. Praise is in order, not for the obviously immoral master plan but for the technical excellence of its execution. In the subservient Balkans, local quislings have expectedly introduced a practically region-wide state of emergency, giving that ignoble set of local petty tyrants broad powers to impose controls and reorder the pattern of everyday life. Hardly noticed by anyone, the operation has closely followed the choreography set by Germany’s infamous Ermächtigungsgesetz of 1933, the immediate pretext being the only major substantive difference between them. Similar restrictions and intrusions have been enjoined in all the leading “western democracies” as well.\nThe background of the induced panic has been dealt with cogently and extensively by Prof. Igor Panarin (here and here). An indirect corroboration for Prof. Panarin’s “hypotheses” (as he modestly likes to call them) is the official redesignation of the heretofore bland sounding “COVID-19” as the “Chinese virus”, personalizing at last the malignant invisible enemy. German physician Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg has argued that corona has been known for decades to be an integral part of the viral structures attacking our bodies on an annual basis, to which the human immune system has by and large successfully adapted,\nIt seems that the enemy’s sudden onslaught was anything but unanticipated, however. Curiously, evidence has just emerged that a few months before the viral outbreak that is shaking the world, on October 18 2019, an interesting gathering was hosted in New York City by Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, Bloomberg School Of Public Health, World Economic Forum, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It was organized under the code-like name of “Event 201.” The gathering received scant media attention and the remarkable prescience of its participants was left completely and unjustly unremarked. To add another curious detail to these proceedings, one of the key players, Bill Gates, turns out to be a known champion of (a) radical population control (and here), and (b) mass vaccination. Without casting any aspersions, it just so happens that in practical terms the two issues are closely entwined. Mass vaccinations, preferably starting with the forced vaccination of very young children with substances of unknown but suspicious provenance and composition, may be but a step in the population control program, whether by directly injecting debilitating conditions and diseases or provoking sterility, which ultimately comes down to the same thing.\nIndeed, the biggest “known unknown” (as once someone famously put it) of the coronavirus affair may be precisely the nature of the vaccine which will probably be generated by the same pharmaceutical establishments which so presciently foretold the onset of the current crisis. Since the crisis was elevated to a global level, it is not beyond belief that the remedy will also be imposed globally. The reputedly high infectiousness of this sinister “Chinese virus” may be a perfect excuse for doing away with inconveniences like choice, and suchlike niceties, once it is decreed that everyone is required to submit meekly to the injection of the opaque substance billed as just-in-the-nick-of-time solution for the distressed world.\nWhich brings us to another curiosity striking the alert observer whose television set, of course, is permanently turned off or, if it is switched on. it is for nothing more prosaic than to watch cooking shows. Forget high government officials who have dropped dead in the sanctioned and embargoed Middle Eastern country which bears the brunt of the public animosity of the Western world. They deserve it, naturally, because they hate our freedoms. But one is hard put to explain, never mind justify, the virus’ apparent easy access to many high-profile Western figures, many of them conspicuous in public life or the world of entertainment. Their susceptibility guarantees the wide dissemination of the message that Covid-19 is no respecter of persons and that if it happened to them, you may be next. To mention just a few of these luminaries, testing positive so far have been the Game of Thrones actor Kristofer Hivju, Hollywood star Idris Elba, and the rightfully famous Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, not to mention sports figures such as Kevin Durant or even former NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, whose misfortune is unlikely to encounter any sympathy in Serbia. Why are these high-profile infections curious? Because these are people who do not walk the crowded streets or use public transport; typically they glide around in their limousines. How did they get infected? Or were they, perhaps, exemplarily and discreetly infected precisely in order to maintain the believers in official facts in a hysteric state and to drive home the point that the day of reckoning is indeed nigh.\nWe still can only speculate about much to do with this vicious plague. But all is not darkness, as we learn from this sermon by a wonderful American Orthodox priest, Father Josiah Trenham, “Virus chaos and Christian fearlessness.” It could not have been said better."}, {"url": "https://fibladi.com/news/%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%B4%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81-%D8%B3%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%B6%D8%AF-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7/", "title": "A famous doctor reveals the secret of immunity against corona", "text": "Elena Malysheva, the famous Russian presenter and presenter, enumerated some nutrients that can boost the body's immunity to fight the infection of the Coruna virus.

And their \"pale mystic\" in the White House\nRussia is already interfering in the US presidential election - in fact, the election has not yet begun, but some representatives of the intelligence community express confidence. Among other things, the Russians are guilty of misinformation about the coronavirus. Stuffing reached such a level that even the authors of the humorous portal The Onion spoke on the topic.\nSo, the Americans are again frightened by Russian interference in the internal affairs of their country. The New York Times reported on a briefing by US intelligence spokeswoman Shelby Pearson. At the meeting, she stated that the Russians “had already begun to intervene” in the 2020 elections. The scout believes that the goal of our country is to achieve the re-election of Donald trump to the post of president.\nFor several years, the Americans accused Moscow of interfering in their own affairs and even allegedly found the “Russian trace” in the previous elections. America is now preparing for the presidential election in 2020, but accusations have already poured.\nRepresentatives of Republicans and Democrats demanded that intelligence provide concrete evidence for this thesis. When exactly they will be shown to the public, not reported. At the same time, the sources of the publication said that Trump had demolished the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire for this briefing. True, the director is already leaving his post.\nPublicist and political scientist Armen Gasparyan ironically evaluated the statements of American sources.\n\"The sun has set, the flies are dead, we continue in the same spirit,\" he writes in the author's telegram channel.\nRepresentatives of Russia at different levels noted that they did not interfere in the affairs of sovereign states, and the United States was no exception. Advisor to the American President Robert O'Brien expressed doubt that Russia \"wants to\" intervene in the US presidential election again to help Donald Trump stay for a second term. According to him, given all of Trump’s anti-Russian actions as head of state, this would simply be illogical. But ... everything that happens is already becoming a joke.\n\"Russian Elder\" in the White House\nThe satirical publication The Onion ridiculed attempts to find \"Russian intervention\" in US politics. The playful article says that the national intelligence service was alarmed by the mysterious \"Russian mystic Volokov Molchalin\" who appeared in the White House. Officials fear that a self-proclaimed healer may affect the upcoming presidential election. In addition, he can read minds, and this is a blow to US counterintelligence.\nDirector of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire acts as a speaker in the material.\n“The most worrying thing is that Volokov is making more and more desperate attempts to change the behavior of the president,” Maguire says in the publication. “He calls on Trump to purify himself by self-flagellation, impregnates the western wing of the White House with the smell of incense or repeats occult spells until his eyes roll back and he does not plunge into a mystical trance. \"\nNaturally, everything said is not related to reality. A kind of \"Panorama\" in the English version simply shows the level of degradation of the topic of Russian intervention, striking to extremes. But, who knows, maybe American intelligence will now really try to learn something about the \"Russian elder\" in the White House.\n\"Although we don’t know what Volokov is whispering to Trump in the ear and whether he speaks a language we know, there is a consensus in the intelligence community: it is very likely that he intends to intervene in the upcoming elections,\" Maguire tells The Onion, emphasizing that it remains to be seen whether the “pale mystic” uses hypnosis to influence American society.\nAll of the above, of course, looks ridiculous. But when reading, for example, about the accusations of American representatives against Russia related to the theme of coronavirus, you understand that there is more truth to satire than humor.\nPhoto: twitter.com/TheOnion.\nIs Russia to blame for all sins by default?\nUS authorities have accused Russia of spreading fakes about an outbreak of coronavirus. This was reported by the media with reference to US officials. According to The Guardian, allegedly the Russian side, through Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts, actively disseminates conspiracy theories that the new disease is a biological weapon developed by the CIA. However, no serious evidence was provided.\n\"Russian slanderers intimidate the public, diverting attention from the efforts that doctors around the world are making to combat the disease,\" said Philip Ricoeur, US Under Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs.\nEarlier, the 360 channel reported that the Ukrainian media and trolls are trying to sow panic in Russia due to the outbreak of coronavirus. The absurdity at that time was that there was not a single case of coronavirus infection of a Russian citizen, since all registered cases occurred with the Chinese. Now the information has been updated - three cases of the disease of Russian citizens were recorded off the coast of Japan, but these patients are no longer carriers, they have no symptoms.\nReturning to the topic, we add that the following Ukrainian mass media found the distribution of fakes: Observer, Dialog, and New Time. In addition, strange panic messages from unknown users are recorded in social networks.\nAccording to the head of the National Values Protection Fund Oleksandr Malkevich, troll factories operate in Ukraine, which are tasked with destabilizing the situation in Russia. This proves the appearance in January of a number of reports about the fire in Wuhan, made according to the pattern.\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova rejected US coronavirus attacks on Moscow.

Thank God! Opinion", "text": "The American scientist John Calhoun performed several experiments on population development in the second half of the 20th century. He used mice instead of humans in his experiment. He created an absolutely perfect environment for them in his laboratory - absolute safety, an ideal environment, an unlimited supply of food and drink.\nThe mice that were placed in this \"ecosystem\" first examined everything carefully, then built their nests and began to multiply at an explosive rate. The population of mice began to reach enormous proportions compared to the original number, which was placed in a perfect environment. After the explosive phase of population growth, however, the second phase began - the mice stopped multiplying. The population has stopped growing. At this stage, mice began to appear, the only thing they cared about was their own beauty, the perfection of their own mouse \"fur\".\nAfter a period when the mice stopped reproducing and began to care only for their own appearance, for the beauty of their own fur coat, the last phase came: the extinction of the entire population! The entire mouse population became extinct, despite the fact that it still had a perfect environment.\nJohn Calhoun's experiments were used to significantly improve the understanding of human civilization and population development. Already at the time of the experiment, some scientists, as we hear in the video above, talked about the fact that human civilization has reached the peak of its population development and the last phase will follow, which will be the same as in mice - the extinction of Western civilization.\nThe experiments were continued. The task was to find out how to prevent the last phase of population decline (civilization), ie extinction. And a solution was indeed found: The population needed to be exposed to stress so that its members would be forced to work together. This ensured their continued survival.\nWhat the coronavirus did for us\nThe generation of Europeans who experienced World War II, after its end, began to build an environment of abundance and security in the territories of their states. Under these conditions, a generation of \"baby boomers\" began to come into the world. In their adulthood, these people have achieved an environment of absolute safety and absolute sufficiency almost to perfection. Their children and their grandchildren, unlike them, came into an environment totally \"cleansed\" of any need to face danger, scarcity or inconvenience, as their ancestors eliminated virtually all of society's burning problems.\nThe result is young people who have seen a lot in the streets of mostly \"democratic developed West\" for the last 15-20 years, and in the last ten years we have begun to see them in larger numbers in our country: around 20-30 years of age, single, childless, tattoos, with a \"perfect\" hairstyle, cleverly dressed with the only concern, namely to be able to go to the gym to work out after work and in the evening \"for coffee (beer, wine,…)\". Young people gossiping nonsense and spells about \"child free\" life, but longing for perfect photos of their Self that could be displayed for admiration by others on their Instagram and other social networks.\nTranslated into the language of John Calhoun's experiment: Western society entered a state of \"top deadlock\", when young members of the population stopped reproducing (\"child free\" life) and began to care only for the beauty of their own \"fur\".\nTwenty-thirty-year-old beauty-obsessed (bearded) tattooed children with iPhones in fashionable designer clothes taking care of themselves and their own unique uniqueness would expect in the future what the mouse population in John Calhoun's experiment - total extinction, regardless of a state of absolute sufficiency and a perfect environment for living (provided by the latitudes inhabited by the West).\nIn this situation of guaranteed civilization catastrophe, to which we inevitably headed together with the West - only the \"old\" beat the alarm, the young despite the care for the perfection of their \"fur\" and their image on social networks generally did nothing - the coronavirus crossed our path… And forced work with us!\nCoronavirus The West and the satellite states of the West, including the Czech Republic and Slovakia, fired at rocket speed from \"consumer lethargy\" (in the words of Petr Robejšek) and made the populations of these countries realize what is really important! In conditions of objective threat and objective lack of everything that is important for the fight against it and for victory over it, the coronavirus forced us to cooperate and realize that we are one whole, one organism. And not just a random cluster of lone satellites slapping somewhere in space.\nSummary and conclusions\nCalhoun noticed another fact while observing the mice in his experiment. Individuals who cared only for the beauty of their \"fur\" in the decadent phase of the mouse of civilization were considerably more stupid than previous generations - every \"old cadre\" who has still experienced socialist times and, unlike young educators, has something to compare with.\nMany of the \"older\" people have sounded for many years that the young generation is approaching an inevitable catastrophe with their way of life. There were also voices about the need for war to come, for young people to find out what was really important in life and to be forced to step out of the logic of their current existence, which led them into the abyss (to the extinction of the population and thus the end of civilization). . Their words were, I think rightly, called cynicism against the background of images of the two world wars on the European continent. But the war still caught up with us. Another war - a war against an invisible enemy that insidiously kills our most vulnerable - the old and the sick.\nThe West, which in the decades since the end of World War II has withered exactly the pattern of John Calhoun's experiment, is facing war. A war in which, fortunately, bombs do not fall, they do not shoot at the doorstep of our homes, a war in which we face an enemy that is real but not nearly as dangerous to us as a whole as if it were a nuclear war between the great powers that many still they spoke a few months ago.\nWe are facing a war that has already forced us to come together and cooperate (nationwide sewing and handing out veils, volunteer help with food, finding medical material by private entities, babysitting doctors,…). We face wars that make us realize what is really important in life and force us to pay attention to the most valuable and vulnerable in our society, our elders - our parents and grandparents, bearers of life experience and wisdom. To those who until a few weeks ago in the Western ultraliberal world were an obstacle \"on the fly\" to the \"promising young generation\" (understand for the elderly single childless tattooed (bearded) uneducated children with smartphones and the greatest concern for their image on social networks).\nThe West is at war - thank God - we will live! A lot of strength! Be Healthy! Wear a veil! Take care of yourself and everyone around you!

It is not in the least relevant whether the nature of the coronavirus is artificial or not, and it is not even of primary importance whether, if it were artificial, it was deliberately released by the \"world government\" or not. The epidemic has broken out, and that's a fact. Now the main question is to trace the way in which the \"world government\" has been able to react to it.\nTo clarify, \"world government\" is the set of global political and economic elites and intellectuals and the media (mediacrats) who are at their service. Such a \"world government\" certainly exists, since on a global scale there exist basic rules, strictly defined, which determine the basic parameters of politics, economics and ideology.\n- In economics, the only recognized norm is capitalism, the market economy (contested today practically only by North Korea - not, and this is very important, by China, which presents its own version of state capitalism under the leadership of the Communist Party).\n- In politics the only recognized norm is liberal parliamentary democracy, based on the fact that civil society is a subject and source of legality and legitimacy (in addition to North Korea, almost all countries share this point, even if China interprets the \"Civil society\" in a specific socialist and partly national-cultural perspective and carries out a media screening by means other than direct parliamentary elections; moreover, some Islamic States - for example, Iran and the Gulf monarchies - have a series of characteristics peculiar).\n- As far as ideology is concerned, everyone agrees with the provision according to which every individual has a series of inalienable rights (to life, freedom of conscience, freedom of movement, etc.) that all States and societies are obliged to to guarantee.\nIn essence, these are the three fundamental principles of the globalized world that emerged after the collapse of the USSR and the victory of the capitalist West in the Cold War. The main players in politics, economics and ideology are concentrated in the western countries, which serve as a model for others. This is the core of the \"world government\". Internally, China has begun to play an increasingly important role, and the elite of Russia and all other states are rapidly converging on it.\nThe artificiality of the coronavirus is not conclusive\nIt does not matter whether coronavirus was artificially produced and deliberately used by the \"world government\" in this regard.\nWhat should be noted is that this world, under the aegis of such a \"world government\" and with all three of its axiomatic foundations, is collapsing before our eyes. This recalls the end of the socialist camp, the bipolar world and the USSR; subsequently, one of the two worlds has disappeared, while the remainder has extended its rules to all the others, including its opponents yesterday. Gorbachev himself wanted to enter the \"world government\" without dissolving the USSR, but was not allowed to do so. Nor were pro-Western leaders of the Russian Federation willing to surrender to the West admitted. And they still aren't. And now, right now, that \"world government\" is collapsing. Could he have voluntarily opted for liquidation? Difficult. But it reacted to coronavirus as something inevitable, and this was a choice.\nThere was the freedom to recognize coronavirus as something existing or not. And it is with the very fact of recognizing the pandemic that the \"world government\" has signed its condemnation. Did you do it with awareness? No more (or less) than Gorbachev had with Perestroika. In the case of the USSR, one pole disappeared while the other remained intact. Today the end of planetary liberal democracy implies the end of everything. This system does not have an alternative paradigm - excluding North Korea (which is still a pure anachronism, albeit very interesting) or the Chinese compromise version.\nWho was supposed to defeat the coronavirus and how?\nThe coronavirus has already dealt a blow from which neither politics, nor the economy, nor ideology will recover. The pandemic should have been addressed by existing institutions in the normal way, without changing the basic rules:\n- neither in politics (which means no quarantine, no forced isolation, let alone a state of emergency);\n- nor in the economy (no remote work, no stoppage of production, exchanges and financial-industrial institutions or commercial platforms, no holidays, etc.);\n- nor in ideology (no restrictions, even if temporary, on essential civil rights, freedom of movement, no annulment or postponement of elections, referendums, etc.)\n... but all this has already happened on a global scale, even in western countries, that is, in the territory of the \"world government\" itself. The very foundations of the global system have been suspended.\nHere's what the current situation looks like. To take such a step, the \"world government\" must have been forced to do so. From who? After all, there can be no higher instance of authority than modern materialistic, atheist and rationalistic humanity ...\nLiberalism as a final result of the modern era\nLet's postpone the question for a second moment and now look at the broader historical trajectory accomplished by the modern liberal democratic system, that is, by the government of the \"liberal political elites\" (parliamentarianism), by the great economic actors (oligarchies and transnational monopolies), by the ideologists of \"society\" open \"and by the journalists subservient to them (including those moderators of sentiment on social networks and on the Internet). The origins of this system are to be found at the end of the Renaissance and in the \"New era\" (the first modernity) that arose, which saw a fundamental break with the Middle Ages as regards the subject of power and, consequently, for its very nature. In the Middle Ages and in the society of Tradition as a whole, the legitimacy and legality of the political model of society were based on the transcendent - superhuman, divine factor. The supreme subject of power and law was God, His revelations and the laws and ordinances established by Him, as well as those institutions considered His representatives on earth: in the Christian world, these were the Church and the monarchical state. The New Era of Modernity has abolished this vertical and has set itself the goal of building a society on earthly foundations. Thus, the main subject and source of legitimacy and legality has become man, and the \"heavenly government\" - the \"government of the supra-world\" - has given way to \"earthly government\". Politics, economics and ideology have changed accordingly: democracy, capitalism and civil society have emerged.\nFor several centuries these principles fought against the old (medieval) order until in the twentieth century even the last remaining empires - the Russian, the Ottoman, the Austrian and the German - fell. However, liberal democracy still had to cope with heretical (liberally) versions of Modernity such as communism and fascism, which in their way interpreted \"civil society\" and the human being as such: the first in class optics and the second in national or racial terms. In 1945 the communists and liberals together put an end to fascism and in 1991 the communists fell. The liberals were the only ones left, and since then the project \"world government\" has turned almost into reality, as all countries and societies have recognized the standards of democracy, the market and human rights. This is what Francis Fukuyama meant in his book The End of History and the Last Man. The history of this New era began with the aim of replacing the celestial subject with the earthly one, and ended when this replacement took place on a global scale.\nThe end of the liberal world and its parallels with the end of the USSR\nToday, instead of the end of history, that is, the total triumph of liberal democracy, global capitalism and the ideology of \"open society\" (human rights as an individual), we have fallen from one day to the next in completely conditions new. This is as unexpected as the end of the USSR. Even after 1991, many failed to realize that the Soviet system had disappeared, and some have difficulty realizing it even today. Of course, the end of globalism had been intuited by some critical thinkers: the conservatives spoke about it, and the imposing rise of China, representing a peculiar model of globalism, Putin's refusal to cede power to the manipulable and controllable (as he thought the West) Medvedev in 2012, and perhaps especially Brexit and the rise of populism, could all be clear signs that, despite its proximity to the climax, globalism has not only been unable to effectively reach the \"end of history », but is paradoxically starting to move away from it. Philosophically, postmodernists have begun to reflect on this point, loudly proclaiming the presence of something wrong with Modernity.\nBut history has no other way out: it must either go on in the wake of that inertia that it has accumulated in recent centuries, starting from the New era and the Enlightenment, or collapse. Everyone believed that somehow everything would work out on its own, and that the only thing that mattered was to deal effectively with those classified as \"enemies of open society\", namely Putin, Iran, Islamic fundamentalism, or the new rise of the nationalist movements quickly arose in response to the migration crisis. In general, nobody has thought of an alternative, not even knowingly excluding it. And that is why, in the moment of serious crisis, the global liberal system has failed and collapsed. Almost nobody has understood it yet, but it has already happened. And it happened irrevocably. The coronavirus, for its very fact and above all for the way in which it was faced by the \"world government\", marked the end of the modern world.\nThe end of \"the Unico and his property\"\nDoes this mean that humanity will perish? We don't know yet, but it can't be ruled out. At this moment we can only make assumptions about it. Instead, what can already be said with certainty is that the globalized world order based on capitalism, liberal democracy and the principles of the sovereign individual (civil society, open society) has already perished. It shattered, collapsed, although desperate efforts will still be made to save him for some time to come. How they will be deployed and how long these efforts will last is not crucial now. It cannot be excluded that the globalized world order will disappear entirely as if it were smoke, just as the Soviet system has dissolved into thin air. What was reality a moment before, the moment after is as if it never took place. It is much more important to focus on what is going to replace the old world order.\nThe most important thing to understand is that it was not a simple technical failure of the global governance system, but rather the final and consequent element of the whole historical process of Modernity, of the New era, during which power is been transferred from the celestial subject to the earthly one, and this same subject - through the ideological and political battles of the last centuries, including the hot and cold wars on a global scale - has headed towards a certain crystallization, that of parliamentary democracy, of the capitalist market global and the individual with rights. The whole system of modern global capitalism is built on the assumptions of \"the One and its property\" (Max Stirner). The political rights of the \"One\" (the individual completely divorced from the nation, race, religion, sex, etc.) have been established and rooted in the global system of political democracy. Economic rights were embodied in private property rules and market mechanisms. Thus, the source of political power has reached its immanent limit: in liberalism and globalism the last hints of verticality and \"transcendence\" which were still preserved in the early stages of Modernity, in particular in the structures of the State, were eliminated. Hence the globalist aspiration to abolish the sovereignty of the state and to transfer its powers to the supranational level, thus legalizing the \"world government\", in fact already in place. In other words, the political, economic and ideological history of the New era has moved towards a very specific goal, in which the purely human, immanent, individual subject would finally have been forged and placed at the basis of political legitimacy. Little has been left to chance: the complete abolition of states at the European Union level should have been repeated on a global scale.\nThe canceled ending of liberalism\nThis final moment, towards which everything was directed, today is not simply postponed indefinitely, but is completely thwarted. If political history prior to coronavirus had failed to reach this point, the whole process collapsed in the face of this epidemic. To effectively tackle the epidemic, authorities in almost all countries, including western countries, have introduced mandatory quarantine with severe measures in the event of a violation, or have declared a state of emergency. The economic mechanisms of the global market have collapsed due to the closure of borders, as have stock exchanges and financial institutions. Open society and unrestricted migration have come into direct contradiction with basic health standards. In fact, a dictatorial regime quickly established around the world, under which power was transferred to a completely new entity. Neither \"the One\", nor \"his property\", nor all the gigantic world superstructures which guaranteed their legal and legitimate rights and statuses are more considered the source of political power. What Giorgio Agamben called \"naked life\" came to the fore, that is, the absolutely specific imperative of physical survival which has nothing to do with the logic of liberal capitalism. Neither equality, nor rights, nor the law, nor private property, nor collective decisions, nor the system of mutual obligations, nor any other fundamental principle of liberal democracy have effective power. Now only the mechanisms that contribute to survival, to stem the infection and to satisfy primary, purely physiological needs are important.\nBut this means that the subject of power is radically changing. It is no longer free society, nor the market, nor the humanistic assumptions of the sovereign individual, nor the guarantees of personal freedom and private life. All of this is to be sacrificed if it comes to physical survival. Political rights are suppressed, economic obligations are canceled, total surveillance and strict disciplinary control become the only prevailing social norm.\nIf the \"world government\" entered a state of emergency, if it proved powerless or did not even dare to circumvent it, or was simply forced to accept it, then this means that the paradigm that until yesterday seemed unshakable has been abandoned. In this new situation, either there is no \"world government\" at all, and every society saves itself as it can, or the fundamental paradigm is changing abruptly, transforming itself into something else. In both the first and second cases, the first order has collapsed, and something new is being built before our eyes.\nSuch radical conclusions are not only related to the extent of the pandemic, which has not yet reached its maximum extent. Much more important is the perception of the epidemic by the ruling elites, who quickly and without hesitation abandoned their seemingly intangible core beliefs. This is the most important thing. Measures to combat coronavirus have already undermined the foundations of liberal democracy and capitalism, quickly abolishing the subject of power itself. Henceforth, \"the One and his property\" is no longer the basis of legality and legitimacy: in the conditions of the state of emergency, power is transferred to another authority. Something new is becoming the holder of sovereignty. But, what's it about?\nCoronavirus as the dominant subject: the lay gods of the plague\nOn the one hand, one could say that the coronavirus itself (the virus has a \"real\" name for a reason) is exhibiting its own particular status as a subject. To better understand this aspect, we can recall the ancient pestilential gods, believed to be formidable deities in the religious beliefs of the peoples of the Middle East. The peoples of Mesopotamia had Erra, Nergal and others, and in monotheistic traditions, particularly in Judaism, the plagues were sent by the supreme deity, Yahweh, to punish the Jews for their idolatry. In the Middle Ages, epidemics and pestilences were considered signs of divine punishment. Traditional society can legitimately confer the status of subject to large-scale phenomena or link them to the divine element. However, in the New Age of Modernity, man considered himself the absolute master of life - hence the development of modern medicine, drugs, vaccines, etc. Therefore, it is as if governments' complete inability to fight the coronavirus today is throwing humanity beyond the confines of the New Era. But that God, or those gods to whom the modern plague of the virus could be attributed and relegated, no longer exist. The modern world is convinced that the virus must have an earthly, material and immanent origin. But what kind of materiality is stronger than man? Hence the numerous conspiracy theories that link the origin of the virus to malefactors who aspire to establish their control over humanity. For philosophers of \"speculative realism\", who for decades have thought about the need to replace humanity with a system of objects - be it Artificial Intelligence or cyborgs - the virus itself could very well be granted sovereign actor status. , a sort of hyper-object (à la Morton) capable of subjugating the masses of beings to his will, just as mold, rhizomes, and so on. In other words, the collapse of the liberal model brings to the fore the hypothesis of the post-human, post-humanist actor.\nCoronavirus, whose Latin name literally means \"crowned poison\", is therefore (at least theoretically) a contender for the role of center of the new world system. If humanity's main concern from now on will be to fight the virus, to fight it, to protect itself from it, etc., then the whole system of values, rules and guarantees will be rebuilt according to absolutely new principles and priorities. The speculative realists go even further and are ready to recognize in the hyper-object the presence of infernal entities ascribable to the ancient gods of chaos that emerge from the depths of existence, but it is not necessary to go so far, as already only if we limit ourselves to speculating that from now on political, economic and ideological rationality will be built around the fight against contagious viruses, we get a different world - for example, a world of hygiene - organized in a completely different way from the modern world. The \"Unico\", its \"property\", and all the structures that guarantee their predictability, stability and protection, which raise them to the foundation of legality and legitimacy, will fall into the background, while the coronavirus or its analogue they will establish a different hierarchy, a new political and economic ontology, a different ideology.\nThe state against coronavirus. But which state?\nIf we observe how the fight against coronavirus is taking place today, we can see a clear and rapid expansion of the role of the state, which during the course of globalization had been considerably relegated to the background. It is at the state level that decisions are made regarding quarantine, self-isolation, travel bans, restrictions on freedoms and economic measures. In fact, everywhere in the world - openly or not - a state of emergency has been declared. According to the classics of political thought, and in particular Carl Schmitt, this means the establishment of a dictatorial regime. The ruler, according to Schmitt, is the one who decides in an emergency (Ernstfall), and today this is the state. However, it should not be forgotten that the state of today has relied, up to the last moment, on the principles of liberal democracy, capitalism and the ideology of human rights. In other words, this state today is, in a certain sense, deciding the liquidation of its philosophical and ideological foundations (even if these measures are for now formally temporary, it should not be forgotten that the Roman Empire was born precisely with the temporary dictatorship of Cesare, who gradually became permanent). Thus, the state is rapidly changing, as the virus itself is changing, following the coronavirus in this ever-changing struggle that is pushing the situation further and further away from the framework of global liberal democracy. All existing borders, which until yesterday seemed canceled or half-destroyed, are once again gaining relevance, not only for those who will cross them, but also for those who have simply managed to return to their country on time. At the same time, in larger countries, this fragmentation is affecting individual regions, where the state of emergency is leading to the establishment of their own regional dictatorships, which in turn will tend to strengthen as communication with the center takes place. harder. This fragmentation will extend to small towns and even to individual households, where forced closure will open up new horizons and lead to new levels of domestic violence.\nThe state has taken on the mission of fighting coronavirus under certain conditions, but is pursuing this struggle in already different circumstances. In the course of this mission, all state institutions related to law, legality and economics are changing. Thus, the introduction of quarantine itself completely reverses the logic of the market, according to which only the balance between supply and demand and the agreements concluded between employer and employee can regulate the relationships between the actors. The ban on working for hygienic reasons is causing the entire construction of capitalism to collapse irreparably. The suspension of freedom of movement, assembly and democratic procedures is paralyzing the institutions of political democracy and suppressing individual freedoms.\nPost-liberal dictatorship\nDuring this epidemic, a new state is emerging that is starting to work with new rules. It is very probable that in the course of the state of emergency there will be a shift of power from formal rulers to technical and technological officials, such as the military, epidemiologists and institutions created specifically for such extreme circumstances. The physical threat that the virus poses to leaders is forcing them to be placed in exceptional conditions that are not always compatible with full control of the situation. With the suspension of legal regulations, new behavioral algorithms and new practices begin to be applied. Thus was born the dictatorial state, with objectives, foundations, principles and axioms completely different from those of the liberal democratic state. In this case, the \"world government\" is dissolved, because any supranational strategy loses its meaning. Power is rapidly moving towards an ever lower level - but not towards society or towards citizens, but on the military-technological and medical-health level. A radically new rationality is gaining momentum - not the rationality of democracy, freedom, the market and individualism, but that of pure survival, for which responsibility falls on a subject that combines direct power and the possession of logistics technical, technological and medical. Such a subject, in the network society, will also rely on a total surveillance system that will exclude any kind of privacy.\nThus, if on the one hand we have the virus as the subject of transformation, on the other we have medical-military surveillance and a fundamentally different punitive dictatorship in all the parameters of the state that we knew until yesterday. There is no guarantee that this state, in its struggle against the lay \"gods of the plague\", will exactly coincide with the borders of the existing national entities. Since there will be no ideology or politics beyond the simple logic of survival, centralization itself will lose its meaning and legitimacy.\nFrom civil society to \"bare life\"\nWe take up again the \"bare life\" of Giorgio Agamben, who in a similar way and on the basis of Schmitt's ideas about the \"state of emergency\" analyzed the condition of the Nazi concentration camps, where the dehumanization of people reached the extreme , and under which the \"naked life\" manifested itself. The \"naked life\" is not human life, but some other life that goes beyond the limits of self-awareness, personality, individuality, rights and so on. This is why Agamben was more radical than the others and opposed those measures that are being taken today against coronavirus, preferring even death to the introduction of a state of emergency. He clearly understood that even the smallest step in this direction changes the whole structure of the world order. Entering the dictatorial phase is easy, but sometimes it is impossible to get out of it.\n\"Bare life\" is the victim of the virus. Not people, families, citizens or private owners. Here there is none of this. There is only the fact of infection, which can transform anyone - even himself - into something else, and therefore into the enemy of \"bare life\" itself. And it is the struggle against this other \"naked life\" that gives the dictatorship the new status of subject. Then society itself, at the mercy of the dictatorship, will be transformed into \"naked life\" organized by the dictatorship according to its own peculiar rationality. For fear of the coronavirus, people are ready to take all the steps of those who have taken responsibility for the state of emergency.\nThus, the fundamental split between the healthy and the sick, considered by Michel Foucault in his book Supervise and punish - Birth of the prison, will become even more insurmountable than all the oppositions that characterize the classical ideologies of modernity, for example between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat , the Aryans and the Jews, the liberals and the \"enemies of open society\", etc. and it will see its dividing line between the poles of \"bare life\" and \"medical technologists\" who will have in their hands all the instruments of violence, surveillance and authority. The difference between the already sick and the not yet infected, which at the beginning justified the new dictatorship, will disappear, and the dictatorship of virologists, who built a new legitimacy on the basis of this distinction, will create a completely new model.\nThe new dictatorship is neither fascist nor communist\nThis situation will seem to many to remember fascism or communism, but these parallels are entirely imaginary. Both fascism and communism represented forms of \"civil society\", albeit a totalitarian one, with declared ideologies that guaranteed civil rights - not to everyone, but to the significant and, in fact, overwhelming majority of their citizens. Liberalism, by reducing all identities to the level of the individual, paved the way and created the conditions for a particular type of post-liberal dictatorship which, unlike communism and fascism, will not need any ideology, as it will not have reason to persuade, mobilize or \"seduce\" the element of \"naked life\". \"Naked life\" is already consciously ready to surrender to dictatorship, regardless of what it promises or insists on. The structures of such a dictatorship will be built on the basis that it opposes the virus, not on the basis of specific ideas and preferences. The medical-military hygienic-sanitary dictatorship will be characterized by a post-liberal logic, for which the only operation will consist in the rational treatment of \"bare life\", whose owners will have no rights and no identity. This order will be built along the watershed between infected and healthy, and this dual code will be as powerful as it is obvious, requiring no justification or argument.\nArtificial intelligence and its enemies\nHere I add the following consideration: in the vectors of such a post-liberal antiviral dictatorship, we hardly see any properly human trait. Any humanity would do nothing but hinder the most effective management of \"bare life\", representing a restless, troubling chaos in search of survival at all costs. As a result, artificial intelligence, abstract mechanical calculation, could best address this task. In the military-medical dictatorship we see a distinct cybernetic dimension, something similar to the machine, as a mechanic. If \"bare life\" is chaos, then there must be a cold mathematical order at the other pole. And from now on its only legitimacy will not arise from the consensus of the society, stripped of everything except the survival instinct, but from the very criterion of its ability to make logical and balanced decisions without being influenced by unnecessary emotions and passions. Therefore, even if a medical-military hygienic-sanitary dictatorship will be established by men, sooner or later its main actors will be the machines.\nThere is no going back\nFrom this preliminary analysis of the near future - the future that has already begun - several conclusions can be drawn:\n1. It is impossible to return to the world order that existed recently and that seemed so familiar and natural that no one has reflected on its ephemerality. It may be that liberalism did not reach its natural climax and the establishment of a \"world government\", or that the nihilistic collapse was actually its original goal, only slightly veiled by an increasingly less convincing and increasingly \"humanist\" decor. perverse. Proponents of philosophical \"accelerationism\" speak of \"dark Illuminism\", emphasizing this gloomy and nihilistic aspect of liberalism as if it simply represented the accelerated movement of man towards the abyss of post-humanism. But in any case, rather than reaching \"world government\" and total democracy, we are entering an era of new fragmentation, of \"closed societies\" and of radical dictatorship, perhaps superior to the Nazi concentration camps and Soviet gulags.\n2. The end of globalization will not in any case mean a simple transition towards the Westphalian system, towards realism and a system of closed commercial states (Fichte). This would require a well-defined ideology, which existed in early modernity but which has been completely eradicated in late modernity, and especially in postmodernity. The demonization of anything remotely resembling \"nationalism\" or \"fascism\" has led to the total rejection of national identities, and now the severity of the biological threat and its crude physiological nature make national myths superfluous. The military-medical dictatorship needs no further means to motivate the masses, and furthermore nationalism does nothing but increase the dignity, self-awareness and civil sentiment of society by contradicting the rules of \"bare life\". For the society to come, there are only two criteria: healthy and sick. All other forms of identity, even national ones, have no meaning. What has been said for nationalism is roughly valid for communism, which is also a motivating ideology that mobilized the conscience of citizens to build a better society. All of these ideologies are archaic, meaningless, redundant and counterproductive in the fight against coronavirus. It would therefore be wrong to see a \"new fascism\" or \"new communism\" in the impending post-liberal paradigm. It will be something else.\n3. It cannot be excluded that this new phase will affect humanity's life or what will remain so much that, after going through all these trials and tribulations, humanity will be ready to accept any form of power, any ideology and whatever order that could mitigate the terror of the medical-military dictatorship of Artificial Intelligence. And then, in a cycle, a return to the design of the \"world government\" cannot be excluded, but this will still rest on completely different bases, since the society will have changed irreversibly in the period of the \"quarantine\". It will no longer be the choice of \"civil society\", but the cry of \"naked life\", which will recognize any authority capable of offering the liberation from the horror that has manifested itself. This would be the right time for what Christians call the \"Antichrist\".\nExaggeration and liquidation of leaders\nDoes such an analytical prediction represent too dramatic an exaggeration? I think it is realistic enough, even if, obviously, \"nobody knows the time\", and in any situation everything could be postponed until a later date. The epidemic could end abruptly and a vaccine could be found. But everything that has already happened in the first months of 2020 - the collapse of the world economy, all the radical measures in politics and in international relations imposed by the pandemic, the upheaval of the structures of civil society, the psychological changes and the introduction of surveillance and control technologies - it is irreversible. Even if everything stops right now, it will take so long before liberal globalization can return to its ever-delayed ending that many critical aspects of society will have already undergone profound transformations. At the same time, the very assumption of a rapid end to the pandemic does not belong to the category of analysis, but to the realm of naive fairy tales with a happy ending. Let's look the truth in the eye: the globalized liberal world collapsed before our eyes, just as the USSR and the global system of real socialism collapsed in 1991. Our conscience refuses to believe these colossal changes, and especially their irreversibility. But we have to do it. It is better to conceptualize them and understand them in advance - now, as long as things have not reached the acute phase.\nFinally, it may seem that this pandemic represents an opportunity for those political leaders who hypothetically would not scruple to take advantage of such an extreme situation to strengthen their power. But this could only work for a short period of time, because the logic of \"bare life\" and the military-military dictatorship belongs to a completely different register from that which the most authoritarian leader of the modern world system can imagine. Almost none of today's rulers will be able to hold their power so long and solidly in such extreme conditions. All of them, in one way or another, derive their legitimacy from the structures of that liberal democracy that is being dismantled before our eyes. This situation will require completely different figures, skills and characters. Yes, they are likely to begin this consolidation of power, and some have already begun to do so, but they are unlikely to last long.\nThere is something truly new that awaits us, and most likely it will be something truly terrifying.\nTranslation by Donato Mancuso"}, {"url": "https://cz.sputniknews.com/ceskarepublika/2020033011733528-stonjekova-o-eko-grete-media-si-ji-nevsimaji-brzy-nam-ze-zoufalstvi-rekne-ze-si-zmenila-pohlavi/", "title": "Stonjeková about eco-Greta: The media does not pay attention to her, she will soon tell us out of desperation that she has changed her gender", "text": "At the beginning of the interview, Luboš Veselý asked Stonjeková for comment on the information that a report about the climate activist Greta Thunbergová, who was supposed to be infected with coronavirus, flashed in the media.\n\"All this information has a simple background - coronavirus has been such a dominant topic in the last few weeks that many people who were previously used to ramp lights and being in the spotlight are suddenly terribly ill-advised to have another topic that it delays them, \"said Karolína Stonjeková.\nShe then returned to Thunberg.

The Czech Prime Minister, Andrej Babis, makes a proposal that totally contradicts the European trend, oriented towards ecology.

Gulbaat Rtskhiladze, the head of the Eurasia Institute, talks to us about these and other important issues.\nA: There are many versions of the new Koronavirus: where did it come from, which country did it come from, is it related to politics, or is it a really chaotic virus, and so on? As a political scientist, I will sort out all the topics and discuss them in this way.\nLet’s talk about the facts. The fact is that the earth was covered by the theme of Coronavirus, not the virus itself. It is true that the virus exists, but it is not a scale that can be considered an apocalypse and a disaster for the earth, but it is not a joke.\nOne side of the virus is the medical side, it remains to be seen whether the fight against it will be effective and whether the vaccine will be created quickly. There is another side - a criminal case, which is under investigation. Need to find out where and how it originated; Whether or not it really originated in Uhan; There is one more thing to find out - the virus was spread accidentally or intentionally. The virus is accompanied by political and economic processes and what effect do these processes have at the moment. There are also a lot of questions - what does the spread of the virus serve? How does the media work? Is the activity of journalists held or is it a chaotic situation?\nThere are traces that current processes serve something. The impression remains that this virus is specially designed. There is also a version that the virus originated in America. In early March, a Chinese diplomat's \"tweet\" was circulated claiming that the \"Kovid-19\" was not in the Chinese province of Wuhan, but had earlier appeared in the United States.\nMaybe the world economic crisis wants someone because there are forces in the world that are contributing to chaos.\nQ: Is it possible that this virus, if it really came from the United States, will be introduced by globalists against Trump? We know that the President of the United States and his economic and political program have many opponents.\n- If you are interested in my opinion, I will tell you that whatever Trump's enemies have to think about, in this situation the President of the United States is not weakened, on the contrary - he is stronger. The Democratic Party, which imposed Trump's impeachment just a few weeks ago, is giving the US president special rights today. So, we can say that Coronavirus will not reduce Trump.\nA: Europe and the United States have invested heavily in the fight against coronavirus. With these funds they will help different countries, but Georgia is not mentioned among them.\nA: It is true that no one is helping Georgia. Journalist Beka Kvitsiani published a letter in which he addressed the US Congressman Kinsinger, the Kinsinger who gave remarks to our government. The journalist writes: “Where are you? Why don't you come Why don't you support us? Why don't you say kind words to Georgia, a country that, sickly or well, manages to localize the virus? If you are such a fan of Georgia, why don't you ask the Congress to help Georgia, which has blocked all roads and the country's economy is stagnant? ”\nThe European Union has allocated funds to fight the virus, but Italy, a member of the European Union, has not received any real assistance. Germany has suspended exports of technology and medicines to Italy (and not just Italy) used against the virus. Can you imagine ?! Germany did not send medicine to Italy, which needed so much help.\nThe European Union, the European Commission, which has the greatest ambitions, has a nose in everything, sets regulations that prevent our products from entering the European market. As if they are taking care of their population, but where are these regulations now, why don't they act in Italy, why don't they take care of the Italian people? Right-wing politician, Eurosceptic Mateo Salvini, of whom I am not a big fan, says Italy needed help and received Sila in return. The only \"help\" that came from Europe was the collapse of the stock market. Italy has lost 68 billion euros from its savings.\nThat is the reality in Europe. They have no solidarity with each other in Europe. The impression remains that Coronavirus needs states, not people.\nItaly was assisted by China - it sent 31 tons of cargo, and a group of doctors arrived. Russia has also joined the humanitarian campaign to help Italy - all the necessary cargo has been delivered, and professional Russian doctors have arrived, who will be on the front lines in the particularly sick regions. So Italy’s friends turned out to be just China and Russia. It's a good expression: \"Friends will get into trouble.\" We already know who our friend is - a few days ago trailers arrived from Lars and the empty stalls in our country's stores were filled with products imported from Russia via Lars. Russian scientists have already deciphered the gene for the new coronavirus and have successfully completed the first phase of the vaccine test.\n- A state of emergency has been declared in Georgia. Was it necessary to go to a state of emergency if the government followed the globalists and Imetichra?\nA: It was really meticulous to declare a state of emergency, I did not like the form in which it was announced. The Prime Minister said that the restrictions that followed the emergency regime also apply to the church. It is unfortunate that someone puts himself above the church. Bidzina Ivanishvili is in charge of the current situation in Georgia, which is now hidden.\n- Belarus, among others, England and many other countries have not declared a state of emergency.\n- The state of emergency includes restrictions on everything. The Prime Minister said the state of emergency would not affect constitutional changes, elections, etc. The state of emergency in our understanding and in this particular case meant that we all went to the stores to stock up on products. I really couldn’t understand why it became necessary to declare a state of emergency. Maybe it was a political manipulation, the government is watching and waiting for what the opposition will say. Our doctors, who deserve great respect, are also under serious pressure. The mass media is also involved in this process, and not only Georgian, but the whole world media is involved in this information genius.\nAll the information about the virus is being spread all over the world live and full statistics are being spread, which creates hysteria. President of Belarus Lukashenko has spoken out against this hysteria.\nThe decision of the Georgian government to close the borders was enough to stop the virus and it was not necessary to declare a state of emergency.\nDeclaring a state of emergency will hurt almost every area of business. Transportation businesses, hotels, restaurants, sports facilities, salons, etc. will be affected. What is especially unfortunate is that the smallest business suffers the most, i.e. Ordinary, ordinary people who, in order to earn a living, have to do something every day. Stopping him for one day means he will have no money for bread on the second or third day.\nThe damage will seriously affect the state budget. Now they are going to take a loan from the IMF because Georgia, unlike Belarus, has no production. Lukashenko calls on the people to work, he has factories in the country, he has collective farms, the country has an income. We have nothing and all the spheres will be on the verge of collapse. The economy minister did not want to block travel to China, but the country had no other choice. The Minister knew how hard it would be to shut down our economy.\nI would definitely like to say what is the biggest mistake of the government. On February 24, I wrote an appeal to the government, saying that the road to Italy should be closed immediately. When the virus spread in Iran, one story broke - close the road and it was right, but Archenin was an attitude towards Italy. It is now clear that we need to ban traffic to the European Union as soon as possible. On March 5, the Minister of Health said that there was no need to close the roads, but on March 6, due to the efforts of our infectious disease specialists, traffic was banned. The virus spread in Georgia from February 24 to March 6. Such facts should not go unpunished, it is necessary to find out who was blocking the ban on travel to Italy until the chairman of the World Health Organization \"Black Man\" said to close. Even now they listen to his words and look at Europe, instead of imitating Korea, Japan, I do not mention the Russians, it is \"forbidden\".\n\"Corona\" has done one good thing - people are aggressive towards Europe-America, applauding Russia, which is helping Italy and everyone in the Eurasian space.\n- Anyway, do you think there is more information noise in this bakkanalia if the virus is really very dangerous and impossible?\n- There is an epidemic, there is a danger, but the reaction is exaggerated. It is a psychological trauma that will follow us for a long time, people will separate from each other, we will be locked up…\nTalked to\nEka Naskidashvili"}, {"url": "https://alwafd.news/%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%80%D9%8A/2840361-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%AF-%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%87%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7", "title": "Iranian Revolutionary Guards: \"Corona\" may be an American biological attack", "text": "Iranian Revolutionary Guards: \"Corona\" may be an American biological attack\nIranian Revolutionary Guards Commander Hussein Salami said Thursday that the Coruna virus may have been caused by a US biological attack targeting China.\nThe commander of the Revolutionary Guards confirmed that Iran would win against the Corona virus, pointing out that his country was \"fighting a biological war and everyone\nSalami added that if the Corona virus was an American biological attack, it would affect America itself.

This was reported to \"Izvestia\" in the international committee of the Bundestag. They noted that in difficult times, countries should help each other, and the current crisis will hurt the economy of the entire European Union. Removing restrictions from the Russian Federation could stimulate the growth of trade in the EU. It is planned to raise this issue in parliament at the next meeting in a week - however, it is not yet known whether it will be held as usual indoors or online. The Federation Council noted that such sentiments in Germany did not mean pan-European intentions, but recognized that if the coronavirus crisis continues, European countries will have to abandon Russophobic principles.\nIt is high time\nOn March 16, amid growing threats from the coronavirus, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the closure of the EU’s external borders. Only diplomats, persons holding a residence permit in one of the EU countries, as well as truck drivers (do not want a goods crisis in Brussels) and residents of border regions do not fall under the restrictions. However, in addition to external borders, intra-European borders began to be massively shut down. The border control was returned to Italy, where most of the deaths from the new virus were recorded, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Cyprus, all three Baltic countries.\nThe largest EU economy, Germany, did the same: on March 16, the country closed its borders with France, Denmark, Switzerland and Luxembourg. With Austria, border control has been operating since 2015, when a migration crisis erupted.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Lajen\nOn the morning of March 17, 7272 cases of COVID-19 infection were registered in the Federal Republic of Germany; on average, this indicator increases by a thousand per day. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s gloomy prediction that an epidemic could reach up to 70% of Germany’s population is at risk of becoming a reality. The investor confidence index in the country's economy fell to a record minus 49.5 points in March - this is the maximum drop that Germany has not known since 1991.\nAgainst this background, Germany should reconsider relations with Russia and lift unproductive sanctions against Moscow, a member of the Bundestag’s international committee, Waldemar Gerdt, told Izvestia. According to him, in difficult times, countries should help each other, the current crisis will hurt the EU economy.\n- Sanctions should have been canceled before this crisis caused by the coronavirus. However, now that the borders are closed, this topic is even more relevant, ”the politician said. - I think that this crisis will hurt the economy of not only Germany, but the entire EU. Definitely, we should stick together with our neighbors, we must restore trade with Russia, this will benefit the entire economic system and will be timely.\nWaldemar Gerdt also assured that he would raise this issue at the next meeting of the international committee of the Bundestag. It is not known whether the deputies will be able to gather in one building. So far, German parliamentarians have been transferred to remote mode. The committee’s meeting is likely to be held online via video, the politician suggested.\nThe official representative of the Left faction in the Bundestag on foreign policy issues, Alexander Noi, told Izvestia that he also supported the initiative to lift sanctions against Russia. This is especially true in the light of the current situation, the parliamentarian stressed.\n- The government should focus on resolving pressing issues. Sanctions against Russia definitely do not bring benefits, especially now, ”the politician noted.\nThe Izvestia Federation Council said: so far, the chances that the initiative that has appeared in Berlin will find a response among all EU members are small. The main stumbling block is the position of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n- Indeed, most of the German business is interested in lifting sanctions. But I'm not sure that the alternative to Germany initiative will be supported by other, systemic parties. Even if they support it, this proposal will run into Merkel’s position, which firmly links the issue of restrictions to resolving the situation in the Donbass, ”said Alexey Pushkov, chairman of the Federation Council Commission on Information Policy and Media Relations, to Izvestia.\nThe German Foreign Ministry did indeed tell Izvestia that the lifting of anti-Russian sanctions directly depends on the implementation of the Minsk agreements.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel\nAccording to the senator, another obstacle is the strong anti-Russian lobby in the EU, which is beneficial to keep measures as long as possible. At the same time, the politician noted that the initiative, even if it was really put forward by Germany alone, despite its status as a locomotive of the European economy, would not mean a pan-European “yes” to lifting sanctions from Russia. Consent is needed both from the Baltic states and from other EU members.\n“However, if coronavirus reaches exceptionally high proportions and kills the EU economy and leads to enormous not only human, but also economic losses, then Europeans will have to overcome their Russophobic position sooner or later and move away from the sanctions policy in the name of the well-being of our peoples,” said Alexey Pushkov .\nThere is enough money only for yourself\nAccording to the German political scientist Alexander Rahr, it is still premature to assess the losses of the EU economy due to the coronavirus - largely because the crisis is far from over and it is not known what it could lead to. But it is clearly clear that life in Germany has stopped, medium-sized business is standing, tourism and all related industries have also sagged, German exports are faced with border controls that are time-consuming.\n- It is obvious that the German economy does not expect anything good. One can firmly say now: there will be a recession, a slowdown in production. The question is how long it can last - until the summer or until the end of the year, the expert noted. - After the crisis of 2008, thanks to the money of Germany and France, it was possible to save Europe - Spain, Greece, Italy. But now, with the current scale of disaster, Berlin only has enough money for itself.\nIn the last quarter of last year, GDP growth in Germany froze at a critical level of 0.0%. This year, several major geopolitical crises were superimposed on one another: the EU and US trade wars, Washington and Beijing, Brexit, the refugee problem on the border of the European Union and Turkey.\nThe political scientist agreed that the lifting of anti-Russian sanctions in this light would be logical, but for this to happen, EU leaders need to understand how beneficial it is for them now to begin rapprochement with the Russian and Chinese markets. The main problem is ideological, it is difficult for them to step over the line that they themselves drew, the expert admitted. How the EU or its individual members behave will depend on the situation with coronavirus in the Russian Federation - if everything is stable, it is possible that Europeans will restore cooperation.\nIn a recent TASS interview, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted that European countries lost $ 240 billion due to sanctions, while Russia lost $ 50 billion, the United States lost $ 17 billion and Japan lost $ 27 billion. Germany’s exact losses are unknown, but according to a German publication Handelsblatt, Germany's economy has been losing over $ 667 million every month over the past six years."}, {"url": "http://web2.akherkhabaronline.com/ar/%D9%85%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA/117308/%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B3-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%A3%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%84%D8%B2%D8%B1%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B1%D8%A4%D9%88%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B3.html", "title": "A new conspiracy theory / Bill Gates behind the emergence and spread of the \"Corona\" virus to plant electronic chips in people's heads", "text": "Mix\nA new conspiracy theory / Bill Gates behind the emergence and spread of the \"Corona\" virus to grow electronic chips in people's heads\nMore\nCorona-related names given to newborns\nAgencies - Parents have begun naming their newborn babies, after the seemingly uncomfortable Corona virus, of the prospect of their children being forever linked to a deadly pandemic.

The way China handled bacterial aggression against it through clear and strict government decisions, the successful mobilization of the Chinese people, and the remarkable discipline of government instructions demonstrate that China’s greatness is in the role model it represents and the model that differs from the Western model that tried to rule the world since World War II. As for Russia, I called it the Great due to its ability to directly influence the world and spread its influence without much effort, but rather by using the power of its opponents against them, as in martial arts.\nFor China, it has been exposed to the Coronavirus virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan since the fall of 2019, specifically after the military Olympics in that city. Chinese leaders consider that the epidemic was introduced to China by the American military delegation participating in these games. This entry might be a coincidence after the virus was engineered in a US military laboratory without taking the necessary precautions, if the Chinese leadership wanted not to assume bad faith on the part of the Americans. What reinforces the Chinese allegation is the recognition by Robert Radfred, the official of the Center for Epidemiology (CDC), that a number of infections were discovered in the United States before they spread to China. But here is another account that says that the virus was French-made (made in 2003 with its perpetual) and was transferred to a Sino-French joint laboratory that opened in 2017 in the city of Wuhan. Bats were experimented with, but one of the bats escaped from the laboratory and the epidemic occurred. However, regardless of the accounts and their accuracy, it became clear that the greatest possibility is that the virus is man-made and not made by nature, and therefore open questions about the bacterial experiments in laboratories and their feasibility and the possibility of turning them into a weapon of mass destruction.\nWhat is important here is not about the causes of the virus and the circumstances surrounding it, but how the Chinese state and Chinese society dealt with the epidemic and the implications of that interaction. The first indication is that the Chinese government dealt very seriously with the epidemic while its Western European and American counterparts dealt with lightness and by ignoring the dimensions of the epidemic, especially with regard to public health. The European and American concern in the first stage was about the economic and financial costs that you will incur as a result of the epidemic and not the health of citizens. The statements of the French President, the British Prime Minister and the American President confirm that stewardship is for money, not for man.\nThe second indication is the efforts made by the Chinese government in preparing equipment and field hospitals, such as a hospital with a thousand beds fully equipped in a period of ten days only, as it is a type of miracle and thus an example in dealing with a pandemic of this type. The quarantine measures on more than 60 million Chinese citizens and the purification and sterilization campaigns for everything in cities, roads, buildings and inside homes are evidence of seriousness in dealing with the epidemic without recklessness and arrogance. In addition, these measures were accompanied by measures to secure the necessary needs of citizens during the period of quarantine, those who are suspended from work and earning a living, which indicates the priority of human value to the Chinese authorities in the time of major adversity. The third indication is the response of the entire Chinese community to those measures issued by a government accused of authoritarianism and tyranny of public freedoms, which raises questions about the Chinese model compared to the Western model, which we will address in a later paragraph.\nNow that these measures have been taken and implemented in their entirety, China has managed to get out of the depth of the bottle, which is the high rate of injuries. It was clear from these measures that the pace had stabilized and then began to decline, up to the announcement of the Chinese President that China had triumphed over the epidemic, although some injuries were present here and there. What supports the Chinese president's claim that no new infections have been registered for several days. The 14-day deadline without registering new infections may be the actual indicator of the end of the crisis, knowing that observers believe that the complete exit from the epidemic will not take place before the end of the summer, but the return of life to normal will not be far away anymore.\nWhat must be emphasized is that China did not consider itself separate from the world, as it offered help to those who wanted to confront the epidemic, while the Western reaction, especially in the European Union and the United States, was negative and not without racism. And the decision of the American administration to punish anyone who contributes and provides aid to the Islamic Republic of Iran, which was severely affected by the epidemic of the Coronavirus, is the best proof of the administration's component and lack of humanity. How can those whom the West regards as \"less sophisticated\" than it can provide assistance to those who are \"more sophisticated\" than it? This is what confirms our position on the West that its progress and development was not because of its “values”, nor because of “enlightenment”, nor because of technological superiority, nor because of ethnic superiority as some have claimed, nor because of agricultural, industrial, and post-technological revolutions, but rather because of colonialism. It is sweat, tears, and blood of black, black and yellow skinned people that contributed to the prosperity of the West. Today, people with brown, yellow and black skin are seeing progress despite obstacles imposed by the West in their journey. China today has risen and is playing its humanitarian role in the world by presenting its experience in the face of the epidemic. The Serbian President welcomed the Chinese offer. It was exciting, as he considered the Chinese not only a friend, but his brother! On the other hand, we denounced the European Union, where European solidarity did not exist, but rather the opposite, which was opposed to resorting to outside the European Union to confront the epidemic.\nThis takes us to compare the Chinese model, which is being demonized daily in the Western media and by European Union officials, especially in the United States, in the current administration. The Chinese model considered that the human being is a value that must be respected, while in the West who claimed this, the human being turned into a commodity at the minimum level and consumed (by breaking the lam) only at the maximum level, it has no value except to the extent that it contributes to enriching the ruling elites. The neoliberal paradigm enshrines market sovereignty over the nation and the sovereignty of capital over man, while the Chinese paradigm integrates a strong central government to the point of authoritarianism and plans for the future in the interest of the nation and citizens and the market economy subject to the controls of the nation and the citizen and is keen on sovereignty first of all. Sovereignty in the West in the existing neoliberal model has become a view that has been eroded by statute of limitations, according to statements by French President Macron and a number of European Union officials, while sovereignty is still a living value in the Chinese model.\nHow can we explain the Chinese discipline and accept strict measures of protection if it were not for the sense of national dignity and for the citizen not to touch the government's concern for his safety? On the other hand, we found the positions of officials in the West regarding the epidemic in the first stage, ranging from denial and recklessness to concern only with the financial and economic repercussions, so they refrained from making difficult decisions such as stopping the economic wheel, imposing quarantine, costly disinfection and sterilization campaigns, preparing the tools of discovery and prevention, and then the treatment. The Chinese government did not spare the effort to tackle the epidemic. On the other hand, the American effort to confront the economic and financial repercussions in the markets was caused by the epidemic. The US President wants to allocate the equivalent of $ 1.2 trillion to revive the economy and ward off the unemployment rate reaching 20 percent in a presidential election year. On the other hand, the spending determined to face the epidemic in terms of health is still meager compared to what is being done economically and compared to what China has done. The motive is political, first and foremost, just as the exploitation of the epidemic was a political par excellence by accusing China of spreading the epidemic and evading the responsibility of failing to confront it.\nThe demonization of the Chinese model in the Western media indicates only hatred and envy that dominates the mind of officials. China has achieved record economic growth during the past three decades, and has lifted 250 million Chinese citizens out of poverty. Social achievements in health, education, and housing are incalculable, while we see slackness in providing these services in the West. The infrastructure constructed by the Chinese government has become the model for guiding from the express train to the highways to bridges that set records in height and length to the road linking China with other Asian countries. This growth is considered by the West a defeat for it and a threat to the continuation of its fading hegemony. The West only sheds light on political protests in Hong Kong, for example, or on the fate of Tibetan residents in western China or the fate of the Uyghurs. Nor can the West accept the co-existence of a political system led by the Communist Party with a market economy. All of the narrative of the West is based on non-co-existence, and seeing that the Chinese model refutes Western allegations and achieves successes that the West has not yet achieved. Among those successes are technological excellence in communication, the G5 war, and artificial intelligence. That artificial preponderance was the preserve of the West, as we saw China far ahead of it. The western economy, linked through China's supply chains, has become more dependent on China because of technological superiority and because of Chinese production itself. Perhaps the West, especially the United States, will have nothing but a devastating war on everyone to erase Chinese progress. The West and its political and economic systems know nothing but war on others to solve its structural problems.\nThe Corona virus crisis revealed the difference in the perception of humanity between the West and China. The deliberations of the House of Commons controlled by the Conservative Party sparked a contemplative view of the crisis (i.e. Robert Meltos (1766-1834), who considered increasing the world's population faster than increasing food resources and thus the future of humankind threatened). What took place in the House of Commons stated that there are those who consider Corona’s epidemic is a blessing that reduces the world's population. Since China is the most populous country, reducing the size of the population in China and the world may be a positive factor. This is racist par excellence where the life of a white man is more important than that of a man with different skin.\nAll this does not mean that the Chinese system is an ideal system and that there are no faults in it. But the demonization of China is not helpful, but rather malicious, because the Chinese experience is worthy of studying. The Chinese model may set an example for the countries of the world that want out of Western hegemony. Rejection of the Western model may be a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient condition. China presents a different model from the Western model in a strong central authority residing to the point of authoritarianism and tyranny, but fighting corruption. This may be a necessity, not an obstacle to the country's rise, and interacted with the market economy without falling into the pitfalls of inequality and corruption in the West.\nOn the other hand, we mentioned in a previous article that Russia is a great country because it can influence the world without making any efforts. In its decision to dump the oil market to hit the American shale oil sector, which constitutes one third of American production, Russia managed to deliver a very painful blow during the American presidential campaign period to that sector and through it to the actual source of American power, that is, controlling the financial markets. The coincidence of the Corona virus was an opportunity that Russia seized to deliver that blow, which became a double blow, both financial and health. This does not mean that Russia is immune from the Corona epidemic, but it is ready, prepared, and ready to take advantage of its partner and ally China to confront the epidemic and to face any possible folly issued by Western governments. Russia has presented China with a very valuable gift, which is obtaining quantities of oil at very low prices, which helps it resume its advanced path of growth and progress, while the western economies are witnessing a decline and contraction that may reach a large depression that it is unable to treat.\nGreat China and Greater Russia are an axis that is difficult to penetrate, at least in the foreseeable future, for several reasons, including political slack in the countries of the West, especially in the United States, including the economic decline where the world, including the West and the United States, has become in need of what China produces and the axis to which it belongs under various names such as \"Brix\" or Eurasian bloc. The United States was wrong to take the decision to resettle its production base outside its borders and in developing countries that have no restrictions on economic activity, including regulations and legislation in the environment and labor and labor rights. The reason for this error was its belief that it could dominate and dominate the world's economies because of what it considered to be the control of financial systems, the arteries of money, and the technological superiority that was their preserve.\nHowever, the world rejected that hegemony, led by China, which was able to replace the United States in supplying industrial goods to the world, and thus became in control of supply and supply chains. In technological excellence, the United States is no longer ahead of other countries, as China may have preceded it in many areas, including artificial intelligence in relation to communication. The American war on Huawei is evidence of the US inability to confront Chinese progress. In terms of controlling the arteries of money, both China and Russia are working to get rid of the hegemony of the dollar through a tight plan that begins to ease the use of the dollar to reduce the demand for it to reach a financial system parallel to the dollar and does not depend on the dollar as a unit of value or pricing. In the 1990s, at the height of the American unilateralism in controlling the world, then US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stated that the American nation is the indispensable nation, but after almost three decades, the United States becomes almost a nation that does not link with the irrelevant world. nation) if it continues its current behavior. This is the articulation that took place, the decline of the United States and the rise of the Russian-Chinese axis.

Hello, Lugar Lab!", "text": "In early March, a \"tweet\" from Zhao Lijian, a Chinese diplomat and foreign minister of the People's Republic of China, spread, claiming that the COVID-19 did not appear in the Chinese province of Ukhan, but earlier in the United States.\nZhao called on the Americans to hide the information and called for transparency: “When did E. Ts. A 'zero' patient? How many people are infected? In which hospitals are they housed? ” - The Chinese diplomat addresses the Americans. \"Ensure transparency! Show the public the data! The United States is committed to resolving this situation. \" - He adds.\nLater, on March 13, Zhao published another \"tweet\" in which he referred to an article by former American spy Larry Romanov (published March 4 in the Canadian edition of Global Research, which globalists do not like because of the often published revelations). Romanov disagrees with the rumors circulated by part of the Chinese media that the virus was deliberately introduced by the US military in Ukhan, when the World Military Games were held there in October 2019, and that the US military was involved. As it turns out, 5 Americans became incapacitated in Ukhan and they needed to be hospitalized. They were ill with unknown diseases. According to Romanov, this means not a deliberate biological attack on China, but an involuntary spread of the disease.\nBut what and why did the American military get sick? Romanov has an interesting version of the article based on the facts. In particular, as early as August 2019, a sudden contagious outbreak of pneumonia was detected in the United States. U.S. doctors have linked the incident to the promotion of e-cigarettes. But, as Taiwanese doctors have discovered, the symptoms detected in Americans could in no way be caused by ordinary smoking. Shortly before the incident, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention closed a biological laboratory in Fort Detrick (recall Lugar's Lab !! It was after this closure that the \"e-cigarette epidemic\" erupted. In addition, after the closure of the Fort Detrick Laboratory, a number of diseases have been reported in the Hawaiian Islands. An unknown disease has plagued the Japanese, who have never been to China before.\nRomanov's article notes that judging by the fact that the US military already had the virus, it is clear why there is no \"zero\" patient - because several patients were ill at the same time. According to this theory, the origin of coronavirus has nothing to do with the Ukhan seafood market.\nOther facts speak in favor of this version. According to Daniel Lucy, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University, the first case of coronavirus disease was reported on December 1, 2019, and the patient had no contact with seafood (or bats). According to the doctor, the first patients appeared in November, but they could not be identified for some time. Only a few cases of infection were reported in December 2019, when doctors concluded that they were dealing with a new virus.\nThe same version is supported by Christian Andersen, a biologist at the Scripps Research Institute. According to him, the virus is not only unrelated to the market of Ukhan seafood, it did not appear at all in Ukhan and was imported to China from another country. As proof of this, according to Andersen, the fact that the genetic diversity of the virus in Iran and Italy has not been identified with Chinese specimens is useful.\nIn the summary of the article, Larry Romanov notes that the American Fort Detrick cannot be considered as a source of dissemination for Coronavirus-19, but since 2005-2012 there have been 1,059 cases of leakage of pathogens from secret laboratories in the United States (Hello, Lugar Laboratory !! See some examples here), making this option more and more real Ba.\nPictured: Fort Detrick Biolaboratory, where a coronavirus of COVID-19 may have been developed. \"We will probably use TV channels and social media\" - Mdinaradze"}, {"url": "https://svpressa.ru/world/article/255817/", "title": "The US is testing biological weapons in China, but Beijing will win", "text": "In his confident appeal to the Chinese people, President Xi Jinping called on the people to show courage and defeat the deadly epidemic, which has already claimed the lives of more than 100 people and more than 3,000 infected worldwide, the vast majority of which are in China. These numbers change rapidly as the epidemic accelerates. President Xi warned that the situation is serious, but not insurmountable.\n“As long as we have unwavering confidence, we will work together, rely on scientific methods of prevention and treatment, and pursue a clear policy, we will definitely be able to win this battle,” Xi Jinping said at a meeting of the Politburo.\nWild animals, such as bats, are thought to be the source of the 2019-nCoV deadly coronavirus, but science still cannot confirm these details.\nIn short, the Chinese government deserves to be congratulated for the effective and quick sanitary measures it has taken to avoid further contamination. At the same time, about 50 million people were quarantined, blocking potentially dangerous routes and checking travelers for possible symptoms.\nFlash time has an additional dimension of pain and suffering, as it affects people's celebrations of the joys of the New Chinese Lunar Year of family visits and togetherness, which creates obstacles to these celebrations. As a background, this also affects the retail economy.\nChinese doctors and nurses in several dozen cases of patients have already cured. Chinese scientists, in collaboration with their Russian counterparts, are accelerating their research into the development of a vaccine against the virus. Indeed, there is not a single country in the world that has ever made such progress, with such ardor, effectiveness and love for people, in isolating a potentially highly infectious and fatal disease, preventing infection of millions of people and providing them with protective and therapeutic measures, as well as creating a nationwide an impenetrable mechanism for monitoring health status.\nThere can be no clearer indication that the Chinese government is doing everything possible to improve the situation and well-being of its people. This is also reflected in the high respect and trust that the Chinese people have for their government. This is something that is not heard in the West - even close.\nRather, it is the other way round: in the West, illness means primarily business, and this (business) model of healthcare is constantly expanding, treating patients as a “market” and those who are not sick as a potential market. The medical industry is one of the most violent money making machines, second only to the military industry.\nMoreover, major Western media bought / sold and manipulative immediately blamed China. They demonize and slander China for allegedly inadequate hygiene and negligence on the part of doctors. This is yet another accusation of “yellow danger”, creating a danger to the whole world. From the West, this is a manifestation of horror and injustice.\nBesides such lies and false propaganda, let's look at the context of what is happening. In the United States alone, regular flu causes several thousand deaths every year, and this is despite carpet vaccination throughout the country, and in some states, compulsory vaccination. In the 2019/20 flu season, more than 7,000 reported deaths and unaccounted for serious influenza infections have already been reported; and this is only in the USA. We are talking about a country with a population of about 350 million people. The statistics for this flu epidemic can be expanded to a much larger dimension throughout Europe and the rest of the western world. And the order of numbers will be even more stunning.\nHowever, in China, with a population of approximately 1.4 billion people, an outbreak, when so far less than 3,000 people have been infected with the new 2019-nCoV virus, and the death toll is just over 100, the country is being poisoned non-stop for what it has become source of origin of this new disease.\nLet me make it clear: China does not need or does not want to compare itself with the West, nor does it want to measure the degree of its effectiveness in combating this disease and eliminating the consequences of this disease for the West. Not at all. This approach is not an integral part of Chinese philosophy. However, WHO immediately calls the outbreak a “potential pandemic,” thereby scaring the public with another danger coming from the east from China.\nThe Chinese government and Chinese scholars are working for people to contain the outbreak whenever possible. And they will win. Their determination, as always happens when China is faced with threats, overcomes almost all obstacles. What China has already achieved in preventing the serious spread of this disease in China and other countries is simply amazing. This is something that no other country in the world would have achieved in such a short period.\nChina does all this calmly, without boasting. This is just an endless stream of creativity in the interests of the welfare of the population and for the sake of harmony and, ultimately, for the sake of peaceful and trusting cohabitation of the people with their government. People are willing to participate in this gigantic effort to contain and treat this disease. They are willing to do this - despite the suffering of many because they cannot visit their families during this highly revered Chinese New Year, the celebration of the New Lunar Year, which could be called the western equivalent of Christmas in size and importance.\nHaving said this, it should also be noted that this case of 2019-nCoV, oddly enough, is similar to other diseases caused by coronoviruses - such as the “respiratory syndrome in the Middle East” - MERS, first discovered in Saudi Arabia (2012), and then spread to other countries of the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome” (SARS), first discovered in China in 2002 and spread all over the world, but quickly localized and not known infections s since 2004. Both are coronaviruses. There are suspicions that they were made in the laboratory, tested on animals. And the transmission of viruses to people became possible only with the help of a little man. The viruses were then mutated to make it possible to infect humans from humans. Both SARS and the new 2019-nCoV virus also have a feature that affects primarily people of the Chinese race (see also).\nWorldwide, there are over 100 CIA / Pentagon-sponsored secret and semi-known laboratories - laboratories for the manufacture and testing of agents for biological warfare. A few years ago, one such laboratory was discovered and registered in Ukraine. They worked on a virus affecting the \"Russian race.\" Since there is no single Russian race, their initial trials allegedly failed. Since the Empire never surrenders in its vicious attempts to dominate the world, we can assume that research on bioagents aimed at specific races is ongoing.\nThis Western, especially the American project (CIA, Pentagon, NATO) on the development of biochemical weapons for the destruction of people with diseases, not bullets and bombs - it is much cheaper! And - less obvious - it exists.\nYou can make your own conclusion about whether SARS and the new 2019-nCoV match this model. The timing of the virus is particularly curious. This was first reported on December 31, 2019 in Wuhan (center of China), and then expanded rapidly, so that it prevented China's most important holiday, the Lunar New Year. Of course, this might just be a coincidence.\nOne of Washington’s models of “low-efficiency military conflicts” is to destabilize China (and Russia, for that matter) by any means. For the sake of destabilization, China is constantly subjected to persecution and aggression - see Hong Kong, Taiwan, Uyghurs in Xinjiang, Tibet, tariff wars. So, why not use a contagious virus to try out a potential pandemic?\nWhat can be observed, and that even the West - to its chagrin and disappointment - had to be noted, is China’s extreme stubbornness and ability to adapt and resist. Resistance through great intelligence and ingenuity - that which saves the Chinese people. And this is without counter-aggression, without accusations and threats. This is China's way forward: a constant stream of endless creation, avoiding conflicts, avoiding domination, but striving for harmony by building bridges between people, as well as between countries and cultures. The result is the creation of understanding and well-being in a multipolar world.\nCould this be a model of behavior for all of humanity? If only the West opened its eyes and woke up.\nTranslation by Sergey Dukhanov.\nPosted by Peter Koenig - Peter Koenig is a researcher at the Center for Research on Globalization [CRG], Montreal, Canada), an economist and geopolitical analyst who previously worked at the World Bank.

He shared his position on the air of the program “Tsargrad. The main thing ”in a conversation with Yuri Pronko. Moreover, Glazyev is inclined to associate events such as the coronavirus pandemic, the fall in oil prices and generally the collapse of the currency and the shaking of the global economy. “The picture is painfully familiar,” he describes the situation, adding that in many ways it is similar to 2014.\n“The same beneficiaries are financial speculators. The same conductors are from across the ocean. And the same panic in the minds of, so to speak, our officials who do not understand what is happening. And some understand, but do as they are told from there. From the Monetary Fund, from Washington expert organizations and so on, ”said the expert on the program.\nAccording to Glazyev, if we take each chain separately from what is happening now, it will become clear the main thing - everything is man-made, starting with the coronavirus. And if you invite bioengineers, they will be able to tell how this strain is synthesized. Moreover, it is well known that only one country can do this. And it is she who has an extensive network of secret biological laboratories around the world, including in Ukraine.\n“Americans are testing viruses with might and main on our, in fact, compatriots.

It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\nIn this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans.\nResearchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than previously thought.\"\nIn contrast, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify \"potential risks\".\nSimon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on the news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: \"If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.\"\nIn October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on \"job promotion\", especially those causing serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans.\nSource: NATURE\nTitles\nagree on\nThis site uses cookies.

According to the publications Natural Research Journal, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, and Journal of Medical Virology, Wuhan's laboratory eventually became a preferred location for virologists around the world, and especially in the US, Canada, and the UK. due to its humid and hot climate that represents ideal conditions for the natural development of the most dangerous pathogens and the existence of a nature full of exotic animals and insects.\nThe Chinese pathogen QX discovered in the mid-1990s was taken as the basis for the 2019-nCoV coronavirus. As China became the preferred location for European, Canadian and American virologists due to its advances in the investigation of contagious diseases and the creation of vaccines to prevent and combat them, the WHO authorized the transfer of the 2019-nCoV patent to the laboratory. Wuhan BSL-4.\nFrom there we can deduce that not only Chinese scientists had access to this pathogen that could mutate during experiments, but also American, British and Canadian virologists. In 2018, in southern China, virologists discovered 89 new bat-derived coronaviruses, according to the American Journal of Virology (June 13, 2018) that had the same receptor as CoV-MERS.\nThe Duke University School of Virology in the USA is also involved in the 2019-nCoV coronavirus study in cooperation with Wuhan University where the epidemic of this new coronavirus began. It turns out that Duke University has a joint project with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) belonging to the Pentagon. This project is called the Duke Pandemic Prevention P3 Program. DARPA is responsible for the development of new technologies for military use including biological warfare.\nThe Wuhan University Institute of Virology has also been involved in coronavirus research together with the US Army Medical Research Institute for Diseases Infections, including the development of a vaccine for CoV-SARS over the years, since 1980. 90. This institute was considered, until its recent closure for failing to follow security procedures by its staff, a main laboratory for the biological defense Pentagon.\nThe close collaboration of one of the most sophisticated Pentagon agencies responsible for the research, development and testing of new weapons, including biological ones, with scientists from Wuhan's BSL-4 is striking. The use of these biological weapons during the war in Korea and Vietnam and its consequences are affecting these peoples to this day.\nIt should not be forgotten that DARPA, created in 1958, was a product of the Cold War which, after the dissolution of the USSR, took other forms, now making Russia the new enemy of the United States despite being a capitalist country. The Pentagon, according to Francis Boylem, has spent between 1990 and 2018, 100,000 million dollars in biological weapons, in whose study more than 13,000 North American scientists have been participating with the collaboration of thousands of their Canadian and British colleagues.\n🎥 🏥👩⚕️😷 China has opened a #Wuhan hospital, built in just 10 days.

Bulgarian investigative journalist Dilyana Gaytanjieva denounced in 2018 that \"the Pentagon is developing deadly viruses in 25 countries through the Biological Cooperation Program with a particular focus on the development of killer insects.\"\nRichard Guy Reeves of the Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary Biology (Germany) stated in the pages of the journal Science that \"DARPA is creating insects to carry viruses as a new type of biological weapon.\" The project aims to insert genetically modified viruses into three types of insects: fleas, cicadas and aleurodides. In response to information in the journal Science, DARPA Allied Insects Program Director Blake Bectine stated that the program was created \"to provide new protective capabilities to the United States.\"\nThe fact that several Pentagon virologists and colleagues from Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany were doing their studies on coronaviruses in Wuhan's BSL-4 laboratory opens up the possibility of deliberate leakage of the already manipulated 2019-nCoV by the hand of scientists, taking into account the history of the use of viruses by the United States as biological weapons or due to the negligence of Chinese virologists. Nor should we forget that, according to Alan Cantwell, for more than 40 years virologists had been trying to genetically modify coronaviruses in both military and civilian laboratories to elevate viruses to the level of biological weapons. Already in 1987, about 107 virologists were dedicating themselves to this task. (Global Research, January 25, 2020).\nDonald Trump in his Annual State of the Nation Address also emphasized that \"America's enemies are retreating, America's fortune is growing, and America's future looks bright.\"\nAlso striking is the fact that while Chinese and Russian scientists say it would take more than eight months to create the 2019-nCoV vaccine, the director of the Center for Vaccine Research and Development at NIH, Barney Graham, announced that such a vaccine already exists. and it was created based on vaccines for CoV SARS and Co MERS.

Neither the WHO nor our governments have taken the trouble to reassure us.\nAccording to latest media hype, citing and often distorting scientific opinion (CNBC)\nStatistical Models by Washington think tanks predict a scenario of devastation suggesting that “more than a million Americans could die if the nation does not take swift action to stop its spread as quickly as possible”.\nOne model from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested that between 160 million and 210 million Americans could contract the disease over as long as a year. Based on mortality data and current hospital capacity, the number of deaths under the CDC’s scenarios ranged from 200,000 to as many as 1.7 million. (The Hill, March 13, 2020)\nThe Unspoken Truth: Unprecedented Global Crisis\nThe unspoken truth is that the novel coronavirus provides a pretext to powerful financial interests and corrupt politicians to trigger the entire World into a spiral of mass unemployment, bankruptcy, extreme poverty and despair.\nThis is the true picture of what is happening. “Planet Lockdown” is an encroachment on civil liberties. Entire national economies are in jeopardy. In some countries martial law has been declared.\nThis crisis is unprecedented in World history. It is destabilizing and destroying people’s lives Worldwide. It’s a “War against Humanity”.\nWhile it is presented to World public opinion as a WHO global health emergency, what is really at stake are the mechanisms of “economic warfare” sustained by fear and intimidation, with devastating consequences.\nThe economic and social impacts far exceed those attributed to the coronavirus. Cited below are selected examples of a global process:\n- Massive job losses and layoffs in the US, with more than 10 million workers filing claims for unemployment benefits.\n- In India, a 21 days lockdown has triggered a wave of famine and despair affecting millions of homeless migrant workers all over the country. No lockdown for the homeless: “too poor to afford a meal”.\n- The impoverishment in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa is beyond description. For large sectors of the urban population, household income has literally been wiped out.\n- In Italy, the destabilization of the tourist industry has resulted in bankruptcies and rising unemployment.\n- In many countries, citizens are the object of police violence. Five people involved in protests against the lockdown were killed by police in Kenya and South Africa.\nThe WHO’s global health emergency was declared on January 30th, when there were 150 confirmed cases outside China. From the outset it was based on a big lie.\nMoreover, the timing of the WHO emergency coincided with America’s ongoing wars as well simmering financial instability on the World’s stock markets.\nThis is an exceedingly complex process which we have examined in detail in the course of the last two months. Consult our archive on coronavirus.\nTo reverse the tide, we must confront the lies. And the lies are overwhelming. A counter propaganda initiative is required.\nWhen the Lie becomes the Truth, there is No Moving Backwards.\n***\nPart II\nThe Second Part of this article will largely focus on the following issues:\n- the definition of COVID-19 and the assessment of the number of “confirmed cases”,\n- the risks to people’s health,\n- how the alleged epidemic is measured and identified.\nThe Spread of the COVID-19 Infection\nIn many countries including the US, there is no precise lab test which will identify COVID-19 as the cause of a positive infection. Meanwhile the media will not only quote unreliable statistics, it will forecast a doomsday scenario.\nLet us put the discussion on COVID-19 in context.\nWhat is a Human Coronavirus. “Coronaviruses are everywhere”. They are categorized as “the second leading cause of the common cold (after rhinoviruses)”. Since the 2003 outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), several (new) corona viruses were identified. COVID-19 is categorized as a novel or new corona virus initially named SARS-CoV-2.\nAccording to Dr. Wolfgang Wobag, pneumonia is “regularly caused or accompanied by corona viruses”. And that has been the case for many years prior to the identification of the COVID-19 in January 2020:\n[It is a] well-known fact that in every “flu wave” 7-15% of acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) are coming along with coronaviruses”\nThe COVID-19 belongs to the family of coronviruses which trigger colds and seasonal influenza. We will also address the lab tests required to estimate the data as well as the spread of the COVID-19. The WHO defines the COVID-19 as follows:\n“The most commonly reported symptoms [of COVID-19] included fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath, and most patients (80%) experienced mild illness. Approximately 14% experienced severe disease and 5% were critically ill. Early reports suggest that illness severity is associated with age (>60 years old) and co-morbid disease.” (largely basing on WHO’s assessment of COVID-19 in China)\nThe prestigious New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in an article entitled Covid-19 — Navigating the Uncharted provides the following definition:\nThe overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.“\nThese assessments confirm that COVID-19 is akin to seasonal influenza and pneumonia, categorized as contagious respiratory infections.\nIf the above definitions had made the headlines, there would have been no fear and panic.\nThe COVID-19. Tests and Data Collection\nThe H1N1 Pandemic 2009. Already Seen\nThis is not the first time that a global health emergency has been called by the WHO in close liaison with Big Pharma.\nIn 2009, the WHO launched the H1N1 Swine Flu Pandemic predicting that “as many as 2 billion people could become infected over the next two years — nearly one-third of the world population.” (World Health Organization as reported by the Western media, July 2009).\nOne month later Dr Chan stated that “Vaccine makers could produce 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots per year in the best-case scenario”,(Margaret Chan, Director-General, World Health Organization (WHO), quoted by Reuters, 21 July 2009)\nWhile creating an atmosphere of fear and insecurity, pointing to am impending global public health crisis, the WHO acknowledged that the underlying symptoms were moderate and that “most people will recover from swine flu within a week, just as they would from seasonal forms of influenza” (WHO statement, quoted in the Independent, August 22, 2009).\nAnd President Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology stated with authority and determination that “the H1N1 pandemic ‘a serious health threat; to the U.S. — not as serious as the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic but worse than the swine flu outbreak of 1976.”\nH1N1 Fake Date\nIn many regards, the H1N1 2009 pandemic reveals the problems of data collection and analysis in relation to COVID-19\nFollowing the outbreak of the H1N1 swine flu in Mexico, the data collection was at the outset scanty and incomplete, as confirmed by official statements. The Atlanta based Center for Disease Control (CDC) acknowledged that what was being collected in the US were figures of “confirmed and probable cases”. There was, however, no breakdown between “confirmed” and “probable”. In fact, only a small percentage of the reported cases were “confirmed” by a laboratory test.\nThere was no attempt to improve the process of data collection in terms of lab confirmation. In fact quite the opposite. Following the level 6 Pandemic announcement, both the WHO and the CDC decided that data collection of individual confirmed and probable cases was no longer necessary to ascertain the spread of swine flu. One month after the announcement of the level six pandemic, the WHO discontinued the collection of “confirmed cases”. It did not require member countries to send in figures pertaining to confirmed or probable cases. WHO, Briefing note, 2009)\nBased on incomplete, scanty and suppressed data, the WHO nonetheless predicted with authority that: “as many as 2 billion people could become infected over the next two years — nearly one-third of the world population.” (World Health Organization as reported by the Western media, July 2009).\nIn 2010, Dr. Margaret Chan and the WHO were the object of an investigation by the European Parliament:\n“Confirmed Cases”: The CDC Methodology\nThe CDC methodology in 2020 is broadly similar (with minor changes in terminology) to that applied to the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.\nPresumptive vs. Confirmed Cases\nAccording to the CDC the data presented for the United States “include both “confirmed” and “presumptive” positive cases of COVID-19 reported to CDC or tested at CDC since January 21, 2020″.\nThe presumptive positive data does not confirm coronavirus infection: Presumptive testing involves “chemical analysis of a sample that establishes the possibility that a substance [COVID-19] is present“ (emphasis added). But it does not confirm the COVID-19. The presumptive test must then be sent for confirmation to an accredited government health lab. (For further details see: Michel Chossudovsky, Spinning Fear and Panic Across America. Analysis of COVID-19 Data, March 20, 2020)\nHow is the COVID-19 Data Tabulated?\nThe presumptive (PC) and confirmed cases (CC) are lumped together. And the total number (PC + CC ) constitutes the basis for establishing the data for COVID-19 infection. It’s like adding apples and oranges. The total figure (PC+CC) categorized as “Total cases” is meaningless. It does not measure positive COVID-19 Infection.\nCDC Data for April 5, 2020\nBut there is another important consideration: the required CDC lab test pertaining to CC (confirmed cases) is intended to “confirm the infection”. But does it confirm that the infection was caused by COVID-19?\nThe COVID-19 is a coronvirus which is associated with the broad symptoms of seasonal influenza and pneumonia. Are the lab exams pertaining to COVID-19 (confirmed cases) in a position to establish unequivocally the prevalence of COVID-19 positive infection?\nBelow are criteria and guidelines confirmed by the CDC pertaining to “The CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel” (Read carefully):\nResults are for the identification of 2019-nCoV RNA. The 2019-nCoV RNA is generally detectable in upper and lower respiratory specimens during infection. Positive results are indicative of active infection with 2019-nCoV but do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all positive results to the appropriate public health authorities.\nNegative results do not preclude 2019-nCoV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information.\nWhat this suggests is that a positive infection could be the result of other viruses as well as other corona viruses. (i.e. related to seasonal influenza or pneumonia).\nMoreover, the second paragraph suggests that “Negative Results” of the lab test does not preclude a positive COVID-12 infection. But neither do the “combined clinical observations, etc … “.\nThese criteria and CDC guidelines are contradictory and inevitably subject to error. Since January, these “positive test results” of the RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel do not prove that COVID-19 is the cause of a positive infection for the COVID-19. (also referred to as 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV-2). (See annex below).\nWhere does the bias come in?\nVarious coronaviruses are there in the tested specimen. Does the test identify COVID-19?\nHas the COVID-19 been singled out as the source of an active infection, when the infection could be the result of other viruses and/or bacteria?\nImportant Question?\nAre the tests conducted in the US since January 2020 (pertaining to upper and lower respiratory specimens) which confirm infection from one or more causes (without proof of COVID-19) entered in the CDC data banks as “confirmed cases” of COVID-19?\nAs outlined by the CDC: “The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.”\nMoreover, the presumptive cases” referred to earlier –which do not involve the test of a respiratory specimen– are casually lumped together with “confirmed cases” which are then categorized as “Total Cases”.\nAnother fundamental question: What is being tested?\nInasmuch as COVID-19 and Influenza have similar symptoms, to what extent are the data pertaining to COVID-19 “overlapping” with those pertaining to viral seasonal influenza and pneumonia?\nThe test pertaining to active infection could be attributed either to influenza or COVID-19, or both?\nWhat is More Dangerous: Seasonal Influenza or COVID-19?\nSeasonal Influenza –which has never been the object of a lockdown– appears from the recorded data on mortality to be “more dangerous” than COVID-19?\nBased on the figures below, the recorded annual death rate pertaining to Influenza is substantially higher than that pertaining to COVID-19. (This is a rough comparison, given the fact that the recorded data pertaining to COVID-19 is not on an annual basis).\nThe latest data WHO data pertaining to COVID-19\n(Globally, all countries and territories): 40,598 deaths (recorded up until April 1, 2020).\nThe estimates of annual mortality pertaining to Influenza:\nHistorically of the order of 250 000 to 500 000 annually (globally). (WHO).\nThe most recent WHO estimates (2017):\n290 000 – 650 000 deaths globally (annual).\nANNEX\nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download\nNote: Two important texts\nText of CDC criteria For in Vitro Diagnostic Use\nIntended Use\nThe CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is a real-time RT-PCR test intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from the 2019-nCoV in upper and lower respiratory specimens (such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage, and nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate) collected from individuals who meet 2019-nCoV clinical and/or epidemiological criteria (for example, clinical signs and symptoms associated with 2019-nCoV infection, contact with a probable or confirmed 2019-nCoV case, history of travel to geographic locations where 2019-nCoV cases were detected, or other epidemiologic links for which 2019-nCoV testing may be indicated as part of a public health investigation). Testing in the United States is limited to laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. § 263a, to perform high complexity tests.\nResults are for the identification of 2019-nCoV RNA. The 2019-nCoV RNA is generally detectable in upper and lower respiratory specimens during infection. Positive results are indicative of active infection with 2019-nCoV but do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all positive results to the appropriate public health authorities.\nNegative results do not preclude 2019-nCoV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information.\nTesting with the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is intended for use by trained laboratory personnel who are proficient in performing real-time RT-PCR assays. The CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is only for use under a Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization.\nSummary and Explanation\nAn outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China was initially reported to WHO on December 31, 2019. Chinese authorities identified a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has resulted in thousands of confirmed human infections in multiple provinces throughout China and many countries including the United States. Cases of asymptomatic infection, mild illness, severe illness, and some deaths have been reported.\nThe CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is a molecular in vitro diagnostic test that aids in the detection and diagnosis 2019-nCoV and is based on widely used nucleic acid amplification technology. The product contains oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled hydrolysis probes (TaqMan®) and control material used in rRT-PCR for the in vitro qualitative detection of 2019-nCoV RNA in respiratory specimens.\nThe term “qualified laboratories” refers to laboratories in which all users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use.\nPrinciples of the Procedure\nThe oligonucleotide primers and probes for detection of 2019-nCoV were selected from regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene. The panel is designed for specific detection of the 2019-nCoV (two primer/probe sets). An additional primer/probe set to detect the human RNase P gene (RP) in control samples and clinical specimens is also included in the panel.\nRNA isolated and purified from upper and lower respiratory specimens is reverse transcribed to cDNA and subsequently amplified in the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument with SDS version 1.4 software. In the process, the probe anneals to a specific target sequence located between the forward and reverse primers. During the extension phase of the PCR cycle, the 5’ nuclease activity of Taq polymerase degrades the probe, causing the reporter dye to separate from the quencher dye, generating a fluorescent signal. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, increasing the fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence intensity is monitored at each PCR cycle by Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR System with SDS version 1.4 software.\nDetection of viral RNA not only aids in the diagnosis of illness but also provides epidemiological and surveillance information.\nThe CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is a real-time RT-PCR test intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from the 2019-nCoV in upper and lower respiratory specimens (such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage, and nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate) collected from individuals who meet 2019-nCoV clinical and/or epidemiological criteria (for example, clinical signs and symptoms associated with 2019-nCoV infection, contact with a probable or confirmed 2019-nCoV case, history of travel to geographic locations where 2019-nCoV cases were detected, or other epidemiologic links for which 2019-nCoV testing may be indicated as part of a public health investigation).

The CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is only for use under a Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization.\nSerology Test for COVID-19\nCDC is working to develop a new laboratory test to assist with efforts to determine how much of the U.S. population has been exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19.\nThe serology test will look for the presence of antibodies, which are specific proteins made in response to infections. Antibodies can be found in the blood and in other tissues of those who are tested after infection. The antibodies detected by this test indicate that a person had an immune response to SARS-CoV-2, whether symptoms developed from infection or the infection was asymptomatic. Antibody test results are important in detecting infections with few or no symptoms.\nInitial work to develop a serology test for SARS-CoV-2 is underway at CDC. In order to develop the test, CDC needs blood samples from people who had COVID-19 at least 21 days after their symptoms first started. Researchers are currently working to develop the basic parameters for the test, which will be refined as more samples become available. Once the test is developed, CDC will need additional samples to evaluate whether the test works as intended.\nDonate"}, {"url": "https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2020/04/02/ground-control-planet-lockdown-only-test/", "title": "Ground Control to Planet Lockdown: This Is Only a Test", "text": "As much as Covid-19 is a circuit breaker, a time bomb and an actual weapon of mass destruction (WMD), a fierce debate is raging worldwide on the wisdom of mass quarantine applied to entire cities, states and nations.\nThose against it argue Planet Lockdown not only is not stopping the spread of Covid-19 but also has landed the global economy into a cryogenic state – with unforeseen, dire consequences. Thus quarantine should apply essentially to the population with the greatest risk of death: the elderly.\nWith Planet Lockdown transfixed by heart-breaking reports from the Covid-19 frontline, there’s no question this is an incendiary assertion.\nIn parallel, a total corporate media takeover is implying that if the numbers do not substantially go down, Planet Lockdown – an euphemism for house arrest – remains, indefinitely.\nMichael Levitt, 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry and Stanford biophysicist, was spot on when he calculated that China would get through the worst of Covid-19 way before throngs of health experts believed, and that “What we need is to control the panic”.\nLet’s cross this over with some facts and dissident opinion, in the interest of fostering an informed debate.\nThe report Covid-19 – Navigating the Uncharted was co-authored by Dr. Anthony Fauci – the White House face of the fight –, H. Clifford Lane, and CDC director Robert R. Redfield. So it comes from the heart of the U.S. healthcare establishment.\nThe report explicitly states, “the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.”\nOn March 19, four days before Downing Street ordered the British lockdown, Covid-19 was downgraded from the status of “High Consequence Infectious Disease.”\nJohn Lee, recently retired professor of pathology and former NHS consultant pathologist, has recently argued that, “the world’s 18,944 coronavirus deaths represent 0.14 per cent of the total. These figures might shoot up but they are, right now, lower than other infectious diseases that we live with (such as flu).”\nHe recommends, “a degree of social distancing should be maintained for a while, especially for the elderly and the immune-suppressed. But when drastic measures are introduced, they should be based on clear evidence. In the case of Covid-19, the evidence is not clear.”\nThat’s essentially the same point developed by a Russian military intel analyst.\nNo less than 22 scientists – see here and here – have expanded on their doubts about the Western strategy.\nDr. Sucharit Bhakdi, Professor Emeritus of Medical Microbiology at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, has provoked immense controversy with his open letter to Chancellor Merkel, stressing the “truly unforeseeable consequences of the drastic containment measures which are currently being applied in large parts of Europe.”\nEven New York governor Andrew Cuomo admitted on the record about the error of quarantining elderly people with illnesses alongside the fit young population.\nThe absolutely key issue is how the West was caught completely unprepared for the spread of Covid-19 – even after being provided a head start of two months by China, and having the time to study different successful strategies applied across Asia.\nThere are no secrets for the success of the South Korean model.\nSouth Korea was producing test kits already in early January, and by March was testing 100,000 people a day, after establishing strict control of the whole population – to Western cries of “no protection of private life”. That was before the West embarked on Planet Lockdown mode.\nSouth Korea was all about testing early, often and safely – in tandem with quick, thorough contact tracing, isolation and surveillance.\nCovid-19 carriers are monitored with the help of video-surveillance cameras, credit card purchases, smartphone records. Add to it SMS sent to everyone when a new case is detected near them or their place of work. Those in self-isolation need an app to be constantly monitored; non-compliance means a fine to the equivalent of $2,800.\nControlled demolition in effect\nIn early March, the Chinese Journal of Infectious Diseases, hosted by the Shanghai Medical Association, pre-published an Expert Consensus on Comprehensive Treatment of Coronavirus in Shanghai. Treatment recommendations included, “large doses of vitamin C…injected intravenously at a dose of 100 to 200 mg / kg per day. The duration of continuous use is to significantly improve the oxygenation index.”\nThat’s the reason why 50 tons of Vitamin C was shipped to Hubei province in early February. It’s a stark example of a simple “mitigation” solution capable of minimizing economic catastrophe.\nIn contrast, it’s as if the brutally fast Chinese “people’s war” counterpunch against Covid-19 had caught Washington totally unprepared. Steady intel rumbles on the Chinese net point to Beijing having already studied all plausible leads towards the origin of the Sars-Cov-2 virus – vital information that will be certainly weaponized, Sun Tzu style, at the right time.\nAs it stands, the sustainability of the complex Eurasian integration project has not been substantially compromised. As the EU has provided the whole planet with a graphic demonstration of its cluelessness and helplessness, everyday the Russia-China strategic partnership gets stronger – increasingly investing in soft power and advancing a pan-Eurasia dialogue which includes, crucially, medical help.\nFacing this process, the EU’s top diplomat, Joseph Borrell, sounds indeed so helpless: “There is a global battle of narratives going on in which timing is a crucial factor. […] China has brought down local new infections to single figures – and it is now sending equipment and doctors to Europe, as others do as well. China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the U.S., it is a responsible and reliable partner. In the battle of narratives we have also seen attempts to discredit the EU (…) We must be aware there is a geo-political component including a struggle for influence through spinning and the ‘politics of generosity’. Armed with facts, we need to defend Europe against its detractors.”\nThat takes us to really explosive territory. A critique of the Planet Lockdown strategy inevitably raises serious questions pointing to a controlled demolition of the global economy. What is already in stark effect are myriad declinations of martial law, severe social media policing in Ministry of Truth mode, and the return of strict border controls.\nThese are unequivocal markings of a massive social re-engineering project, complete with inbuilt full monitoring, population control and social distancing promoted as the new normal.\nThat would be taking to the limit Secretary of State Mike “we lie, we cheat, we steal” Pompeo’s assertion, on the record, that Covid-19 is a live military exercise: “This matter is going forward — we are in a live exercise here to get this right.”\nAll hail BlackRock\nSo as we face a New Great Depression, steps leading to a Brave New World are already discernable. It goes way beyond a mere Bretton Woods 2.0, in the manner that Pam and Russ Martens superbly deconstruct the recent $2 trillion, Capitol Hill-approved stimulus to the U.S. economy.\nEssentially, the Fed will “leverage the bill’s $454 million bailout slush fund into $4.5 trillion”. And no questions are allowed on who gets the money, because the bill simply cancels the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for the Fed.\nThe privileged private contractor for the slush fund is none other than BlackRock. Here’s the extremely short version of the whole, astonishing scheme, masterfully detailed here.\nWall Street has turned the Fed into a hedge fund. The Fed is going to own at least two thirds of all U.S. Treasury bills wallowing in the market before the end of the year.\nThe U.S. Treasury will be buying every security and loan in sight while the Fed will be the banker – financing the whole scheme.\nSo essentially this is a Fed/ Treasury merger. A behemoth dispensing loads of helicopter money – with BlackRock as the undisputable winner.\nBlackRock is widely known as the biggest money manager on the planet. Their tentacles are everywhere. They own 5% of Apple, 5% of Exxon Mobil, 6% of Google, second largest shareholder of AT&T (Turner, HBO, CNN, Warner Brothers) – these are just a few examples.\nThey will buy all these securities and manage those dodgy special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) on behalf of the Treasury.\nBlackRock not only is the top investor in Goldman Sachs. Better yet: Blackrock is bigger than Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank combined. BlackRock is a serious Trump donor. Now, for all practical purposes, it will be the operating system – the Chrome, Firefox, Safari – of Fed/Treasury.\nThis represents the definitive Wall Street-ization of the Fed – with no evidence whatsoever it will lead to any improvement in the lives of the average American.\nWestern corporate media, en masse, have virtually ignored the myriad, devastating economic consequences of Planet Lockdown. Wall to wall coverage barely mentions the astonishing economic human wreckage already in effect – especially for the masses barely surviving, so far, in the informal economy.\nFor all practical purposes, the Global War on Terror (GWOT) has been replaced by the Global War on Virus (GWOV). But what is not being seriously analyzed is the Perfect Toxic Storm: a totally shattered economy; The Mother of All Financial Crashes – barely masked by the trillions in helicopter money from the Fed and the ECB; the tens of millions of unemployed engendered by the New Great Depression; the millions of small businesses that will simply disappear; a widespread, global mental health crisis. Not to mention the masses of elderly, especially in the U.S., that will be issued an unspoken “drop dead” notice.\nBeyond any rhetoric about “decoupling”, the global economy is already, de facto, split in two. On one side, we have Eurasia, Africa and swathes of Latin America – what China will be painstakingly connecting and reconnecting via the New Silk Roads. On the other side, we have North America and selected Western vassals. A puzzled Europe lies in the middle.\nA cryogenically induced global economy certainly facilitates a reboot. Trumpism is the New Exceptionalism – so that means an isolationist MAGA on steroids. In contrast, China will painstakingly reboot its market base along the New Silk Roads – Africa and Latin America included – to replace the 20% of trade/exports to be lost with the U.S.\nThe meager $1,200 checks promised to Americans are a de facto precursor of the much touted Universal Basic Income (UBI). They may become permanent as tens of millions of people will be permanently unemployed. That will facilitate the transition towards a totally automated, 24/7 economy run by AI – thus the importance of 5G.\nAnd that’s where ID2020 comes in.\nAI and ID2020\nThe European Commission is involved in a crucial but virtually unknown project, CREMA (Cloud Based Rapid Elastic Manufacturing) which aims to facilitate the widest possible implementation of AI in conjunction to the advent of a cashless One-World system.\nThe end of cash necessarily implies a One-World government capable of dispensing – and controlling – UBI; a de facto full accomplishment of Foucault’s studies on biopolitics. Anyone is liable to be erased from the system if an algorithm equals this individual with dissent.\nIt gets even sexier when absolute social control is promoted as an innocent vaccine.\nID2020 is self-described as a benign alliance of “public-private partners”. Essentially, it is an electronic ID platform based on generalized vaccination. And its starts at birth; newborns will be provided with a “portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity.”\nGAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, pledges to “protect people’s health “ and provide “immunization for all”. Top partners and sponsors, apart from the WHO, include, predictably, Big Pharma.\nAt the ID2020 Alliance summit last September in New York, it was decided that the “Rising to the Good ID Challenge” program would be launched in 2020. That was confirmed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) this past January in Davos. The digital identity will be tested with the government of Bangladesh.\nThat poses a serious question: was ID2020 timed to coincide with what a crucial sponsor, the WHO, qualified as a pandemic? Or was a pandemic absolutely crucial to justify the launch of ID2020?\nAs game-changing trial runs go, nothing of course beats Event 201, which took place less than a month after ID2020.\nThe Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with, once again, the WEF, as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, described Event 201 as “a high-level pandemic exercise”. The exercise “illustrated areas where public/private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences.”\nWith Covid-19 in effect as a pandemic, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health was forced to issue a statement basically saying they just “modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction”.\nThere’s no question “a severe pandemic, which becomes ‘Event 201’ would require reliable cooperation among several industries, national governments, and key international institutions”, as spun by the sponsors. Covid-19 is eliciting exactly this kind of “cooperation”. Whether it’s “reliable” is open to endless debate.\nThe fact is that, all over Planet Lockdown, a groundswell of public opinion is leaning towards defining the current state of affairs as a global psyop: a deliberate global meltdown – the New Great Depression – imposed on unsuspecting citizens by design.\nThe powers that be, taking their cue from the tried and tested, decades-old CIA playbook, of course are breathlessly calling it a “conspiracy theory”. Yet what vast swathes of global public opinion observe is a – dangerous – virus being used as cover for the advent of a new, digital financial system, complete with a forced vaccine cum nanochip creating a full, individual, digital identity.\nThe most plausible scenario for our immediate future reads like clusters of smart cities linked by AI, with people monitored full time and duly micro-chipped doing what they need with a unified digital currency, in an atmosphere of Bentham’s and Foucault’s Panopticum on overdrive.\nSo if this is really our future, the existing world-system has to go. This is a test, this is only a test."}, {"url": "https://news.alnaeem.tv/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%86%D9%82%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A7-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1/", "title": "Report: US military may transfer SK to Chinese Wuhan", "text": "Report: US soldiers may transfer SK to Chinese Wuhan\nA report published on the Canadian website, Thursday, concluded that the United States may unintentionally behind the emergence of the new \"Corvid-19\" virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\nAnd a former Professor at the University of Shanghai, Larry Romanov, in a report published by the Canadian Globalresearch website, and seen by \"Al-Naim News,\" that \"the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered last summer to close a large military biological laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland, in anticipation of For possible leaks. ”\nChinese sources suggested that this mysterious disease was in fact \"Covid-19\", which he transferred to Wuhan, an American military, and he may have been infected by an accident not announced in Fort Detrick, and he was not diagnosed because of the absence of any concrete symptoms.\na.

However, the fact remains that we have excellent specialists, technology, science and, above all, when emergencies such as the current one occur, we make tampons for free.

In practice, loyal and faithful to all the WHO protocols, but not to talk, we really do our best, because we believe in it, we care about our health, and we have the technical and scientific means.\nHere is the result - an economy in pieces, all of which indicate us as greasers, marginalize us, in some cases we have seen insult and humiliate us as well. Then go see - how many swabs do they do in the United States? How much does it cost to take a test? Does the state provide it? Do insurance reimbursements?\nThese are not questions from American-phobic conspiracy theorists, these are the questions that the same big American media are beginning to ask themselves - Time, New York Times, Fortune, CNN ... everyone. The first to have doubts that the figures are completely distorted and that the situation will soon get out of hand are theirs.\nA few days ago rumors circulated that a test for coronavirus in the US cost around $ 3,300. The news had gone around the web and had gone viral. In fact, they hurried to specify professional debunkers (sbufalatori) such as PolitFact, but also important newspapers such as USA Today, the information would be false because referring to the hospital misadventures occurred to a man from Miami who had returned ill from China and who had posted on social details of the story. Then relaunched by the Business Insider newspaper, the news had spread all over the world. Not so, say the less alarmist American media, that gentleman had been charged for hospital costs.\nSo in summary - a guy returns from a business trip to China with a fever, alarmed shows up in the hospital for a check, they do the test, is not positive, if he goes home, he gets a bill of $ 3,200 to pay , the insurance (thank goodness that the insurance was good) refunds him $ 1,400, and they come to explain that they snorted what? Thanks, they explain, the test in theory (I repeat in theory) would be free, but where do you go to do it if you enter the hospital as soon as you enter the hospital?\nNewspapers such as MarketWatch, from the Dow Jones group in New York, that of The Wall Steet Journal, came to understand it and published it clearly: “How much does it cost to undergo the coronavirus test? Unfortunately, the answer may depend on how good your insurance is. \" This is the title. And it speaks for itself.\nBut in short, how much does it cost to have a coronavirus test today in the United States? Read also just the presentation of the survey that led Fortune, the well-known business magazine published by the Time publishing house itself: \"The test for coronavirus should be free, but it's not always that simple\". Follow the misadventures of the poor investigative journalists who telephoned all the main confederate structures to find out that each state does as it pleases, many do not answer, others say it is free, then you set foot in the hospital and you will get a surprise when you pass by. acceptance, checkouts or how much you come home, that also depends.\nThere was also the case, of which we had told you here on Sputnik Italy, of swabs withdrawn by the Food and Drug Administration. As soon as New York State was granted permission to use home-made swabs, the next day, even there will be a case, the first cases began to register.\nAnd while Trump downplay, Pence instead offers tampons for everyone, and three confederate states (California, Washington and Florida) declare a state of emergency to ask for reimbursement of health care costs, to the average American with symptoms of dry cough, sore throat and sheets of fever, the last thing that goes through his head to do is go to the hospital or to the doctor to ask for a more thorough check-up. For more information on how much the American health system invites you to take care of your health with due zeal, I recommend, rather than the various newspapers in the language, the social posts of the same Italians who work there. Yes, many things are understood there.\nAnd while South Korea reports to the WHO 5,766 confirmed cases with 35 deaths (0,6% mortality), we declare 3,089, with 107 deaths for a mortality of almost 3 and a half percent.\nDo you understand that these numbers do not stand and depend only on the diligence of the national state health authorities?\nThe exact same virus cannot have a mortality of 0.6% on one side, 3.4% on another and 7% on another. Just as it is not possible mathematically that in this globalized world it spreads more where one tries to contain it and spreads much more slowly instead where the authorities minimize, do not give a damn or leave everything in the hands of private initiative.\nConclusion\nThe conclusion is that we have closed everything and risked our entire economy to try to contain the virus. Instead of a thank you they are humiliating us. In a year's time, we will discover that it was all in vain because the virus will go back to us reimported by those countries that don't care because they have neoliberalism instead of the public interest.\nFor more information on how absurd the numbers registered by the WHO are, I summarize below the table updated yesterday.\n| Country Cases || || || Deaths Mortality |\n| CHINA || 80,656 || 3015 || 3.74% |\n| South KOREA || 5,766 || 35 || 0.61% |\n| ITALY || 3089 || 107 || 3.46% |\n|IRAN||2.922||92||3,15%|\n| USA || 129 || 9 || 6.98% |\nYou don't need to be an expert in statistics to understand that they are numbers that don't stand up. Are you wondering what to do? Nothing, we should ask the international community to behave like an international community. Instead the reality is that here we talk a lot about globalization when it comes to capital and material interests, then when it comes to serious problems everyone goes on his own.\nWe block everything, others don't give a damn, we declare all the cases we find, others declare what they like, meanwhile, the World Health Organization publishes these absurd and meaningless numbers, in the inability to impose common rules for all. Health is a planetary common good, we realize it now, before we were too busy globalizing power and capital.\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily coincide with those of Sputnik."}, {"url": "https://elssayda.com/454890/%d8%ad%d9%85%d9%84%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d9%85%d9%88%d8%b3%d8%b9%d8%a9-%d9%84%d9%84%d8%aa%d9%81%d8%aa%d9%8a%d8%b4-%d8%b9%d9%84%d9%89-%d9%85%d8%b5%d8%a7%d9%86%d8%b9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%84%d8%ad%d9%88%d9%85-%d9%88-2/", "title": "Extensive campaigns to inspect meat and poultry factories in Menoufia", "text": "Extensive campaigns to inspect meat and poultry factories in Menoufia\n03/23 13:23\nMajor General Ibrahim Ahmed Abu Limon, Governor of Menoufia, stated that coordination with the Administrative Control Authority has been formed to form committees to pass through meat and poultry factories in the Governorate Department to determine the safety and validity of what they produce and in order to protect the health and safety of citizens.

Should we be concerned?\nThe path to mandatory vaccinations\nLast week, during an interview with The Journal podcast, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who became the face of the Trump Administration's Coronavirus Task Force, said something that should have made many people feel and Take note, especially those people whose job it is to sit down and take note, that is, the media.\nKate Linebaugh asked Fauci if it was advisable to give her grandmother, who has \"vulnerable respiratory systems,\" a hug at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, to which Fauci responded negatively before uttering anything revealing.\n\"When [the rate of coronavirus infection] drops to near zero ... there is an antibody test that will be widely distributed very soon, in the coming weeks, that will let you know whether or not you have actually been infected.\" .\nHe added: \"I imagine a situation where you take an antibody test and you are absolutely sure that you were infected and did well, so you could hug your grandmother and not worry about it.\"\nLet that comment sink in for a moment.\nIf it is considered safe for those people with positive antibodies to 'hug their grandmothers' after proving their immunity credentials, then why is it not permissible for these same people to be in their jobs, houses of worship or at least the pub of Does the corner have a happy hour look?\nTo repeat: if you have already been exposed to the coronavirus and now have natural immunity to the disease (it is estimated that more than 80% of people are exposed to the disease without knowing it), then it is no longer a risk factor for members more vulnerable of society, namely the sick and the elderly. Therefore, by practicing a severe form of 'social distancing', as many countries around the world are now demanding, the ability of the human body to acquire antibodies is denied, ultimately leading to 'collective immunity' in the General population. .\nAllowing \"herd immunity\" to occur would have prevented: 1. the virus mutating into a much more cruel beast of burden due to a lack of available hosts, 2. the long life span of the virus; Although the curve can be flattened earlier, without collective immunity, the disease can easily return, and worse the second time, and 3. a future large-scale vaccination program.\nFauci went on to say that only after the infection rate \"drops to near zero\" will antibody tests be performed to determine who has been infected and who has not. But isn't that putting the proverbial chariot before the horse? The tests should have been done initially when the outbreak touched ground. Instead, we are faced with a situation where millions of people who no longer pose a risk to themselves and others are now in a senseless blockade that threatens to destabilize the world economy with yet another Great Depression, and with death rates potentially taller than we are. witnessing with the coronavirus.\nA case to follow the flock\nWith the global coronavirus hysteria escalating, several experts have questioned the logic of entire nations defending hatches against the coronavirus. One such person is Dr. Knut M. Wittkowski, head of the Department of Epidemiology of Biostatistics at Rockefeller University.\n\"As with all respiratory diseases, we must protect the elderly and the frail,\" acknowledged Dr. Wittkowski with common sense available to anyone. He then challenged the actions being taken to protect children from the disease. \"On the other hand, children do very well with these diseases and are evolutionarily designed to be exposed to all kinds of viruses.\"\nHe argued that when people are allowed to carry out their daily lives in a community setting, the elderly could eventually, sooner rather than later, come into contact with the rest of the population in \"about four weeks\" because the virus at this point it could be \"beaten\".\n\"With all respiratory diseases, the only thing stopping the disease is» collective immunity \",\" Wittkowski emphasized.\nIn addition to questioning the shortcomings of social distancing protocols, there is also the problem of knowing how many people in the population have already been exposed to the virus compared to the number of people who have died. This is known in the medical community as the \"Measured Case Mortality Rate,\" which is simply the total number of new deaths from disease divided by the total number of patients with disease. Although it is a simple mathematical equation to perform, it has never been measured due to lack of data.\nSince no official study has been conducted to find out how many people in the population have already had the disease, it is impossible to determine the lethality of the coronavirus. Therefore, the idea of closing a wide swath of the economy for a mortality rate that we do not know could best be described as, in the words of Jay Bhattacharya, MD, PhD, who is a professor of medicine at Stanford University, as well as a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research - \"amazing.\"\n\"People connect the worst case scenario in their models, they plan to say 2-4 million deaths, newspapers collect 2-4 million deaths, politicians have to respond, and the scientific basis for that projection ... does not exist\" Bhattacharya said in an interview with the Hoover Institution.\nIn a new interview, Bill Gates authoritatively states that mass public gatherings will not come back \"at all\" until we have mass vaccination. Who made him king of the world? https://t.co/siW7bZ9yGc … pic.twitter.com/ivaCI8eAEl\n— Alternative News (@NewsAlternative) April 4, 2020\nDespite so much uncertainty regarding the actual death rate, US medical spokespersons. USA They are making incredibly irresponsible statements that only serve to instill a sense of fear throughout society. Dr. Fauci, for example, said in the course of his previous interview that \"I don't think we should shake hands anymore, to be honest.\" Meanwhile, the special envoy of the World Health Organization (WHO), David Nabarro, told the BBC that \"I am sure that some form of facial protection will become the norm.\"\nNow judging how medical experts are preventing entire nations from acquiring herd immunity, coupled with the media's refusal to consider the merits of hydroxychloroquine, this leads to what should have been the last resort: a vaccine program. , which could well result in being a forced requirement for people before they can participate in any type of public event again.\nThis was suggested by none other than the world's leading vaccine proponent, Bill Gates, who said in a recent interview that any kind of mass gathering \"might not come back at all\" without a large-scale vaccination program. Some would call it a form of blackmail, used against desperate people who would do almost anything right now to come back to life as they once knew. Those days appear far in the future. This week, the UK announced that people will have to \"live with some restrictions\" until a vaccine is developed.\nTo be clear, few people would question that vaccines have been an inherent good for civilization; They have helped eradicate some of the worst diseases that humanity has ever faced, such as smallpox and polio. But today things are not as simple as simply eradicating a pandemic. A major push is currently being made, with Bill Gates at the forefront of those efforts, to introduce a vaccine containing nanotechnology to \"tag\" and monitor those injected. As just one example, consider the work being done by ID2020, a San Francisco-based biometric company that regards Microsoft as one of its founding members. He recently announced that he was exploring \"baby identification technologies\" based on \"childhood immunization.\" In other words, tracking devices built into vaccines.\nWhile the world would appreciate a vaccine to eradicate the coronavirus, many would find it unacceptable to be forced to have a vaccine that contains any type of surveillance technology. At this point in our battle against a pandemic, which has created millions of new unemployed, the last thing people need in their lives right now is another source of concern. Let's develop a coronavirus vaccine, Mr. Gates, but keep the follow-up supplements.\nSource Video footage of a Turkish drone after being shot down by the Haftar army in Libya"}, {"url": "https://sportnewsps.com/breaking-news/344417/%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AC%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%91%D9%8E%D9%87%D9%85-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B3-%D8%A8%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%91%D9%87-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%A3%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7", "title": "Roger Stone accuses Bill Gates of being behind the origins and spread of the Corona virus.", "text": "We show you our visitors the most important and latest news in the following article:\nRoger Stone accuses Bill Gates of being behind the emergence and spread of the Corona virus, today, Wednesday, April 15, 2020 6:10 pm\nOn Monday, Roger Stone accused Bill Gates of having a hand in creating the Corona virus and the spread of the pandemic throughout the world, and a former adviser to Donald Trump noted that the American billionaire, Bill Gates, may have done this so that he could grow microchips in the heads of People have to differentiate between those who were tested for COVID-19 and had not been tested.\nHe added that Gates and other scientists use the epidemic as a way to grow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations, and according to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is linked to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain \"mandatory vaccinations.\"\nThe Washington Times reported that Gates announced earlier this month that his charitable organization would invest billions of dollars in factories that would focus on developing several vaccines.\nYou may also be interested in:\nGriffin expects Trump to exit by ending the partial government closures\nCongress passes Trump's plan, ends \"government\" shutdown"}, {"url": "https://www.geopolitica.ru/en/news/former-putins-aide-coronavirus-us-biological-weapon", "title": "Former Putin’s Aide: Coronavirus is the US biological weapon", "text": "Former Putin’s Aide: Coronavirus is the US biological weapon\nAn economist, academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences Sergey Glazyev is sure that the novel coronavirus is man-made.

Now the Ukronazis are back in force, they provoke Zelenskii on a daily basis, but the man is simply unable to react and reassert his authority.\nThird, in social and economic terms, the Ukraine is in free fall. Following years of chaos and corruption the Ukraine is now a deindustrialized country which can sell only three things: men (for menial jobs in Poland and in the EU), women (prostitution) and its “black soil” (chernozem). Once the land is sold, it will give the Ukrainian budget enough money to keep up the appearance of a state for a few more month, maybe a year or so. After that – it’s show over, curtain down, lights off and everybody go home…\nFourth, it is pretty clear who the kingmaker of the Ukraine is: Arsen Avakov, the “eternal” (by Ukrainian standards) Minister of the Interior. He not only has real firepower, he also seems to be able to turn the Ukronazi “spigot” on and off depending on his personal needs and circumstances. Unlike the bona fide nutcases, Avakov does not strike me as a Nazi at all, in fact, I would say that he is non-ideological – he is all about “pure power”. This makes him a much more desirable “partner” for the Empire than real nutcases.\nFifth, while the Minsk Agreements are still more or less on the agenda, at least officially, the Ukronazis have been vocal enough in their protests to basically completely stall any meaningful negotiations. Yes, prisoners will probably be exchanged, but beyond that I see any real progress as exceedingly unlikely. For all practical purposes, the regime in Kiev has made it very clear: there will be no negotiations with the Donbass, which simply means that there will be no negotiated solution. It’s that simple, really.\nSix, COVID19 has hit the Ukraine very, very hard. The problem is that the authorities, which fully knew that they had no means to do anything meaningful began by thumping their chests and saying that there were no cases in the Ukraine only to then suddenly decree drastic quarantine measures. And yet, the true information is seeping out: Ukrainians hospitals are full of cases, mostly un-diagnosed, and many have already died. Officially, and as of right now, there are only 14 confirmed cases in the Ukraine, and only two fatalities. But absolutely everybody knows that these numbers are totally fictional and that the real number of cases remains unknown due to a lack of testing kits, not a lack of cases. MDs in Ukrainian hospitals are sounding the alarms, but nobody is listening.\nSeventh, the situation is made even worse by the fact that there are not credible alternatives to Zelenskii. There IS an opposition in the Ukraine, the typical Ukronazis nutcases and the generally pro-Russian politicians who are categorically and absolutely unacceptable to the (much larger) Ukronazi opposition. Thus, there does not appear to be any political solution or alternative to the current regime. Right now, the two politicians who appear to be the most competent are Vadim Rabinovich and Elena Lukash. These two are very sharp and, frankly, very courageous, but they don’t have a power base powerful enough to take on the Nazis. Finally, there is Viktor Medvechuk whose main quality is also his biggest weakness: he is considered close to Putin. These are all rather smart and courageous figures, but compared to the power of an Arsen Avakov – they are just soap bubbles. Will that change in the future? Maybe, but not in the foreseeable future.\nPossible scenarios\nWhen a country enters a dramatic and deep systematic crisis, something must inevitably eventually give. Right now there are relatively few protests simply because there is no political force of personality which could inspire people to rally and struggle for change. Most Ukrainians are both absolutely exhausted and absolutely desperate. They are into the “survival mode” which history has taught them and they simply wait. Frankly, I can’t blame them. My advise to all my Ukrainian contacts has been “get out of there while you can”, but if you can’t get out, then going into a survival mode is the only option.\nRight now, the Ukronazis feel energized and they are back with a vengeance demanding that the Ukraine finally be transformed into the Banderastan they have been dreaming about for generations (except they don’t use the word “Banderastan” but prefer the expression “Banderstat”. Their strength is in their unity and firepower. Their main weakness is that most Ukrainians hate them. A most dangerous combination.\nSome observers have suggested that a coup might take place. I doubt it because I don’t see any person capable of leading such a coup. Avakov would be ideal, but he is *already* in power, he does not need a coup at all. Furthermore, if an openly Ukronazi regime replaces Zelenskii, this will only further deepen the distress of the general population.\nThe truth is both as simple as it is terrible: there is no solution for the Ukraine. None whatsoever.\nSo what could happen next?\nThe basic ingredients are pretty predictable: protests, civil unrest, violence and, eventually, a break-up of the Ukraine into several entities.\nIn theory, this could be avoided, but in order to do this, at the very least, the following basic conditions have to be met:\n- The West and Russians must work together in a major reconstruction effort to rebuild the entire country, not only the war-devastated Donbass\n- The regime in Kiev must be acceptable to all three: the West, Russia and the Ukrainian people\n- The Ukronazis need to be disarmed and, when needed, either jailed or expelled\nAs you can immediately tell, this is not happening.\nYes, some have begun thinking about this issue, see, for example, this very interesting report from the Euro-Atlantic Security Leadership Group (EASLG): https://securityconference.org/assets/02_Dokumente/03_Materialien/EASLG_Statement_Ukraine_FINAL.pdf, in particular, take a good look at the “Economic Steps” and “Political Steps” suggested in this report. The fact that a guy like Gen (Ret) Breedlove, former SACEUR and rabid Russia-hater, could sign this document is, by itself, quite amazing.\nHowever, with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic AND a brutal oil war threatening most economies of our planet, I expect the western nations to simply lose interest in the Ukraine: they will be too busy scrambling to recover from the political fallout of the SARS-CoV-2 crisis. As for Russia, there is absolutely no way that she will agree to foot the bill for the reconstruction of the Ukraine, nor will she provide the forces needed to get rid of the Ukronazis. Which means that for the foreseeable future, the Ukraine will be mostly left on its own. Russia will, of course, continue to support Novorussia (for example, SARS-CoV-2 testing kits have already arrived from Russia) while distributing Russian passports to anyone wanting one (the vast majority of the people of Novorussia).\nConclusion\nThe SARS-CoV-2/COVID19 pandemic will have huge political repercussions worldwide because in this specific case, not only will the AngloZionist propaganda machine not be able to hide the truth from the people (if anything, all sorts of fake news and crazy rumors will have more “street cred” than what the politicians tell us), but the consequences of this crisis will be felt everywhere, including at home. So Trump can go on in each of his pressers about how everything in the USA is “the best”, “the greatest” and “the mightiest”, but the truth is that the this virus will reveal not only the total inability of the private sector to save the day, it will also reveal how utterly dysfunctional the US, along most other western states really are (no, Walmart and Amazon will not save the day). No wonder the western politicians are scrambling to show how “involved” they all are – they are simply trying to cover their rear end for the inevitable “lessons learned” moment coming for all. Maybe at some point in the future will see most US Americans reconsider what they think they know about Socialism and Libertarianism, especially when it becomes clear how different the reaction to the virus was in China and Russia compared to the EU or US.\nBut what will be only embarrassing for US politicians will, barring some kind of miracle, hit the Ukraine with consequences far worse than what we have seen up until now.\nFor the time being, the Ukronazis are explaining that the Nazi salute is just perfect for this situation: not only do hands not touch, but the palm of the saluting head is facing the sun, which is hygienically good (that, and a lot of Nazis are pagans, sun worship is common amongst them).\nRight now, in what are still the early stages of the pandemic, almost nobody is paying attention (most folks in the West have yet to understand that security, any and all form of security, must always be collective to be effective). Right now, the bigger danger comes from the Ukrainians returning home from abroad. But this will soon change, and the danger will become Ukrainians leaving the Ukraine. At this point the EU countries will have to turn to the Kremlin for a common response to what promises to be a major disaster.\nDonate"}, {"url": "https://tsargrad.tv/articles/my-vse-skoro-umrem-zapadnye-lidery-prodali-svoj-narod-koronavirusu-radi-vygody_242893", "title": "We will all die soon! Western leaders sell their people to coronavirus for profit", "text": "We will all die soon! Western leaders sell their people to coronavirus for profit\nThe behavior of leading European politicians who claim that “many will lose loved ones” due to coronavirus and that up to 70% of the population of their countries can become infected with them has only one explanation: psychosis is artificially induced. Why make an elephant out of a fly?\nThe most common medical procedure of the Middle Ages, when the plague used to mow up half the population of European countries, was bloodletting. It was believed that if a person blew \"bad blood\", then it will become easier for him, and from many diseases. Sometimes such barbaric methods helped, for want of a better one. It seems that a similar situation (let's not forget that everything new is well forgotten old) has arisen in our days, but only with the global economy, which is on the verge of a global crisis, when politicians striving to write off as major \"and all their sins.\nThe true causes of the pandemic?\nThere can be only three true global causes of the “pandemic” of the “Chinese” coronavirus, which, as it turns out, is not Chinese at all, but rather American and has a man-made character.\nFirstly, the \"bad blood\" of the global economy needs to be urgently released in order to alleviate the global crisis by releasing steam from the boiler, so to speak.\nSecondly, on the contrary, try to lead a completely ripe crisis in order to cash in on it and weaken its competitors.\nThirdly, to use psychosis and those caused by coronavirus, as well as problems synchronized with it in the oil market, to mask the bankruptcy of one’s own policy in various fields in order to get oneself out of the attack due to the occurrence of “force majeure circumstances”.\nAbout the second reason - the man-made coronavirus, which, by an amazing coincidence, hit the two most sworn enemies of the United States - China and Iran, as well as Northern Italy, controlled by populist antiglobalists, where, incidentally, one of the largest American bases in Europe - Aviano, is enough . As well as the fact that the structural imbalances of the world economy that have become dangerous, the economic and financial “bubbles” in a number of countries, for example, the USA, need controlled liquidation. Especially now, so that President Donald Trump, hated by globalists, does not win the upcoming elections in the United States, because in the event of a serious crisis, all his achievements within the country will be nullified, and then he will not be able to be re-elected.\nThe squares of Venice are empty. Photo: Mirco Toniolo / Ropi / Globallookpress\nTherefore, let’s talk in more detail about two other reasons - the first and third, starting from the end.\nPranker Johnson\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson, speaking in his residence at a press conference on the theme of coronavirus, detonated an information, or rather, a disinformation bomb.\n\"I have to be honest with you, honest with the British public: many families, very many families will lose loved ones ahead of time,\" the prime minister said. The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, he called the worst public health crisis. And this despite the fact that at that time, according to official figures, there were only 456 patients in the kingdom and only a few people died for this reason. At the moment there are 10. Johnson hinted that the true number of cases is, of course, much larger. In a word, the plague returns. Johnson in every possible way pretended that he himself was at risk, as he met and shook hands with the Minister of Health Nadine Dorris, who was diagnosed with coronavirus.\nIs Iron Frau a coward?\nYou can, of course, say that Boris is a shocking politician. Maybe. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose hardness and composure saved Germany and Europe during the financial crisis of 2008, when everything hung in the balance, does not belong to this category. In her country at the moment, only five people died from the “Chinese” infection, and when Merkel broadcast, there were three of them. But she says now no less terrible things than Johnson.\nAngela Merkel panic over her fellow citizens. Photo: Michael Kappeler / Globallookpress\nSitting at a press conference next to the Minister of Health, the head of the German government announced that 70% of the German population - 58 million people could be infected with the coronavirus! This means, in a conversation with Constantinople, German political scientist Alexander Rar calculated that half a million or a million people could die. “Iron” Merkel sounded panicky: there is no cure for coronavirus, you can only try to limit its further distribution, so “you need to gain time”.\n“This is a test of our solidarity, our common sense and our concern for each other,” she emphasized, and then got down to business, indicating that she did not rule out the abolition of the “black zero” rule, which does not allow Germany to borrow and have a budget deficit. Since in this \"extraordinary situation,\" the chancellor noted, the main priority for the government is to end the epidemic.\nCzech Prime Minister Andrei Babish after this statement accused Merkel of \"creating a panic\", after which Prague tightened control on the border with Germany. The Czech economy, by the way, is one of the fastest growing in Europe, and the reader probably already understood what this remark was made for.\n“Caring for each other” also explains the cancellation of the congress of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, which is scheduled for April 25, at which the successor to the current head of the party, the person Merkel Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, should have been selected, which would significantly undercut the real power of the federal chancellor.\n\"For the CDU, the country was always in the first place, and the party in the second. The health of people in our country is a priority for us in relation to everything else,\" said Kramp-Karrenbauer in a letter to the members of the CDU.\nAnd for what really?\nWhy shocking Johnson and the \"iron\" Merkel escalate passions and sow panic? Yes, because it is dictated by political reasons. Johnson hangs the catastrophic Brexit, the costs of which he seems to want to write off to the coronavirus in advance, as well as to distract the attention of the British public. In addition to this problem (Germany will suffer greatly from Britain’s break with the EU), Merkel has a barely growing economy that is entering a crisis, plus a crisis of personal power. Coronavirus is therefore ideally suited to blame both economic and political problems on it. That's all.\nEstonia shows an example\nA striking example of this was Estonia, whose authorities announced that the \"Chinese\" coronavirus, from which no one had died there, suddenly caused an economic crisis in the country. Everything was perfect in Estonia, the coronavirus came, and that’s all - the collapse came, the Estonian economy sank. “There has not been such a sharp drop since 2008,” cries Estonian Finance Minister Martin Helme.\nAccording to him, commodity circulation fell, domestic consumption declined, problems began in the tourism sector and in the trade sector. Helme tears his own hair: \"We have never had such a bad situation as in the economy now.\"\nDo you believe that the prosperity of Estonia could end so quickly? And what a wonderful example for post-Maidan Ukraine to default!\nSteam out?\nRubbing his hands and based in Frankfurt am Main European Central Bank (ECB). According to his estimates, now the eurozone, the economy of which, even without any coronavirus, was in a state close to a coma, will show less growth than previously thought. Therefore, in order to stimulate this growth during the outbreak of coronavirus, the ECB is increasing its program of \"quantitative easing\" by as much as 120 billion euros. New long-term refinancing operations are launched, new, very cheap loans are offered for banks to stimulate the manufacturing sector, in particular, small and medium enterprises. In other words, the ECB will pay commercial banks for loans while they finance the real economy. So quarantines will one day be removed, and these programs will remain.\n“Together with the existing monetary policy incentives, these measures will support the liquidity and financing of households, enterprises and banks, and will also help maintain the uninterrupted provision of loans to the real sector of the economy,” says ECB President Christine Lagarde.\nBy the way, measures to save - at least temporarily - the financial speculation and the \"bubbles\" of the western economy, which are at a standstill, are also being taken by the US Federal Reserve System (FRS) together with the Bank of England, which announced an emergency cut in rates.\nTo summarize\nThe US ban on passenger communications with Europe for 30 days. Disneyland closes in California. The abolition of military maneuvers in Europe. Temporary closure of schools and universities, restaurants and bars, and shopping centers in a number of countries. Cancellation of flights. Ban mass events. Intervention in the work of exchanges. Quarantines in cities and entire provinces that changed the lives of tens of millions of people for a while. All this is actually not so much a concern for the health of Europeans and Americans as a \"smoke screen\" for unprecedented pumping of money (in countries printing money from the air, tens, almost hundreds of billions have been allocated for this) under the pretext of force majeure circumstances to save the one step from the collapse of the western economy. But it is also a great “excuse” for politicians, pushing into the background their stupidity and mistakes. The option of an attempt by the West, primarily the US-based \"Deep State\", the headquarters of globalism, to push and lead the global crisis ready to erupt in order to extract maximum dividends from this, however, it cannot be excluded.\nIn general, if there was no coronavirus, it should have been invented.\n“Cannot even make masks”: Mardan painted the complete impotence of Europe before the coronavirus\nDefeat Coronavirus: Greet your feet and stock up on toilet paper.\nTo see abroad and not die: Where can I get a coronavirus or knife in the back"}, {"url": "https://m.alwafd.news/%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF/%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%80%D9%8A/2905278-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%86%D9%82%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A7-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%88%D9%88%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9", "title": "Report: US military may transfer SK to Chinese Wuhan", "text": "Bahauddin Abu Apartment\nDr. Hany Sarieddine\nWajdi Zainuddin\nA report published on the Canadian website concluded that the United States may stand unintentionally behind the emergence of the new Corona virus \"Covid-19\" in the Chinese city of Wuhan, according to Russia Today.\nAnd a former Professor at the University of Shanghai, Larry Romanov, stated in a report published by the Canadian Globalresearch, that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered last summer to close a large military biological laboratory at Fort Detrick base in Maryland, in anticipation of possible leaks.\nAfter the move, the United States last August witnessed a wave of pneumonia and similar diseases, and this was attributed to the repercussions of electronic cigarettes, but this hypothesis raised the suspicions of some experts.\nAfter that, media and activists in China reported that five of the Americans who participated in the international military games competitions hosted by Wuhan last October were infected with unspecified infection.\nChinese sources suggested that this mysterious disease was in fact \"Covid-19\", which he transferred to Wuhan, an American military, and he may have been infected by an accident that was not announced in Fort Detrick, and he was not diagnosed because of the absence of any concrete symptoms."}, {"url": "http://pravosudija.net/article/koronavirus-v-kitae-28-milliona-inficirovannyh-112-tysyach-pogibshih", "title": "Coronavirus in China: 2.8 million infected, 112 thousand dead", "text": "Coronavirus in China: 2.8 million infected, 112 thousand dead\nhalturnerradioshow.com:: The outbreak of the alleged new coronavirus in China is completely out of control and kills THOUSANDS every day.\nAt 6:00 p.m. EST on January 23, intelligence sources in China confirm that today there are more than 2.8 MILLION infected.

It is possible that all messages are true, it is possible that some of them are false, but this is not the main thing. The main thing is the answer to the question: why are we putting all this out?\nWe explain. We are not laying it out in order to scare someone, to prove something to someone, to collect a million visitors and so on. We simply demonstrate how the Chinese authorities are fighting the epidemic. Therefore, from these videos it should be clear how officials in other states will fight the epidemic that is spreading. This is a SCENARIO.\nAt the same time, we want to emphasize right away that China is a command and administrative country where an official who incorrectly executes a command after a short trial will receive a bag on his head and a bullet in the back of his head. This approach, of course, is very bad and tough, but in critical situations it helps well and China, by and large, is fighting the epidemic correctly.\nAnd there are resources there, from human to material, which can not be said about the countries of the glorious CIS, where officials who have left the Leninist Komsomol are well aware in offshore and kickbacks, but have little idea of the process of eliminating natural and other disasters. Therefore, if the coronavirus spills out of China and begins to spread around the world en masse, then it will be frightening for us to imagine. It is possible that some countries will have to turn to China for help to send troops.\nAnd now we turn to real conspiracy theories.

The new commander of Iran's IDPs, Jods Special Forces, Brigadier General Esmoil Kaani, recently paid a special mission to the Syrian city of Aleppo and the province of the same name. In an interview with Mehr News, Omar Rahmon, a member of the Syrian National Reconciliation Commission, said that the visit of Brigadier General Kaani to Aleppo's battlefields was a message. In addition, Kaani visited several districts in the southern suburbs of the province, which are under the control of the Syrian army. According to Rahmon, this trip is of great importance for regional and international forces, as it is the first after the death of Lieutenant General Kasem Soleimani. And it shows that Iran continues to support the legitimate government of Syria and the \"Axis of Resistance\", as it claims its presence in the fight against terrorism. Rahmon stressed. \"The visit of the new commander of the\" Rhodes \"forces to the south-western suburbs of Aleppo shows Iran's position in the fight against terrorism. Iran will be here until the entire Syrian territory is liberated. This is not a new issue, Iran has taken the same position from the beginning. Some suggested that after the death of Lieutenant General Soleimani, we would see a weakening of Iranian support, but Commander Kaani's visit said otherwise.\nThe \"axis of resistance\", according to Tehran, is all the countries and forces that have been defending Syria from terrorist attacks since 2012. Our readers probably remember that the authorities of Syria, Iraq, Russia, the Lebanese (Shiite) Hezbollah party, and the Shiite militias of the whole world are in the same ranks with Iran in the fight against terrorism. But at the same time, it is known that the United States is also preparing for something. On March 10, TASS quoted General Kenneth McKenzie, commander of the US Central Command (CENTCOM), as saying that the United States was moving its missile defense systems to Iraq to protect itself from a possible Iranian attack. Moreover, the Americans have taken steps to resume terrorist attacks on Iran's eastern borders. A group with close ties to the Jaish al-Adl terrorist organization has tried to invade Iran from Pakistan. Jaish al-Adl was set up by the Israeli-Israeli mediation of Pakistan, one of the militants of the Sunni militant group Jundullah, which was once defeated by Iran and has ties to al-Qaeda. However, the Americans and terrorists failed here as well, according to the leadership of the intelligence department of Sistan and Baluchestan province (Iran), the group was \"destroyed at the border by Iranian intelligence forces.\"\nAs you can see, the situation with the coronavirus, which has already been officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), does not really affect either the United States or Iran. The parties continue to prepare. it's just still hard to say exactly what. The commander of the Civil Defense Organization of Iran, Brigadier General Goliam Reza Jalali stated on March 10 that the new coronavirus has many characteristics of biological warfare, Tehran Times reported. He said further experiments were needed in laboratories to see if this was the case or if it was a war. General Jalali is the second Iranian soldier to speak out against the biological war against Iran. Last week, the commander of the ICRC, Major General Hossein Salam, announced that Iran is currently waging a biological war and will definitely win this war. \"Today we are involved in a biological war, but the country is resisting. The enemy is still focused on economic pressure and psychological operations against Iran and is using all its means to tighten the conditions of our people. The enemy is trying to create regional events in its favor. ”\nThe statements of Generals Salami and Jalali prove that the Iranian army has no doubt. The country is facing a new kind of war waged by the United States. And we will ask. Isn't it strange that the areas most affected by the coronavirus are on the same latitude, about 40 degrees north latitude? Is this a coincidence or some mysterious artificial effect? However, even Iran is in no hurry to formally accuse the United States. Everything is still ahead…\nSergey Shakaryants"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCeakmpgZsI&t=172", "title": "How coronavirus affects European policy * Eurozone (02.29.20)", "text": "Rating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

And in the United States, where the peak incidence has not yet occurred, the maximum death rate per day has been recorded. President Trump once again found the guilty.\nNew York, illuminated by the big moon, stood in suspense. Every new day brings bad news. The death toll from coronavirus is thousands. Another mortality record - 1736 people per day. The total number is almost 13 thousand.\n\"It really hurts. You wake up in the morning and don’t know what bad news will come today.

The World Health Organization became a lightning rod in a difficult situation. Trump did not rule out that the United States will stop financing WHO - today, American dollars make up the bulk of the budget of an international organization. In addition, the head of the White House does not understand why, at an early stage, when everything had just begun in China, WHO made the wrong recommendations.\n\"The World Health Organization was really wrong. Fortunately, I rejected at their early stage their advice to leave our borders open to China. Why did they give us such a bad recommendation?\" - asks US President Donald Trump.\nMeanwhile, the alleged inventor of the coronavirus was detained in Washington. Moreover - a compatriot. Harvard professor, Doctor of Biological Sciences, director of the Institute for Biological Research, Charles Liber, worked for a long time in China and, according to the American intelligence services, received an order to develop a particularly aggressive type of virus. Research was conducted just at Wuhan University of Technology. However, at some point, something went wrong. The proposed measure of influence and retaliation from Washington to Beijing is a large-scale package of sanctions, experts do not rule out. Almost one and a half million patients and more than 80 thousand deaths worldwide - these are the latest data on the spread of coronavirus in the world.\nIn the Old World, the worst situation in Spain is 142 thousand patients. According to forecasts, this is far from the limit. Russian military doctors in the Italian Bergamo began to receive patients in a field hospital. Our experts also carry out large-scale disinfection of hospitals and other facilities where patients are placed. The authorities of various settlements ask for help. In the country - large-scale quarantine.\n“It has been thirty days since we stay at home and we are glad that we are not sick. The only thing we want to do now is to thank all the doctors who work around the clock. Including the Russian doctors who help in the most affected areas. We all stay at home in the hope that this situation will end soon, \"said Giovanni Moretti.\nIt all ended in Wuhan.

They should allow maintaining the vaccination status.\nQuantum dot tattoos are applied to soluble sugar-based microneedles containing a vaccine and fluorescent quantum dots enclosed in micrometer-sized biocompatible capsules. After the microneedles dissolve under the skin, they leave the encapsulated quantum dots, samples of which can be read to identify the vaccine administered.\nIn addition to microchip implant technology, Gates is also working on a project called ID2020. Microsoft wants to “solve” the problem that just over a billion people live without a registered ID. ID2020 is designed to give them digital identification.\nGates sees the coronavirus pandemic as an excellent opportunity for the further development and application of microarray technology.\nChristian groups and, surprisingly, some Shiite Islam groups have already criticized this form of invasive body identification. Last November, the Danish technology company was forced to terminate the implantation of microchips for the Danish government and the US Navy after the resistance of Christian groups.\nGates technology will be one step closer to overall state human surveillance. Even if vaccine identification can be developed today with a positive intention, you only need to add two and two to represent the possibilities of such an observation technique.\nAccording to BioHackInfo.Com: “Quantum Dot Tattoos” include the application of soluble sugar-based microneedles that contain a vaccine and copper-based fluorescent “quantum dots” embedded in micron-scale biocompatible capsules. After the microneedles dissolve under the skin, they leave the encapsulated quantum dots, whose samples can be read to identify the vaccine being administered. ”\nA quantum pillar of science is being developed by a pillar of science like MIT, led and sponsored by Bill Gates.\nIt will be interesting to observe what people will do when they are offered the Bill Gates vaccine from COVID19 and a quantum tattoo that would allow them to work or travel.

It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\nIn this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans.\nResearchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than previously thought.\"\nIn contrast, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify \"potential risks\".\nSimon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on the news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: \"If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.\"\nIn October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on \"job promotion\", especially those causing serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans."}, {"url": "https://sputnik.by/columnists/20200409/1044407443/Koronavirus-atakuet-floty-i-armii-Zapada.html", "title": "Coronavirus attacks the fleets and armies of the West", "text": "According to the US Department of Defense on April 9, 286 sailors were infected with the coronavirus in the crew of the nuclear carrier Theodore Roosevelt. The ship moored off the island of Guam in the western part of the Pacific Ocean, out of 4,800 crew members, 1700 are in quarantine. In fact, the aircraft carrier is out of order, spare (replaceable) crews are only on strategic submarines.\nEarlier it was reported that two patients with COVID-19 were identified in the crew of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan, which is located in Yokosuka (Japan), and will not leave the base at sea soon. Probably more people were infected, as military sailors live and work in limited naval space. Not all senior officers have a separate cabin.\nBy April 6, more than 1,100 troops were infected with COVID-19 in the US Army. The largest number of infected - 431 people - was detected in the US Navy. In the National Guard (Pentagon reserve subordinate to the federal center and state of deployment), the coronavirus disabled more than 300 people.\nAn alarming situation also developed on board the French carrier Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier - 40 sailors out of 1,760 crew are suspected of being infected with a coronavirus infection. The French aircraft carrier led a multi-purpose group in the Atlantic with the Foch mission, but due to the threat of infection of the entire crew, he returns to the Toulon naval base ahead of schedule. The combat mission is not completed.\nThe submarine of the Netherlands Navy \"Dolphin\" at the end of March also interrupted combat duty in the North Sea due to an outbreak of coronavirus on board (15 sailors fell ill). Upon returning to the base of Den Helder (North Holland), the entire crew was quarantined. Combat duty is disrupted.\nSecond Pearl Harbor\nFrom a military point of view, the facts cited are not a random chain of events, but a manifestation of the low combat stability of the Navy in peacetime. Judge for yourselves: two American aircraft carriers \"at joke\" are minus two aircraft carrier strike groups (AUG) of the US naval forces. Each AUG operates as part of an aircraft carrier and ten strike ships and submarines (the total number of personnel reaches 9,000 people). That is, with the prolonged loss of combat effectiveness of “Theodore Roosevelt” and “Ronald Reagan,” the United States is losing the opportunity to demonstrate strength in key regions of the Pacific.\nThe coronavirus and the current situation virtually \"turn off\" the potential of 20 attack ships with a thousand Tomahawk sea-based cruise missiles, 180 combat aircraft (carrier-based aircraft), and a total of 18 thousand military sailors. This is the second Pearl Harbor. Moreover, the Pentagon “closes” information on the penetration of coronavirus into troops as much as possible so as not to jeopardize operational security. The real situation in the US Navy could be much worse.\nThe early return to the base of the French aircraft carrier decapitated the very important Foch mission, which was supposed to significantly expand the operational space of the naval air group and the combat capabilities of the Rafale multi-role fighters by introducing the latest electronic long-range target detection system (TALIOS). This is a serious failure.\nThe Dutch submarine \"Dolphin\" with an infected crew left the combat duty area two weeks ahead of schedule, this is a breach in the NATO naval defense system. It is impossible to quickly replace a boat with a crew; campaigns are planned months in advance (budget, supplies, training of sailors). Thus, the hypothetical enemy for two weeks received complete freedom of action in the North Sea. For the Dutch fleet, the fact is shameful.\nAnd in all the cases mentioned, against the backdrop of several months of the severe COVID-19 pandemic, the crews should simply be deprived of the coast for two to three weeks before going to sea (banal quarantine). However, the coronavirus only \"highlighted\" the insufficient margin of safety (combat stability) of the Pentagon and NATO.\nThe spirit of the \"Flying Dutchman\"\nSpecial attention is paid to the dismissal of the commander of the nuclear carrier “Theodore Roosevelt” Brett Crozier, who was belatedly concerned about the fate of the crew entrusted to him and turned for help to the central apparatus of the US Navy. In an official letter, Crozier asked the command to take decisive measures to curb the outbreak of coronavirus. By that time, 200 sailors had positive tests, the aircraft carrier was not far from the island of Guam, and rescuing the crew seemed a simple matter. However, the head of the Pentagon, Mark Esper, at first refused to evacuate the sailors. This is probably why Crozier’s alarming information has become the property of the media and the public.\nUS Navy Secretary Thomas Modley insulted the aircraft carrier’s commander, who dared “expose the problems of the US Navy in the face of the Chinese threat.” And he relieved Captain Crozier of his position for unsuitability. Then the Minister of the Navy was dismissed. More than 253,000 Americans signed up for Crozier’s reinstatement petition. And this whole story testifies to the Pentagon’s problems, the apparent neglect of the health of seafarers - naval elite, which does not add military power to the United States, and security to its allies and partners.\nToday, two US aircraft carriers are located near the Persian Gulf, \"holding back\" Iran. If the Roosevelt and Reagan crews do not recover, after a few months there will be no shift in the bay. Six aircraft carriers remain in the ranks of the U.S. Navy, including those on repair and reloading reactors. The potential of three AUGs across the entire oceans is not enough, moreover, the pandemic has not reached its peak.\nAfter five cases of coronavirus infection were detected at NATO headquarters in Belgium, the implementation of many alliance programs and exercises, including Defender Europe 2020, was stopped. COVID-19 was diagnosed with the chiefs of general staffs of Poland and the Philippines, and nine generals were quarantined in Italy. British and Greek troops were also affected. An alarming situation is taking shape in the multinational NATO battalions in Latvia and Lithuania.\nMeanwhile, Russia has retained a certain system of virological (epidemiological) safety, organs, control instruments and the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense Troops. The RF Ministry of Defense does not cancel military maneuvers. The Russian Armed Forces formed 49 mobile sanitary and epidemiological groups to identify virus carriers. Earlier, the head of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation Sergey Shoigu said that in the Russian army there are no infected Covid-19."}, {"url": "http://www.jo24.net/post.php?id=355388", "title": "Have we got the Corona virus from space?", "text": "Vyacheslav Eileen, head of the department of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, believes that the SK virus is not excluded from falling into a meteorite on Chinese soil.\n\"Chandra Wikrasingh, the famous external biologist from Cardiff University in Wales, announced several days ago that he does not rule out that the Corona virus has fallen to the ground with the meteor that exploded over China in October 2019,\" Eileen told Russian news agency RIA Novosti.\n\"Is it possible?

Today he was urgently summoned to the meeting. He returned late and did not explain anything. He only said to pack up and run to the store for groceries for two weeks. Now we are going somewhere far out of town. I don’t know what is happening, but it seems to me that it has begun ... ”\nThe main thing is to sow panic. There are such \"exclusives\" as \"... according to the Ministry of Health at 18.00 Moscow time, the number of deaths in Siberia and the Far East exceeds 112 people. Tens of thousands are already infected. Power hides a terrible truth from people. ” We have already recorded over 200 such messages in the National Values Protection Fund. There is such nonsense as “The FBI reports that in China there are already more than 100,000 dead from coronavirus. Almost 3 million are infected ... ” And then the FBI, if this organization is engaged in the agenda within America? If only the NSA or the CIA.\nWell, the US specialists from Chinas are not ceremonious at all: \"tens of thousands of dying, they are being taken to incinerators by thousands.\"\nI think, from all this, giants of the pharmaceutical market are going to have their gesheft.\nFake attacks on Sberbank\nAnd more about fakes. I have said more than once that we are completely not protected from this phenomenon.\nStanislav Kuznetsov, deputy chairman of the board of Sberbank, told reporters in Davos about the extent of the negative impact of one of the episodes of fake news, when for several hours in 2014 the bank's clients withdrew more than 250 billion rubles in ATMs. Then there was fake news that Visa cards will stop working at 00 hours 00 minutes. A massive seizure of cache from Sberbank ATMs has begun.\nAnd Sberbank regularly becomes a victim of such fake news. It’s about the commission when moving funds from card to card, then something else.\nMy question is: is there any system at the state level to combat this? The question is rhetorical.\nWho \"extinguishes\" Lyubimov?\nAbout Internet trolling and bullying. We have a new government and a new Minister of Culture Olga Borisovna Lyubimova. Young, smart, professional in this field, she headed the cinematography department. For two days, while she was in office, there was a flurry of photos with her from the time of 2010. By popularity, by all requests, it was in second place after the chairman of the government, Mishustin.\nIn these photos she is standing in a t-shirt with a cheerful print. She also caught her 2008 recordings from LJ, where she, a young journalist, reflects on different things using obscene vocabulary. It turns out that on the Internet there are so many holy people who deny a living person the right to be alive. And all this is the only incriminating evidence that they could dig up at Lyubimova. And this does her honor, which means that there is nothing else for her.\nPresident of Radio Liberty and its double standards\nHow many copies broke in discussions about the need for media agents to register their legal entities in our country. The process has begun. The international radio station Radio Liberty sent documents to the tax service for registration of a legal entity in Russia to comply with the requirements of the law. So, we will make them work in our legal field and comply with our laws. They have a pie for this from the shelf.\nNow it’s up to our regulatory bodies to watch how these media work in our country. But let's enjoy the statement by Jamie Floy, president of the Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty media corporation: “Listing Radio Liberty projects in the register of media agents is an attempt to silence independent media in Russia and deprive the audience of access to information that is not under the control of the Kremlin \". That is, when the Russian media are blocked in Europe and America - “is it another”? The beauty of the policy of double standards.\nPrison sentence for publishing someone else’s video: New Zealand as an “image of democracy”\nThe Economist has published an index of countries around the world in terms of democracy. Russia is in 134th place out of 167th. Next to us is the Republic of Congo, Guinea. Who would be surprised. But what is interesting is Norway's first place. The ten most democratic countries in the world include Iceland, Finland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. I want to remind you that New Zealand has become the first state to be jailed for insults on the Web and for publishing materials that can be considered extremist.\nA New Zealand resident, 44-year-old Philip Arps, was sentenced in June 2019 to 21 months in prison for distributing videos he didn’t shoot about shooting in Christchurch mosques. Not his video, he did not write approving comments. Just posted a video - he will spend 21 months in prison. After his release, Arps will be required to undergo a psychiatric examination, and for six months he will not have Internet access. This is a model of democracy to be looked upon.\nFox - Too Republican\nDisney will remove Fox from 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight. The 20th Century Fox logo has existed in its form since 1935. Disney bought 20th Century Fox, Fox Searchlight, and other assets from Fox Corporation in 2019 for $ 71.3 billion. The studios will be renamed so that their names are no longer associated with the Fox Corporation media holding, which owns the pro-republican FoxNews television channel.\n“Excessive demonstration of parental love”\nIn the UK, they are attacking the agenda of everyday love. At once, two parent stars were accused of the press for having fun with their children. David Beckham kissed his daughter, and Italian actor Gino Dacampo took a selfie in the morning bed with his daughter. In the media, the parents were accused of \"excessive demonstration of paternal love.\" We are waiting for the bills and decisions of the European Parliament, following the rules on parent one and parent two, on the third field. Now you can’t hug a child and you can’t be strict - in general, you can’t be any, public opinion tells us.\nThe personification of the UN\nThe new special envoy of the UN Secretary General for Syria is the Norwegian, the Viking, Geir Pedersen (as all the media write, apparently for political correctness), however, his native spelling is Geir Pedersen. And we all know that R at the end in English pronunciation is not pronounced, and after “and” comes the sound “and”. The personification of UN diplomacy, the role and influence of the UN on world processes. Sorry, as it is, it is.

An exciting report that throws oil on fire, \"Conspiracy Theory\"", "text": "Source\nRussia Today |\nThe controversy over the origin of the new coronavirus (Corona) has not subsided since it broke out in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, killing thousands and wounding about a quarter of a million people around the world.\nThis controversy escalated, especially between the United States and China, to the highest levels, as US President Donald Trump described it as a Chinese virus, while Beijing suspected that he was an American.\nAlthough scientists and specialists are now busy combating this deadly epidemic, regardless of its source, and some confirm that there are no indications of its creation and that it is a \"natural\" virus known to \"lineage\", it was exposed to a mutation that turned it into a \"killer\" that has the ability to penetrate human cells, except A report published by the American journal, Nature, known for its sobriety, still threw more oil on \"conspiracy theory\" oil.\nThis report was published on November 12, 2015, and reported that US scientists have created in the laboratory a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats in connection with a virus that causes SARS, that is, acute respiratory syndrome.\nThe magazine revealed about 5 years ago that scientists had examined a virus called \"SHC014\", which was found in horseshoe bats in China.\nThese scientists combined the surface protein of \"SHC014\" with the SARS virus, and came out with a new virus that provided the surface protein with a structure that helps it penetrate into the cells of the human respiratory system. It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\nIn this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans.\nResearchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than previously thought.\"\nIn contrast, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify \"potential risks\".\nSimon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on the news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: \"If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.\"\nIn October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on \"job promotion\", especially those causing serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans."}, {"url": "https://www.fondsk.ru/news/2020/04/09/uchebniki-po-antisovetskoj-propagande-esche-ne-sgnili-50575.html", "title": "Textbooks on anti-Soviet propaganda have not decayed yet - Strategic Culture Fund", "text": "The Italian La Stampa issued an editorial statement on April 3, in which it accused Major General Igor Konashenkov, an official spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Defense, of allegedly threatening the newspaper. “This fact risks becoming a serious precedent if our government does not require immediate clarification. And, most importantly, the necessary apologies, ”La Stampa said in a statement.\nBefore that, the newspaper published an article where, citing anonymous informants, it was alleged that the help of Russian military doctors who arrived in Italy in agreement with her government was considered in this country ... \"to be 80% useless.\"\nHead of Lombardy Attilio Fontana\nMeanwhile, Italians greeted Russian doctors with applause; in the cities of Lombardy, some residents on the streets through which the convoy passed with Russian help included the anthem of Russia. Attilio Fontana, president of Lombardy, expressed the position of the authorities of this administrative area in northern Italy: “I say“ thank you ”to Russia for the referring doctors and other staff. There is always someone - jackals who speculate on these topics. ” And the city authorities of Bergamo, where Russian specialists worked, confirmed that it was they who had the knowledge, experience and equipment to disinfect the infrastructure in the outbreak.\nGeneral Igor Konashenkov\nSo what did General Konashenkov say and what was offended by La Stampa? “Hiding behind the ideals of freedom of speech and pluralism of opinion,” the Russian general said, “in his articles, Stump manipulates the Russophobic fakes of the worst model of the Cold War, quoting the so-called opinions of anonymous“ high-ranking sources. ” At the same time, “Stampa” does not hesitate to refer to the inventions of its own authors, following the guidelines of textbooks on anti-Soviet propaganda, which, apparently, have not yet completely decayed ... As for the real customers of the Russophobic media campaign “Stamps” that we know, we recommend remembering the ancient wisdom: Qui fodit foveam, incidet in eam (Do not dig another hole, you will fall into it yourself). Or, more precisely, a fake coin will always return. ”\nIt was fueled by La Stampa with information from the British publication The Telegraph, which found a retired English colonel who said: “It would be naive to think that they [the Russians] are not collecting intelligence. This is an open goal for them. ” “The Russian military mission, which is supposedly located in Italy to help combat the coronavirus crisis, will secretly collect vital intelligence,” commented The Telegraph, a British retirement.\nThe speculation of the British retirement, common La Stampa, immediately picked up in Ukraine. The UNIAN agency retold British inventions, and the Ukrainian publication Obozrevatel reported that they rebelled against Russian aid in Italy: “Citizens created a petition with questions for the president and the government demanding to talk about the real goals of Russian military doctors who allegedly flew to fight with coronavirus” .\nIt immediately became clear that the notorious “citizens of Italy” were in fact Ukrainian zarobitchans, who had arrived in revenge on Italian streets and cleaned Italian toilets. And the petition that they were asked to draw up consists of speculation and gossip.\nAnd the answer to the question why La Stampa has taken up the dissemination of unscrupulous fiction about Russian doctors in Italy is quite simple. FIAT is the historical owner of this publication, but now 100% of La Stampa's shares are owned by Chrysler, an American automobile concern. FIAT Board Chairman John Elkann is from New York, and Managing Director Michael Manley is a native of Kent in England. Back in 2014, Anglo-American capital removed the Italians from managing their most famous automobile company, and took control of La Stampa. Behind the provocative attack of an Italian newspaper against Russian doctors are its owners, Anglo-Saxons.\nThe world-famous Italian musician Fabio Mastrangelo, now working in St. Petersburg, sent a letter of protest to the La Stampa editorial office: “This, frankly, does not comply with the principles of correct journalism.”\nAnd members of the Leo Tolstoy Cultural Association from the town of Mulazzano in Lombardy proposed to erect a monument to Russian military experts in gratitude. “In the current emergency,” said the coordinator of this organization, Marco Baratto, “we want to thank the Russian military, who are fighting an invisible and dangerous enemy, we want to thank them. When the victory over the coronavirus is won, it will be important to remember those who provided it, including the Russian military and the doctors who came to our aid. We believe that it is here, in the Lombardy region, where your specialists help the elderly ... a monument should be erected in honor of these courageous people. ”\nAccording to Marco Baratto, \"we need a real monument to the Russian military, which must be installed in the city of Bergamo.\""}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzAphcs5YTg&t=105", "title": "Moscow.

January 30. INTERFAX.RU - The Russian Ministry of Health has published a list of drugs for treating coronavirus, which includes drugs used to fight HIV, hepatitis C and multiple sclerosis.\nIn particular, the \"Chinese virus\" is supposed to be treated with the help of drugs Ribavirin, recombinant interferon beta Ib and Lopinavir / Ritonavir. According to the instructions, Rabavirin is used to treat hepatitis C, the second drug reduces the frequency and severity of exacerbations in patients with multiple sclerosis. The last medicine is used to treat HIV infection.\nEarlier, epidemiologist Gennady Onishchenko reported that about 30 existing drugs treat the new coronavirus, 12 of them are those that treat HIV. Among them are drugs such as Indinavir and Saquinavir. “All these drugs, thank God, work against this coronavirus,” the expert noted.\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Health and Rospotrebnadzor recommended conducting prophylactic drug treatment after contact with the patient. It must be carried out during the first 48 hours. The timing of this prophylaxis is set within the proposed incubation period (14 days) from the moment of the last contact with the source of infection.\nAccording to the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare as of January 30, no cases of infection with a new coronavirus from the PRC in Russia have been recorded. Checked 184 patients with signs of acute respiratory viral infections.\nAccording to the latest data from the State Health Commission of the PRC, in China, 7 thousand 711 confirmed cases of new coronavirus infection were registered.

The same disinformation scheme was used against Stalin in 1941: the Germans were approaching the capital, and the generalissimo allegedly disappeared, leaving the country, ”says Igor Panarin, professor, doctor of political sciences. Panarin said in an interview to “BUSINESS Online” about who American intelligence veterans are accused of making bio-weapons and what a tough fight has unfolded within the global and Russian elites against the backdrop of a pandemic.\n“COVID-19 is a biological weapon. Or, as it is also called in the media, a bacteriological or just a biological weapon. It has an artificial origin, like all this information wave, raised around him. ”\n“ACTIVE USE OF BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS AGAINST ALL MANKIND - THE CASE IS ABSOLUTELY UNPRECEDENTED”\n- Igor Nikolaevich, you have been analyzing the situation with coronavirus on your video channel World Politics for several weeks now. What is your personal impression: is it a virus of natural or artificial origin?\n- In this regard, I read and follow a variety of points of view, but my version is that COVID-19 is, of course, a biological weapon. Or, as it is also called in the media, a bacteriological or just a biological weapon. Unfortunately, I have practically no doubt about this. It has an artificial origin, like all this informational wave, which has been raised around it.\n- But in this case, who do you attribute to the possible developers of the coronavirus as a biological weapon? What are the indirect signs, evidence?\n- Let’s say, VeteransToday, the site of US Army and intelligence veterans (not only he, but he is the most systemic) has been voicing this version for quite some time. Moreover, this portal cites documents that the development of COVID-19 was completed in 2015. One of the centers where the secret laboratories were located was based in North Carolina, the other at Harvard, and the third in Arkansas. According to American intelligence veterans, experiments to test a new bio-weapon were conducted in the UK (including at Cambridge University), where they were funded by the Bill Gates Foundation, as well as in Australia and Canada. Moreover, the testing of some components was carried out in biological laboratories in Georgia and Ukraine. As the source indicates, a similar thing most likely happened at the Institute of Virology in Wuhan, by the way, funded by Soros, where the epicenter of infection later emerged. Although this is another question: was there an epicenter? There is evidence that one of the American doctors suffered from the coronavirus in November 2019, and this happened in the United States even before they discovered this infection in China.\n(Quote from VeteransToday: “... There is significant indirect evidence that this COVID-19 pandemic was a biological weapon that was deployed, primarily against China and Iran, but“ rebounded ”against its creators. All biological war experts say that traditionally, strategists were skeptical of biological war precisely because it has a tendency to “bounce”, hit on its own and create returns ”- approx. ed.).\n“Bill Gates is a great friend of the US Democratic Party and the main sponsor of the Clinton clan\n- And yet, who can be the customer of such a large-scale work?\n- As suggested - the former head of Microsoft and one of the richest people on the planet (and from 2009 to 2016 - the richest, according to Forbes), Bill Gates and the so-called philanthropist George Soros. Note that Gates is a great friend of the US Democratic Party and the main sponsor of the Clinton clan (the so-called Clintonites). In addition, what I call the “deep state” with its center in London is closely related to both of them. In January 2020, I put forward the version that the “headquarters” (if I may say so) of this game is located in the sad memory of the British city of Salisbury, and called for an international inspection to be sent there.\n“But what about the reports that Prince Charles of Wales contracted the coronavirus?” That Prime Minister Boris Johnson ended up in intensive care for a while?\n- I consider this a misinformation and a distraction from the British. I do not believe in the veracity of these medical reports. Moreover, Johnson, as British journalists joyfully report, is already recovering well. As for the goal of the game launched by the “deep state” - this is no more or less a blow around the world, and this, of course, has never happened before. It is safe to say that such an active use of biological weapons against all of humanity is an absolutely unprecedented case.\nIn the comments on my World Politics video channel, which I conduct on the Internet, Italians wrote to me that the staff of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (created supposedly to raise the level of healthcare throughout the world) were organized in a number of Italian cities in the fall of 2019 a series of flu shots, and then it was in these places that the greatest pestilence and mortality were observed. Although I do not think that everything should be believed from what is being told. After all, it comes to the fact that people burn cell towers, because they suspect that they are transmitting the infection. It is these “witch bonfires” that have swept Britain now. It’s hard for me to comment on this - we have all become too nervous, and not only in Russia. By the way, we still look quite calm against the general world background.\n“When the coronavirus appeared on the territory of the PRC, the employees of the western special services who used it there already had the vaccine against it. This is a very important point: the vaccine from COVID-19 may already be available! ”\n“A POWERFUL VIRUS WAS MADE IN ITALY WITH THE HELP OF THE TERRORIST NETWORK“ GLADIO ”\n- Ahead of the coronavirus pandemic, a pandemic of horror before a new infection strides around the world. And it hits many more than the virus itself.\n- Here is a very important point: today, the use of biological weapons is not exhausted, all this is accompanied by a powerful disinformation campaign, which creates humanity's problems rather mental than flu-like. At the same time, both English and Italian statisticians and analysts testify: mortality in Italy and the UK this year is even less than last year, so nothing catastrophically irreversible happens. However, the danger level is exaggerated by an order of magnitude! So this is also a large-scale social experiment, but already in the field of misinformation and fakes. Someone puts an imperious hand over the whole of Old Europe with its commitment to human rights: NATO troops have been brought into almost all European countries (supposedly in connection with future large-scale exercises). And the European Parliament, which easily resents the dispersal of the two thousandth demonstration in Moscow, for some reason is silent about this - it does not bother anyone. This is also a curious factor.\nUnfortunately, I have to admit that the vast majority of Russian media are in line with the globalist trend: they are also engaged in escalating the situation.\n- Quite right, we got some kind of armageddon online - both on TV and on the Internet. There is nowhere to hide from the array of negative information pouring on us: people were locked at home, and the only means of their communication - gadgets, social networks and instant messengers - are also full of messages about COVID-19.\n- Judge for yourself: last year, 650 thousand people died of influenza in the world (for comparison: at the time of the interview, about 97 thousand deaths from coronavirus were recorded in the world - approx. Ed.). Did anyone introduce insane fines, taxes and restrictive measures in connection with this last year? And now in Italy fines of 5 thousand euros, in France - about 4 thousand euros, and in Spain they can reach 600 thousand. To many Europeans this seems like a bad dream. Moreover, as our doctor Myasnikov noted, the mortality rate from COVID-19 does not exceed 4–5 percent. Then why is such a powerful information company deployed, coupled with an aggressive attack on human rights - on freedom of movement and so on? Let's not forget: in Russia, in Moscow, even at the very beginning of quarantine, an attempt was made to introduce digital passes ...\n“The mortality rate from COVID-19 does not exceed 4–5 percent. Then why is such a powerful information company deployed, coupled with an aggressive attack on human rights - on freedom of movement and so on? ”\n- Well, in Kazan, this attempt that you are talking about has been successful. There is even a special website issuing digital badges.\n- From Monday, the First Throne, as you know, switches to the access regime (as Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated, passes will be introduced in the capital for travel to work from April 13, but then the regime will only be tightened up to the control of movement within each district - approx. . ed.). These are obvious busts, since the degree of threat is clearly not consistent with the measures taken. Yes, a pandemic must be treated, it must be fought, but common sense should not be forgotten. Donald Trump correctly recalled the number of deaths in road accidents in the United States: for several years this tragic figure has not dropped below 40 thousand people a year. But no one forbids cars on this basis!\nIn this context, the already mentioned NATO exercises called “Defender of Europe”, Defender Europe 2020, are noteworthy. Despite all quarantine restrictions, Defender Europe 2020 (note the largest in NATO history on European territory and providing for the transfer of a 40,000th military contingent) not canceled! The leaders of the training operation simply reduced its volume. The most interesting thing is that the NATO, according to the plan, move through the most infected centers in Germany - Munich, Baden-Württemberg and Hamburg. The question arises: do they really care about the danger of getting infected?\n“Why don't you care?”\n- There is an assumption that NATO soldiers have already been vaccinated against COVID-19 and other war viruses. By the way, according to information announced on April 3 by VeteransToday, the number of war viruses can reach 89, and they were developed primarily in Cambridge, which is sponsored by Bill Gates. There is also reason to believe that when the coronavirus appeared on the territory of the PRC, the employees of the western special services that used it there already had a vaccination against it. This is a very important point: therefore, the vaccine from COVID-19 may already be available!\nAs Italian patriots informed me, the war virus was used in five countries: in China, Iran, Italy, France and Germany. And already in Spain he was brought in through France and Italy. These are viruses of different models: the most powerful one worked in Italy, the second most powerful in Iran, the third in China, etc. As for Russia, we behaved very correctly in this situation: we instantly closed from China - so neither one of our people did not get sick from the Chinese modification of the virus.\n- And this despite the fact that there were a lot of Chinese in Russia yesterday.\n“Just an incredible amount!” But the measures taken by the government of Mikhail Mishustin worked on time. However, after this was followed by a blow through Europe, and thus the virus still got into our territory. If we look at those infected in Russia, especially the first wave, it will not be difficult to notice that most of them are rich people. Many returned to the capital from Courchevel. Hence the suspicion that in Courchevel they were infected quite deliberately, so that they brought COVID-19 home. It is clear that we are talking not only about tourists, but primarily about those who have real estate abroad or their own business. They tried to infect Russia through her beloved Western civilization. Note that only from March 20 to 27, according to official figures, 160 thousand Russian citizens returned to Moscow from abroad. And Sergei Sobyanin generally cited the figure of a million people who have been on foreign trips over the past month. Did you manage to check each of them? I doubt it, although this is about the main risk groups.\n“If we look at those infected in Russia, especially the first wave, then most of them are rich people. Many returned to the capital from Courchevel. Hence the suspicion that they were infected to bring COVID-19 home \"\n- It is symptomatic that the lion's share of the infected arrived in Russia from Courchevel. This suggests how Clintonites relate to their own. After all, the Russian “Courchevel” is, albeit not so important, but also part of the global elite.\n- Yes, this just characterizes the Clintonites and their attitude towards people. But we, for our part, are obligated to track these people, since they are Russian citizens.\nHowever, in my opinion, the federal communications center for the fight against coronavirus, led by Mishustin, who appointed one of the deputy prime ministers, is not working efficiently. During the meetings that Vladimir Putin regularly holds today, they reported to him: 80 percent of those infected with COVID-19 came from abroad, and another 20 percent were mainly those who contacted them.\n- If the most powerful virus was brought to Italy, then who and how could do this?\n- According to my data, Gladio, the secret terrorist network of the NATO bloc, did this. The NATO members themselves, despite the fact that almost all of Italy is in a pandemic, are quietly moving around the country. Russia is helping the Italians — I think we sent our squad of epidemiologists and virologists to Italy with the support of a group of radiation, chemical and biological defense forces. We need to get samples of the Italian virus, to make sure what is happening there in reality, and also to fulfill the direct task of extinguishing the source of infection in a country where we have traditionally concentrated many tourists and business connections. This decision is just as true as with the sending of our specialists to Serbia.\nAs for Gladio ... After the end of World War II, a special operations department was operating inside the MI-6 British intelligence - in fact, a terrorist administration. It seems to me that it was this office, together with the agent of Winston Churchill, William Donovan, the head of the US strategic services department, who created a special terrorist structure in Western Europe and the States, as explained, in case of war with the Soviet Union. Their secondary goals are to prevent the communist government from taking power in Italy and France. In addition, they carried out terrorist acts in the West, and then wrote them off to the Communists and the KGB of the USSR.\nThe Italians wrote to me that the coronavirus in Italy distributed the same Gladio network. Prior to this, the biggest terrorist attack that the Italians related to Gladio was the explosion of the station in Bologna in 1980, during which 85 died and 200 were injured. However, some experts believe that both Al-Qaeda and Daesh (the Arabic name for the ISIS group banned in the Russian Federation - ed.), And some other banned organizations are also NATO terrorist networks, but only created inside the Islamic of the world.\nItaly was chosen as a testing ground for the use of a powerful war virus for a number of reasons, among which the presence of a large number of NATO bases, as well as good opportunities for setting up this cynical experiment, are not the least.\n“One of the main goals is to abolish the popular vote on amendments to the Constitution, scheduled for April 22. This, as we know, succeeded - the vote was postponed with an open date ”\n“FAKES WAS THROUGH THAT PUTIN fell ill, ran away from MOSCOW. HOW AGAINST STALIN IN 1941\n- What is the goal of the indirect bio-impact on Russia?\n- There are several goals. One of the main ones is to abolish the popular vote on amendments to the Constitution, scheduled for April 22. This, as we know, succeeded - the vote was postponed with an open date. The second goal is to disrupt the large-scale celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory, force them to cancel the military parade and the procession of the Immortal Regiment. We can say that the main blow fell on these plans - after all, the celebrations were conceived with the participation of the heads of many states, this should have been our triumph. In the end, I don’t know with what results we will approach May 9, but it’s already clear: a grand celebration with a large number of honored guests will not work. And what is most symptomatic: the theme of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory completely disappeared from all the Russian media, including state-owned channels - there is practically no mention of it! This is amazing! Only recently began to slip some statements of TV presenters, and then, as it were, by the way. The exceptions are the Zvezda and Spas channels, but this is clearly not enough. And at the same time, mind you, the country is for the third week forced to be at the TV.\nPeople from 108 countries are subscribed to my video channel. So, they write to me from Ukraine that the Inter TV channel, associated with businessman Dmitry Firtash, reports every morning which city or town the Red Army liberated that day in 1945. Do we have anything like that? Not even a sound on Russian state channels! I think that this shows up almost completely the external management of the Russian media, including state television channels. At the same time, a whole stream of “desa” and fakes poured into our information space — through the media of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the like, and all this was instantly quoted by Russian media. And there was practically no reaction from those who are required to monitor all this. Even a fake order for allegedly preparing to send troops to Moscow, which was distributed on behalf of the Minister of Defense, was followed by a refutation only after a week! During this time, information spread across social networks and the media and only worsened the panic.\n“The second goal is to disrupt the large-scale celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory, to force the cancellation of the military parade and the procession of the Immortal Regiment.” The celebrations were conceived with the participation of the heads of many states ”\n- Why did this become possible?\n- I think that part of the Russian elite acted and continues to act in alliance with external players - with the British and others. Accordingly, I would really like to know which part. It seems to me that the game on the side of the enemy began to be felt very sharply at the end of March, but Putin withstood it, although tremendous pressure was put on him. It got to the point that certain telegram channels, behind which there are forces very influential in the Russian Federation, demanded that the Russian president resign.\n“Or they wrote that Putin, having talked to the chief physician of Kommunarka, became ill with a coronavirus ...”\n- Yes, they wrote about it. The fact that Putin’s health no longer allows him to rule the state. “To whom will power pass?” - anonymously exclaimed pathetically. I watched these telegram channels, and I imagine who is behind them - often these are very serious government officials. A tough struggle within the elites has unfolded especially after Valentina Tereshkova in the State Duma came up with a proposal to nullify the presidential term for Vladimir Putin. In fact, immediately after this there followed a tough disinformation attack on Vladimir Vladimirovich with the aim of breaking it and forcing him to move away from the decision. The fakes were thrown in that Putin was not just ill, but had fled from Moscow and was being treated either in Valdai or in Sochi. It was exactly the same disinformation scheme that was used against Stalin in 1941: the Germans were approaching Moscow, and the generalissimo allegedly disappeared, disappeared from the capital and left the country to its fate. But Putin found among his circle people on whom he could rely, and with several video messages showed that he was keeping the situation under control.\nFakes were thrown in that Putin was not just ill, but that he had escaped from Moscow. It was the same scheme that was used against Stalin in 1941: the Germans were approaching Moscow, and the Generalissimo left the country to the mercy of fate. ”\nStrange as it may seem, they tried to strike the third information blow through Boris Johnson. When the news spread that COVID-19 was discovered inside the British royal family and that Johnson himself fell ill and was looking for someone to transfer power to, some analysts were quick to draw parallels with Putin. Say, but what about us? What will we do in the same situation?\nHowever, Vladimir Putin showed everyone that he was still in shape: in addition to a conference call, a videoconference with governors and enterprises of the military-industrial complex, he held a number of direct working meetings, and this was the answer to those who press on him both from the outside and from the inside. The fight, in my opinion, has now passed into a decisive phase. But the Russian leader was supported by a telephone conversation with Donald Trump, which once again confirmed that their positions on the main issues are close. The union of Putin and Trump, in my opinion, testifies that London globalists should be defeated.\n- But sociologists testify that Tereshkova’s proposal for \"zeroing\" was perceived by society mainly negatively.\n- Yes, for many it caused a negative rejection, and for me - full support. Why? \"Zeroing\" does not at all mean that in 2024 Vladimir Putin will go on another presidential term. Three to four years before that - what can I talk about? But the very possibility of such a choice gives stability to the Russian political structure. After coronavirus hysteria, we will inevitably wake up in another world, the economic decline will be observed not only in our country, but also in Europe and in China. It is completely incomprehensible whether Xi Jinping as the leader of the PRC will survive in this situation. Or will global anti-Russian liberals come to power in the Middle Kingdom? Yes, and what will happen to Trump - will he retain the presidency? I think that in the current uncertainty, Putin’s change is completely unacceptable.\nIf the situation stabilizes and is favorable in relation to us, the decision on the year 2024 can be made with greater clarity and ease than now.\n“Many experts were more inclined to believe that Mishustin was an intermediate, temporary figure, designed to divert attention, etc. However, in my opinion, Putin, appointing Mikhail Vladimirovich, decided on a historic step”\n“IF NOW THE SECOND GOVERNMENT OF MEDVEDEV WAS SITTING AT THE PLACE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF MUSHUSTIN, THE COUNTRY WOULD WAIT FOR A FULL COLLAPSE”\n- How important are the amendments to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, since, in your opinion, such a serious struggle has unfolded around them?\n- I can say that I am one of the few political scientists who supported the appointment of Mikhail Mishustin as Prime Minister (from January 16, 2020 - approx. Ed.). Many other experts (we will not call them) were more inclined to believe that Mishustin is an intermediate, temporary figure, designed to divert attention, etc. However, in my opinion, Putin, appointing Mikhail Vladimirovich, decided on a historic step. Imagine: if the old government of Dmitry Medvedev would sit in place of the Mishustin government! The country would surely have expected a complete collapse - the economy, social life, etc.\nThe complex of amendments that were going to be adopted on April 22, I call the left-wing conservative turn. Why? Let us again turn to the figure of Mikhail Mishustin. This man for many years financially supported the monastery of Seraphim of Sarov in Diveevo, and did not advertise it too much. And on January 15, when the head of state announced the appointment of a new prime minister, it was, according to the Orthodox calendar, just the day of St. Seraphim of Sarov! For this reason, some priests stated that it was this saint who was canonized, by the way, by Emperor Nicholas II, as the heavenly protector of the current head of government.\nMishustin regularly participated in meetings on the development of constitutional amendments, one of which includes, as we know, introducing the concept of God into the Constitution of the Russian Federation. It is very important. Second: the social benefits of citizens are now also fixed. One of the problems of modern Russia is the eerie, growing stratification between rich and poor. This stratification is more significant than in Europe and the USA, and it is dangerous, fraught with shocks. Now it is somewhat softened, damped.\nAnother important point. For Russia, the question of the transit of power always looked very painful. And this is not only under Stalin, but also in Tsarist times, beginning with Peter I, Paul I, and even earlier.\n- Well then, another principle worked - hereditary.\n- Nevertheless, we have a lot of examples of negative transit, when the power passed into the wrong hands. Here, Vladimir Putin earlier began counterplay in January 2020, thereby preventing the destabilization, which, from my point of view, was planned for March. In turn, our strategic adversary prepared three things. The first is the NATO exercises Defender Europe 2020 with the concentration of alliance forces at the European borders of Russia. Usually they object to this: yes, what are these 20-40 thousand fighters, it's nothing! Yes, nothing if they are going to reflect. And if you are not going to and some part of the elite is ready to give a completely different team? Well, the second point is, of course, bioviruses launched from various geographical points. The third point: a completely rabid information company around the coronavirus, at the same time directed against Putin. The factors I have listed coincided, as I think, not by accident - someone was preparing all this! But the Russian leader was ahead: he began his game back in January with the appointment of Mishustin.\nOf course, the left-wing conservative turn of Russian politics does not suit the globalist London and the financial circles behind it. Therefore, now we are approaching a decisive episode of the confrontation.\n“Operation COVID-19 was to lead to the overthrow of three world leaders: Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. That is, this is a game against the triumvirate, against three specific political regimes ”\n“THE COVID-19 OPERATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OUT OF THE THREE WORLD LEADERS: PUTIN, TRUMP AND XI JINGPING”\n“But Russia is not the main goal of the coronavirus war.” The most affected party to date is Italy, where more than 18 thousand people have already died. And in which country came the second most powerful blow?\n- In Iran. The number of infected there exceeded 66 thousand, more than 4 thousand people died (data as of April 10 - approx. Ed.). Incidentally, the commander of the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps), Hossein Salami, said in early March that this was a real “biological attack” undertaken by the United States against China and Iran. “Today, the country is in a biological battle,” Salami said then. “But even today we will win the fight against the virus.” “The US should know that if they did, the virus will return to them!”\nAt the same time, let's recall that the infection in Iran not least began to spread from the city of Qum - and this is not only the holy city of Shiites, the spiritual and administrative capital, but also a place located in close proximity to the nuclear facilities of the Islamic Republic. So the point for striking was not chosen by chance. Similarly, in China. What is Wuhan? This is the city of the first Chinese revolution - it was after the Wuchang Uprising that happened there in 1911 that the Qing Empire fell. And under Mao Zedong, it was the center of the \"cultural revolution\", where there were especially many hunweibins. Thirdly, this is the interweaving of many transport nodes: airways, railways and river arteries (the Yangtze River flows there). Thus, in both Iran and China, symbol cities of great importance for their states were chosen as targets.\nI believe that with respect to China, there was no less than the idea of overthrowing Xi Jinping. In general, if we talk about the operation COVID-19 as complex, then, in addition to destabilizing the world, it should have led to the overthrow of three world leaders: Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. That is, it is a game against the triumvirate, against three specific political regimes.\nThe first blow fell on Xi Jinping, but he did not have time to properly prepare for it. According to my information, on March 3-5, traditional parliamentary meetings were scheduled in XI, during which Xi Jinping planned to dismiss the current government and undertake a large purge of the Chinese elite from liberals and “Komsomol members\" (party functionaries are called \"Komsomol members\" in China coming from the bottom and rising up thanks to the Komsomol structures. The Komsomol party is opposed to the party of the “princes” born within the privileged nomenclature layer - ed.). But he did not have time to do this. In November 2019, the first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in China, and between January 20 and 30 a strong outbreak occurred, provoked, apparently, from the outside. Infected appeared literally in all regions and provinces of the Middle Kingdom. After that, on February 24, it was decided to postpone the meeting of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China.\n- And how strong are the Chinese Komsomol members? Many speak of them in a negative way, although there is nothing shameful in being a native of the lower classes and achieving everything yourself. These are people from the Chinese people. Or are they controlled by someone from outside?\n- In China, the leader of the \"Komsomol\" is considered the current head of government, Li Keqiang, and he has enough supporters. My point of view: the Komsomol cohort of the PRC is connected with London globalists. This is a kind of internal informal party - like the Clintonites in the USA or liberals, syslibs in the Russian Federation, which dominate our financial and economic bloc.\nHowever, their dominance is no longer unconditional. Unlike his friend Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin managed to begin the purge of the elite, and he did this in saving January, dismissing the government of Dmitry Medvedev. In the new cabinet, in addition to Mishustin himself, there are very strong statesmen, among them is First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov. By the way, he is the only one from the financial and economic government bloc unconditionally recognized the annexation of Crimea, all the rest were extremely cautious in their statements. I consider him a Russian sovereign, strongly support his appointment and consider the Mishustin-Belousov bunch as very strong. I believe that their efforts in the current difficult conditions keep the Russian economy afloat, there is no gross price increase, and all the simplest necessary products - flour, sugar, pasta, potatoes and others - are in stores. Let the cereals and canned goods at first, in the days of the greatest excitement, dare from the shelves, but the panic has passed, and the ghost of starvation is definitely not visible ahead.\nMishustin is generally very efficient, he is a skilled organizer. Other key figures surrounded by Putin are Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev, FSB Director Alexander Bortnikov and Pskov Metropolitan Tikhon (Shevkunov). These are those people who can unconditionally be attributed to the root figures of the Putin team.\nIn addition to the January personnel cleaning in March, we managed to inflict an oil counterattack ...\n- Do you mean Russia's exit from the OPEC oil deal?\n- Yes, and I think this is the right decision.\n- And the fact that prices per barrel then fell to 13-15 dollars?\n- But now they have already risen again: Brent crude oil is trading at $ 36 per barrel, and new agreements to reduce oil production have already been reached. Under the conditions of these price fluctuations, we will stretch, and they - our competitors - are unlikely. I mean not only the Saudis, but also the United States. Before, Trump had every reason to be proud of his achievements: in three years he organized 7 million new jobs and reduced unemployment. Next November, the 45th president of the United States had an 80 percent chance of winning the next presidential election. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders against his background looked just ridiculous. And suddenly the crisis caused by the coronavirus gives Trump again 4 million unemployed. So now the chances of the owner of the White House are significantly reduced.\nIt seems to me that bioweapons are also being used inside the United States - we can say that this is the sixth target besides Italy, Iran, China, France and Germany. According to VeteransToday, the \"American Taliban\" (as they called it) deliberately spreads viruses in the United States. The local goal, I repeat, is to dump Donald Trump.\nNote that within Russia COVID-19 is not yet being distributed at such a speed. The first two cases of coronavirus infection were recorded in late January. Nevertheless, the epidemic still has not been able to cover all of the Russian regions, and in some subjects, thank God, the score goes not only to tens, but to units of cases. That is, the spread of infection throughout the country (and our country, of course, is large - you can’t argue with that) is rather low. Italy had 7 days, and China - 10 to be fully covered by the pandemic.\n“The flight of Vladimir Putin to Damascus on January 7 and his meeting with Bashar al-Assad, I believe, prevented the war. It was very risky, but Putin did it. ”\n\"COMPETITION BETWEEN BETWEEN TWO MODELS OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT -\" RUSSIAN WAY \"AND\" BRITISH WAY \"\n- Why Putin, Trump and Xi Jinping, as you say, came under attack? In the context of geopolitics, they are competitors, not allies. Or was you looking at the possibility of some kind of union of conservative world leaders?\n- I suppose that the communication of these three leaders should gradually lead to a “new Yalta” - similar to the Yalta conference in February 1945. And this could happen very soon - according to my version, the most successful moment for such negotiations could be June of this year, and Belgrade would be the most suitable place. Why Belgrade? That would be deeply symbolic. In the capital of Serbia is the only monument in the world to Emperor Nicholas II. Yes, the last Russian tsar had many weaknesses. I personally criticize him for the fact that in January 1917 he did not dare to take emergency measures and personnel cleaning - unlike, by the way, from Putin himself, who made timely decisions in January 2020. But under Nicholas the Last, the Trans-Siberian Railway was built - 9 thousand kilometers of railroad tracks, very important for the future empire. Russia's population has increased by 60 million - what other government can boast of this? But the main thing is that at the initiative of the Russian emperor the first peaceful Hague conference of 1899 was convened, which put forward the concept of the peaceful development of mankind. The conference opened on the birthday of Nikolai Alexandrovich - such was the proposal of the Danish queen, who appreciated the merits of Romanov in her convocation. We offered a world without conflict and war. Russia was virtually self-sufficient, its population grew, the economy developed. This did not suit the British, who proposed their own path of war. It was London that did everything to unleash the First World War, which resulted in the collapse of the Ottoman, Russian, German and Austro-Hungarian empires. Then followed the Second World War - as a continuation of the same path.\nIn fact, the competition between these two models of human development continues today. One of them can be called “the Russian way”, and the other - the “British way”. Therefore, the goal of a possible meeting between Putin, Trump and Xi Jinping was to prevent another world war, which can occur both in hot form and in the form of bio-war (which happened at the moment). This is the first. The second thing the three world leaders should agree on is the liquidation of the NATO bloc as an aggressive structure. Third, the creation of a new model of the world, which could be expressed on the Eurasian continent, including in the geopolitical union of Germany, Austria, Italy, Russia and Belarus (I call this GIArussia). Another likely alliance is the Balkan Confederation, centered in Belgrade. Then “Franconia” - France, Belgium, Spain, Scotland. In the north - the conditional \"Hanseatic League\" - Scandinavia and the Baltic countries. Well, England and Holland - they also could have formed an alliance. Plus the Arian space - Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain. And in the Middle East - Assyria (Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Cyprus, Palestine), etc. All this is necessary in order to completely cut off the possibility for Britain to ever organize any kind of war.\nOf course, this is nothing more than my proposal, my hypothesis on a new picture of the world that Putin, Trump and Xi Jinping could come to together. Not so long ago, on December 16, 2019, an international conference was held in Qatar (Doha), where I also had the opportunity to participate. The level of the conference was quite high - there was attended by the UN Deputy Secretary General, heads of state, several thousand guests from 104 countries. At this event, I expressed the idea of the need for a triple meeting and did not meet any rejection or objection. But this is a discussion platform, and there are a variety of ideas.\n- How effectively do you manage to keep the blow to Trump? It seems that he is in the most vulnerable position.\n- Donald Trump, in my estimation, holds the blow brilliantly. Let us recall how the year began - with the assassination of Iranian General Kassem Suleimani on January 3. This opened a direct path to a large-scale military conflict, but the flight of Vladimir Putin to Damascus on January 7 and his meeting with Bashar Assad, I believe, prevented the war. It was very risky, but Putin did it. Most likely, the removal of Suleymani was carried out without Trump’s knowledge, but for obvious reasons he couldn’t say this publicly. However, look at what is happening now: you almost don’t notice this behind the smoke screen of the coronavirus, but the Americans are leaving Iraq, all the bases are practically left empty. This is a huge event. However, this topic is hardly covered in the media, at least in the Russian ones.\nYes, Trump withstood the blow and did not get involved in the war, but what did it cost him? According to some reports, on February 2, 2020, an assassination attempt was to be held on an American president in Florida, in a government residence. Nevertheless, this was prevented. My personal version is that Trump intelligence proactively destroyed two CIA planes along with terrorists: one allegedly crashed in Afghanistan, and the second in Iraq. CIA colonel Michael D'Andrea, known as Ayatollah Mike, who led the entire operation to eliminate Suleimani in Baghdad, was apparently killed along with them.\nIf some conspiracy theories are true, then in April the United States plans to arrest global clintonites, pedophiles, etc. Along the way, a devastating blow can be inflicted on the Fed in the form of its nationalization. This should significantly weaken the position of opponents of trump.\n“Do you remember the shooting at Lubyanka on December 19, 2019? It happened on the same day as Putin’s big press conference and on the eve of KGB Day. This is an attack against the Russian special services, and personally against Putin. ”\n“AFTER SHOOTING ON THE LUBE, PUTIN DECIDED ON CARDINAL CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE STATE”\n- Who are they, opponents of Trump? You call them Clintonites, liberals, or “deep state” - deep state. What lies behind all these concepts?\n- The center of deep state is London. In the hands of these people are three large-scale instruments. The first is the deepest state of the United States; its political “roof” is Bill Clinton and his “family”, the financial, economic and partly ideological bloc is George Soros and Bill Gates, and the power bloc is part of the CIA and the Ministry of Defense (but not completely). The American deep state was created by Winston Churchill and William Donovan, the then leader of the American OSS, after World War II. Another tool is the Fed, the US Federal Reserve, and the third is the global media, including in Russia. I urge Russian television channels to show films about the Great Patriotic War, but just yesterday, one of the federal channels spent the whole day spinning James Bond films. My subscribers write to me that, for example, in Japan, viewers also expect historical and patriotic films from their television, and there - Bondiana, the same as ours. By the way, much to my disappointment, the RT channel - Russia Today - increasingly plays on the side of globalists, in a globalist trend. Information about Russia there is no more than 8–9 percent, and that is mainly in a negative format.\nDo you remember the shooting at Lubyanka on December 19, 2019? It happened on the same day as Putin’s big press conference and on the eve of Chekist’s Day (celebrated on December 20 - ed.). With the naked eye, it was clear that this was an attack against the Russian special services and personally against Putin. And what? RT gives 19 reports in English from the scene. And when two extraordinary events happen in the United States a week later - the shooting of a church, an attack on a synagogue and a rabbi’s house, the same channel broadcasts six times less stories.\nIt is no coincidence that on December 19, liberals of all stripes appeared at the FSB building, who broadcast what was happening online, exaggerating the incident many times and escalating panic (up to the point that messages skipped as if some of the building on Lubyanka was captured by unknown people). Although, if not for the actions of our counterintelligence, an attack on the FSB building could have been much larger. So the liberals, in fact, broadcast what was supposed to happen, according to some plans, but it didn’t happen, because it was adjusted (as a result of the shooting at Lubyanka, three people died, including the alleged criminal Evgeny Manyurov, and five were injured - approx. Ed.). I am almost convinced that after this incident, Vladimir Putin estimated the scale of the impending provocation and decided to make fundamental changes in the structure of the state that followed in January. He began, as I said, a left-wing conservative reversal, actually repeating Trump to some extent.\n- In general, is there an alternative to global media? In addition to the “Twitter” Trump and the American television channel Fox News, it is difficult to recall anything else.\n- A curious touch: after a telephone conversation between Putin and Trump, on April 1, the Russian An-124 aircraft with cargo to help fight the coronavirus landed at the New York airport, only one American television channel, Fox News, constructively reported. And none of the many American media! But this is already familiar. Donald Trump works in a situation where 92 percent of media reports about him are negative, and only 8 percent are neutral or supportive.\n- What is your forecast: will quarantine measures be lifted by May 9? Will we defeat the coronavirus, at least for the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory?\n- Now proposals are being made to postpone the celebrations until June 24 - in honor of the first Victory Parade held by Joseph Stalin on that day. I do not exclude that on June 24, you can also organize celebrations - at least some of them. But let's recall that on November 7, 1941, under much more difficult conditions, Stalin adopted a military parade. As Sergei Shoigu reports, currently there is not one coronavirus infected among the Russian military personnel. So, the parade can and should be held. And it's time to return the patriotic themes to at least state-owned channels and near-state media. This will defuse the situation and reverse the negative flow of information that continues to spill over us: messages not about the recovered, but about the dead, etc. This is an obvious suppression of the psyche of people who are now at home, in self-isolation.\nHowever, in my deep conviction, we have already passed the crucial point of the crisis. Of course, if Putin had not taken decisive action in January, then in March Russia would have entered a terrible period of destabilization.\nI talked about the triumvirate of Putin - Trump - Xi Jinping. So, in this three, in my opinion, the leader is the Russian president. It is completely unacceptable to withdraw it now or even after 2020 from the game. The new construction of the world is just beginning to take shape, and we must give all of us time to enter the future with the least losses for Russia.\nIgor Panarin (born October 30, 1958) is a Russian political scientist, candidate of psychological sciences, doctor of political sciences, professor at the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, full member of the Academy of Military Sciences.

He proposed the subordination of the Voice of Russia radio station and the RIA Novosti news agency to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (hereinafter, on the basis of the created structure, the formation of a foreign political media holding as part of the Russian Foreign Ministry) and the creation of non-governmental organizations of Russia operating in the CIS, EU and USA.\nIn January 2006, he proposed the creation of Eurasian Russia as an interstate entity according to the model of the European Union on the territory of the post-Soviet space headed by the sovereign (according to Machiavelli), which would restore and strengthen economic integration, with the gradual accession of a number of Balkan and other countries. Proposed by Vladimir Putin as the first sovereign of Eurasian Russia.\nIn February 2006, for the first time, it proposed to create an oil and gas exchange in Russia for rubles (the exchange opened in St. Petersburg on September 24, 2008, and in March 2009 Rosneft sold 6.7 thousand tons of oil products at auction for 97 million rubles ) In addition to NK Rosneft, Gazprom Neft, Lukoil, Surgutneftegas and TNK-BP planned to enter the exchange.\nIn January 2009, he proposed the creation of a five-way commission, an expert mechanism for international consultation on how to overcome the global crisis.\nOn March 27, 2009, Panarin took part in a lecture by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, which took place in the Large Mansion of the Russian Foreign Ministry. After the lecture, Panarin commented on the need to introduce a new world currency ACYURE (the name was invented by Panarin himself) based on three leading world currencies: AKU (Asian Monetary Unit is a conventional monetary unit, in fact a virtual basket of more than 10 currencies, the average rate of which is conventionally calculated using one from research institutes in Japan, no decision has ever been made \"on the creation of a monetary unit\" with such a name), the ruble and the euro, as well as the discussion of proposals by Russia and China on new world currency at the G20 summit in London. In his opinion, it is precisely the introduction of ACURE that is agreed upon by 20 countries that will make it possible to seamlessly switch to a new model of world development.\nIn April 2009, he proposed the integration of Eurasia as one of the means to overcome the global financial and economic crisis, including the development of a joint SCO anti-crisis program and the rejection of the dollar in mutual settlements between the SCO member countries in favor of a two-currency basket (consisting of two currencies - the RMB and the ruble) and new SCO currency. Panarin put forward the idea of switching to mutual settlements of three levels: national currencies; ruble or yuan; a two-currency basket (rubleyuan), and also invited the SCO countries to submit a joint proposal on the introduction of a new world currency ACYURE for the next meeting of 20 countries in the fall of 2009.\nOn May 20, 2009, he began conducting his author's weekly radio program World Politics at the Voice of Russia radio station.\nMember of several international conferences and exhibitions (Austria, Great Britain, Germany, Greece, India, Spain, USA, etc.).

Especially about the \"vote\" and Putin!\nAfter all, these people do not even understand the “simplest global things” - that the state of London City and the United Kingdom with the capital London are completely different, opposing, and the main forces are:\nof which two, for today:\n1. \"globalists\" (some of them are called \"Jesuits\" or even Satanists, \"US Democrats, US liberals and most in the world) - these can really be attributed to\" Democrats - the Clintons, liberals and part of the elite of many countries - especially under control - Italy, Spain, France, and our first persons (although the GDP is rather rushing between the \"centers of power.\" And briefly their goals are the primacy of the interests of global companies over national-state and \"universal values\" over the rights and freedoms of each person and their management in the interests of these globoco nies and \"OCHTS\"!\n2. \"Isolationists\" - \"republicans\" - \"patriots\" - it’s more like the Queen’s supremacy and the countries she leads, and then Trump, the “republicans” and part of the ruling elites, which can most likely be attributed to the patriots of their countries, nations, the Law of citizens and peoples decide for yourself.\nAnd so it turns out that the “coronavirus operation” is carried out by “globalists”, with the goal of driving the whole world into one “digital concentration camp” and using viruses to maintain a “world order”! Since most medical organizations are under the control of the Jesuits, the majority of ruling elites (in which, nevertheless, the majority of the 2 groups, thanks to the archaic outdated election system), including the Russian Federation, have not yet introduced the KARANTIN regime itself, although all the mass misinformation is trying to convince citizens that this is exactly what needs to be done! But then the power passes over The control of the 1st group is official! Therefore, in most countries, including the Russian Federation, “self-isolation” was invented - the ruling class does not want to lose control and transfer ALL into the hands of the 1st group!\nAnd now, from this point, one can explain the fantastic difference, which almost reaches 100 times, in the official “mortality” from the coronavirus - where the health authorities and those who keep statistics are “globalists,” there is “terrible horror” - this is Italy, Spain (understandably, Catholics), France and ... USA! Moreover, Trump then tried to resolve, such as “we’ll recover faster - faster immunity,” but then he went “howling at the indignant public,” demanding “not to hide the horror of the coronavirus,” that is, to record all those who died with coronavirus as deaths from coronavirus, although in total mortality is not growing anywhere!\nAlthough they started this special operation prematurely - six months - a year earlier than planned. Because Trump and the \"isolationists\" are conducting systematic work to actually destroy the \"Clinton Democrats\" and to \"clean up\" this entire group from the \"elite\"!\nSo against the backdrop of \"terrible horror - the US withdrawal to the 1st place in infection and deaths\", there were inconspicuous reports that Trump began revising the results of September 11, 2001. and in the coming days, the beginning of the investigation and the initiation of criminal cases on the fact of mining and explosions of the WTC buildings is possible. There is also a not very noticeable, but effective war in another direction. Here is the scandalous condemnation of Wanshtein for the rape of Hollywood stars - one of the results. After all, it’s much more important to hit not on the Clintons themselves but on their sponsors. (Vanstein is just).\nSo this is the 3rd or 4th world war - only it is not between states, but between ruling elites within almost all states. Where the prisoners are just all the peoples “self-isolated”, and the victims of the war - not only from viruses, including the coronavirus - die much more from the psychotropic war, but they are not even included in the statistics! 23 plus or minus reply Anonymous 12.04.2020 10:23\nPan, read Volkov less.

According to her, 95% of those infected have not yet been registered by the authorities, which means that in a couple of weeks in one Wuhan there will be hundreds of thousands of cases. With an observed mortality from the virus of 2.36% - this is many thousands of deaths. In fact, the new work is more likely to “catch hype” or, if you like, trying to keep the world on guard than it describes a real epidemic. Recent data on the infectivity of coronavirus show: it is really brilliantly transmitted from person to person. This is enough for an epidemic in China, but a large number of victims outside this country is unlikely. We find out why.\nUPD The article is continued.\nA group of researchers led by Jonathan Reed of the University of Lancaster tried to predict the magnitude of the ongoing epidemic of the new coronavirus 2019. In an article posted on the medRxiv research server, they calculated that by January 21 there were 11 thousand infected, and by February 4 there would be almost 200 thousand.\nToday, the death rate from the new virus is 2.37% - 107 out of 4515 cases. If the authors of the new work were right, Wuhan alone is doomed to lose many thousands of lives only in the coming February.\nInfectiousness Index: fairly moderate\nMost of the works on medRxiv are labeled as “not reviewed”. New - from this number. Consequently, the obvious mistakes of the authors there may not be caught by reviewers. Scientific review takes a long time, but it’s possible to understand today whether the authors are right or not.\nA key parameter of any epidemic is a basic indicator of infection reproduction. It is equal to the number of people who can be infected by the average carrier of infection. Any epidemic spread model calculates this indicator: and the higher it is, the more contagious the disease and the more powerful the epidemic.\nThe record holder here is ordinary measles. In an unvaccinated (and not sick with measles in childhood) population, one patient infects with it an average of 15 people. Such an infection is extremely dangerous even with low mortality: in a society without a vaccine, almost everyone suffered from measles, exceptions are extremely rare. Even with a mortality rate of 0.1% globally, many millions would die from such a disease.\nIn the new work, the figure of 3.8 (the average number of the interval 3.6-4.0) was taken as the base reproduction rate for coronavirus 2019-nCoV: 10 patients will transmit the disease to 38 new victims. In determining the indicator, Jonathan Reed's group relied on an article by Chinese authors on January 21.\nBut the enormous weakness of the work was that in the first stages of the spread of any new disease with \"usual\" symptoms, the number of cases with it is underestimated. Temperature, dry cough and rapid fatigue are typical symptoms of various diseases, many will not go to any doctor with them. As often happens, some of us only want to go to the hospital when they have taken them seriously.\nBut when the wave of information about the epidemic went through TV and the Internet, when bulldozers began to pour soil on the roads leading to Wuhan - then a lot of people rushed to register their problems in the hospital, showing a sharp, but short burst of “infectivity index”. Then suddenly there are few patients, then many at once.\nHowever, the latest data on the 2019-nCoV Infection Index is completely different. As noted by the same Jonathan Reed, the “infectivity index” is only 2.5 (the middle of the range is 2.4-2.6). It seems that 3.8 and 2.5 are slightly different numbers. In fact, with an index of 3.8, one patient, having launched only ten infection cycles, is able to infect more than 627 thousand people. And with an index of 2.5 - only 9.5 thousand.\nThe difference, as we see it, is tens of times so big that now Reed’s work is of historical value only. The author, however, plans to upgrade it in order to take into account the real “infectivity index”. But until then one can confidently say: the forecast of his group is not particularly valuable - and this is to say the least.\nWhy did this virus appear in China and why is it so moderately infectious?\nA lot of funny explanations go around the Web about why all these SARSs and the like so often arise in China, and not elsewhere. Someone says that the Chinese simply do not care enough about hygiene, some - that there is bad medicine, someone - that they eat too much raw meat and exotic animals. All this is not entirely true.\nLet's start with the basics. The Chinese have normal hygiene: they invented toilet paper and started its widespread production in an era when the ancestors of all who read this text did not think about the problem beyond burdock (not very common in winter). They are also good with medicine: life expectancy there is almost like in the USA and much higher than in Russia, despite lower GDP per capita.\nNot very roasted meat is eaten in many countries, including the same States, but this does not make them a source of epidemics. To understand what exactly makes China the source of a viral (and not only) deadly infection, you need to understand where viruses live well on Earth.\nViruses are organisms (however, other scientists do not consider them alive in the full sense of the word), which have an extremely high ability to change rapidly. They have the highest mutation rate among all known organisms, so they can constantly present slightly different variants of themselves. Such, say, the flu: due to the ultra-high speed of mutations (more only in HIV), it bypasses vaccines created against strains of the same flu, but from past years.\nTo achieve such powerful variability, viruses use the mechanisms that we humans lack. In our country, the diversity of genes is supported by sexual selection: women like men whose leukocyte antigens are least similar to the genes of this woman (women are very likely to distinguish such men by smell).\nViruses and bacteria formally do not have sexual reproduction, but, in fact, often the virus can exchange genetic material with another virus. It is not always clear exactly how they do it, because it is difficult to observe such processes. In bacteria, this is done with the help of sexual (they are called sexual (sex pili) because of their distant similarity with the means of sexual reproduction) pili, protein filaments on the surface of the bacteria. In viruses, mechanisms should be noticeably simpler.\nBut their essence is one. In general terms, it is the same as ours, sexually transmitted organisms: the exchange of part of the genetic material. Just as small groups of people risk degeneration due to insufficient genetic diversity, so the pathogens of infections the greater the diversity, the more around other organisms with which they can exchange genetic material.\nFor viruses and bacteria, the task is simplified by the fact that they can exchange it not only with representatives of the species, but also with anyone. By the way, in fact, such a horizontal gene transfer from another species is possible in humans, only on a modest scale.\nAll this means that China is the promised land for infectious agents. Many carriers - more opportunities to maintain the genetic diversity of the virus itself. And this is not only a high population density (in India it is no less), but also because it is warm and humid. Because of this, many mammals and birds in China can live in a territorially very small area. This is important: the presence of many warm-blooded living species is a necessary condition for the maturation of truly terrible epidemics.\nThe fact is that the virus itself, for a long time “cohabiting” with a person, cannot be too dangerous for him. The measles virus causes diseases in us for about a thousand years (before that, it parasitized on livestock). And already during this time, the probability of dying from him has fallen to one person per thousand without good treatment, and even lower - in the presence of the latter.\nThe HIV virus is much worse for us: without treatment for about ten years, most die. But this is only because the transfer of the virus from the green monkey to humans happened a few decades ago (most likely, this disaster would not have happened if it had not been for some frivolity of the sexual behavior of people in Africa).\nBut if you ask a virologist to name a massive virus that would give a high probability of death, but at the same time live with a person for at least thousands of years in a row, he will think about it. The reasons are that war with the host species is not beneficial for the virus. It is much easier to multiply quietly inside it, without undermining the work of the host organism by excessive reproduction.\nAnother thing is if the virus has recently “spread” to our species from another species. It has not yet settled down in the body of a new host, therefore, the host’s immunity cannot suppress the virus really effectively, and the virus itself has not particularly adapted to the new “house,” which causes great harm to it.\nFor example, it happened with the flu virus thousands of years ago or smallpox (we picked them up from livestock). Sometimes the virus does not cause a serious illness (heavier than influenza) in the local population, with whom it has \"cohabited\" for a long time, but will be deadly for visitors.\nSo it was with yellow fever, \"jumping\" over people through mosquitoes from other species of primates in Africa, mortally dangerous to Europeans, but relatively safe for Africans in places where this disease is common.\nChina is a place where there are many species of mammals that are close to us humans in temperature. In the case of 2019-nCoV, bats were such a reservoir species, they also served as a source of closely related coronavirus, which caused SARS.\nOther places in the world do not fit well. India has less diversity of mammalian species that can relatively easily infect humans. In Africa, diversity is even greater, but population density is lower than Chinese and there are no means of quickly moving huge masses of people.\nRecall: the 2019-nCoV flash came on the eve of the Chinese New Year, when hundreds of millions of Chinese are rapidly moving around the country in high-speed trains, which are more there than in any other part of the world.\nAs we can see, China has created ideal conditions for the emergence of new viral infections. Of course, this helps exotic tastes of local residents, for some reason eating bats. But a little: the main factor here is precisely the wide variety of sources of new viruses and excellent long-distance mass transport, which simplifies the spread of infection.\nHow will the virus respond in life?\nWe have already noted above: epidemiologically, 2019-nCoV is moderately dangerous. Mortality of 2.35% with a basic “infectivity index” of 2.5 is more likely to be SARS (less than a thousand victims) or the Middle East respiratory syndrome 2012-2018 (two thousand victims) than the flu. Recall: in the world tens of millions of people are infected with it per year, at least a quarter of a million die every year from its complications.\nBut from an economic point of view, the coronavirus will definitely cause - and has already caused) big problems. The fact is that China is the largest economy in the world, a quarter-plus more than the US economy. Twenty percent of the world PPP GDP is China, which means that even small, temporary, but rather sharp fluctuations there can noticeably affect the world as a whole.\nThis is especially important now, in the era of the impact of stock exchanges on the real economy. One significant blow to the nerves of brokers and stockholders is that they can create an exchange panic, which in itself can trigger a recession in the real sector of the economy.\nMeanwhile, the reasons for such a panic are already there. During the Chinese New Year, the population spends much more than usual - more than ours in the New Year period (the situation is similar to China in the USA for Christmas). This year, the surge in consumption was far from so strong. Wuhan was closed, the metro was stopped there, the movement of people between cities (domestic tourism in China is the most popular) went down sharply.\nTourism gives the Chinese economy a lot for a trillion dollars a year. The system of quarantines and recommendations for restricting movement can last until the end of the epidemic - and this, according to past experience with SARS, up to a couple of years. That is, we are talking about losses of hundreds of billions of dollars a year or even more.\nSqueezing consumer activity due to less visits to restaurants and public places can be no less dangerous. China is a major importer of energy, food and much more. The recession in this economy is capable of launching a cascade of compression around the world.\nAnd the exchanges have already reacted. Asian and European over the past day fell by 2%, in the US - by 1.5%. It is likely that Donald Trump, who has an election this year, will try to rectify the situation. States are able to pump markets with money and prevent a crisis. However, noticeable nervousness in the global economy is likely to persist for many months. And even those countries that the epidemic does not directly affect will feel this.\nUPD The article is supplemented in connection with new information.\nPopular\nA constant describing the interaction of matter with electromagnetic radiation may not be a constant at all.\nThe US Department of Defense, after careful analysis, decided to officially publish a video with allegedly captured unidentified flying objects. According to the military, such a \"transparency policy\" is intended to \"clarify any misconceptions to the public about whether these cadres are real,\" which had already leaked to the Network. However, the department did not provide an explanation for this.\nHalf-quarantine in Russia or the USA is still half-effective, and there will be no vaccine for months to come. Therefore, many have hopes for the coming summer: other coronaviruses in the summer, for unknown reasons, are retreating. What does the experience of hot countries say on this subject, which, oddly enough, is difficult to attribute to Ecuador with its corpses on the streets? While it looks rather positive: it seems that hot countries really suffer from the pandemic least of all. Nevertheless, there is very little hope that the summer heat will help Russia in particular. Let's try to figure out why.\nIf today, for example, you are 30 years old, then the planet’s population has twice “added” another billion to your life. When you were ten years old in 1999, the world's population reached six billion. In 2011, when you turned 22 years old, the bar of seven billion people was overcome. Today we are 7.7 billion. What will happen when another 30 years pass? According to UN estimates, after five years, if the population growth dynamics does not undergo dramatic changes, an eight-billionth resident will appear on the planet. And then what? Overpopulation, lack of water and food, not to mention other resources, and waves of refugees? Or is everything really not so scary?\nThe mask is versatile.

The media is flooding us with reports of many coronavirus deaths. Primary Adamkova claims that we miscalculate coronavirus victims. How to interpret the whole matter? Does coronavirus have undeserved PR?\nMUDr. Jaroslav Dvořák: In the current flu season (2019/2020), a total of 267 clinically serious cases of influenza infection requiring hospitalization in the intensive care regime were reported by last Friday, ie 6 March 2020, of which 55 people succumbed to the infection.\nOn average in the Czech Republic, approximately 1,500 people die of the “usual” flu a year. I repeat, people are more likely to die from the complications that the flu causes… It also depends on the severity of a particular flu epidemic. The situation is similar in other developed countries.\nYou got tested for coronavirus. Why? What is the result? When does it make sense to do it?\nYes, I was tested - because I come into contact with patients who may be carriers of the virus. I have chronic non-infectious lung problems without fever, fortunately I have been tested for coronavirus with a negative result.\nI worked until mid-March. Then we switched to an online regime with only health and life-threatening conditions, with chronic patients having to be postponed. We send medicines via e-prescriptions. It is also because the state has supplied us with supplies of drapes and respirators for three days, and thanks to my good patients, I have enough drapes that do not match the effectiveness of those made of nanofibers.\nI have unconfirmed information from general practitioners that the supplied drapes and respirators from Chinese supplies have expired (expiration 2009 and 2006, respectively). These are veils that were supposed to be discarded some 14 years ago. It is said that other states returned them, only the Czech Republic bought these used veils… (According to some sources, see the Benešov daily, there is a possible error in the incorrectly read code of the batch sent by our paramedics, not in the respirators themselves, note cars.)\nHow fast is it possible to get tested?\nPerhaps it will speed up - the crisis staff and the government are trying to provide as many tests as possible to protest as many people as possible. Now citizens who have fever, difficulty breathing and cough, get to test immediately, respectively. within 3 days at the latest. I don't have current data right now.\nHow to interpret WHO numbers on coronavirus infections?\nIf we compare coronavirus data with available data from previous years regarding TB, measles and \"common\" influenza, we still do not see any dizzying numbers. Yes, we may be wrong, but I listened to the video on the List, where MUDr. Adamkova. It seems reasonable to me that coronavirus probably enjoys undeserved PR and that there will come a time, perhaps sooner, when coronavirus data will fall into general statistics and the virus will lose its \"popularity\"…\nThanks for the interview.\nIn conclusion: The Sputnik reporter wrote a question to Dr. Adamkova by e-mail as to whether she correctly understood her opinion on the numbers of deaths at COVID-19.

In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.\nIs the virus a biological weapon?\nA former member of the United Nations Commission on Biological Weapons, Igor Nikulin, believes that the emergence of this virus could be the result of the use of an American biological weapon. He mentioned the scandal in 2010, when one of the 400 American military biological laboratories deployed around the world was closed in Indonesia because it was conducting secret experiments with the bird flu virus. When the virus emerged from the laboratory and a serious pandemic began, the United States refused to provide information about its work to the Indonesian Ministry of Health.\nHealth officials around the world are racing to control the virus, which first appeared last month, similar to the SARS virus, and the World Health Organization is expected to announce later today whether the spread of the new disease warrants a declaration of an emergency, which relates to complex cross-border epidemics.\nThe vaccine against the virus\nIn less than a week, virologists from the Novosibirsk State Scientific Center \"Victor\" developed a diagnostic test system for Corona virus, which would allow detection of the virus at an early stage of the disease.\nBut it is too early to talk about the development of a vaccine. State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin has asked the State Duma Health Protection Committee to prepare anti-virus measures in the country.\nAmong the measures taken, all travelers arriving from Southeast Asia are examined by thermal imaging at the airports. Hospitals in the Amur region are on high alert. Likewise, preventive measures are being taken across the country - especially in large transport centers. In particular, quarantine control at checkpoints at state borders has been strengthened, and the epidemiological situation is monitored daily.\nRussian Consumer Protection Agency, Ross Potter Nadzor, said that the specialists of the \"Victor\" Center (within the organization) devised tools for the laboratory diagnosis of the new disease.\nScientists from Novosibirsk developed two independent diagnostic groups, based on the method used in molecular biology and the chain polymerase reaction. Using one of these methods, the 2019-nCoV virus can be detected at an early stage, and the second is used to diagnose another serious disease that humanity has encountered before is SARS. The polymerase chain reaction method is very sensitive: it can even detect individual copies of viruses in only 2-4 hours. For this, a small swab of the nasopharynx is sufficient. Thus, rapid diagnosis can be made immediately in the laboratories of the Russian Epidemiology Centers of the Russian Consumer Protection Agency located throughout the country.\nIt is reported that \"Victor\" is one of the largest scientific centers in virology and biotechnology in Russia and the world. Here, one of the first test systems was developed to diagnose HIV and hepatitis B, the immunostimulating drug \"ridustine\" and many other unique medicines.\n\"It is impossible to develop a vaccine within a week, and the evaluation of efficacy also takes time,\" Gennady Onishchenko, a deputy to the Doss Authority, Ross Potribe Nadzor, told the Tsargrad website. This is the seventh version of the Corona virus known to mankind since 1965. Our country has not yet used a vaccine against it, and we must understand that different viral diseases require total or regional vaccination only in the event of a disease. In this case, there is no such need. ”\nHe added that Wuhan is not far from us, the city is closer than it seems to many. Here we talk about an acute respiratory infection that is easy to transmit.

As Thomas Piketty has conclusively shown, inequality always depends on ideology.\nWe are immersed in a vicious intelligence war.

The only possible move of the \"indispensable nation\" on the chessboard of the New Great Game, considering that the United States cannot win a conventional war against China, and cannot win a nuclear war against China.\nA weapon of biological warfare?\nOn the surface, the coronavirus is a biological dream weapon for those obsessed with wreaking havoc in China and praying for regime change.\nHowever, it is complicated. This report is a decent effort trying to trace the origins of the coronavirus. Now compare it with the ideas of Dr. Francis Boyle, professor of international law at the University of Illinois and author, among others, of Biowarfare and Terrorism. He is the man who drafted the 1989 United States Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act, enacted by George HW Bush.\nDr. Boyle is convinced that the coronavirus is a\n\"Offensive biological warfare weapon\" dropped from Wuhan BSL-4 laboratory, though he \"does not say it was done deliberately.\"\nDr. Boyle adds: “All these BSL-4 laboratories in the United States, Europe, Russia, China and Israel are there to research, develop and test biological warfare agents. There really is no legitimate scientific reason to have BSL-4 labs. \" His own research led to a whopping $ 100 billion, by 2015, spent by the United States government on biowar research: \"We have over 13,000 suspected life science scientists ... testing biological weapons here in the United States. . This actually goes back to and even predates 9/11. '\nDr. Boyle directly accuses the \"Chinese government under Xi and his comrades\" of covering up \"from the beginning.\" The first reported case was on December 1, so they had been sitting on this until they could no longer. And all they are telling you is a lie. It is propaganda «.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), for Dr. Boyle, also participates: \"They have approved many of these BSL-4 laboratories (...) I cannot trust anything the WHO says because they were all bought and paid for by Big Pharma and they collude with the CDC, which is the United States government, collude with Fort Detrick. \" Fort Detrick, now a state-of-the-art biowar laboratory, was previously a notorious CIA mind control \"experiment\".\nBuilding on decades of biowar research, the US Deep State. USA You are fully familiar with all biological weapon harmonics. From Dresden, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki to Korea, Vietnam, and Fallujah, the historical record shows that the United States government does not blink when it comes to unleashing weapons of mass destruction against innocent civilians.\nFor its part, the Pentagon Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) has spent a fortune researching bats, coronaviruses, and gene-editing biological weapons. Now conveniently, as if it were a form of divine intervention, DARPA's \"strategic allies\" have been chosen to develop a genetic vaccine.\nThe 1996 neocon Bible, The Project for a New American Century (PNAC), stated unequivocally, \"Advanced forms of biological warfare that can\" attack \"specific genotypes can transform biological warfare from the reign of terror into a politically useful tool.\"\nThere is no doubt that the coronavirus, thus far, has been a politically useful, heaven-sent tool that achieves, with minimal investment, the desired goals of maximized global US power. USA with its semi-paralyzed economy.\nHowever, the perspective is in order. The CDC estimated that up to 42.9 million people became ill during the 2018-2019 flu season in the U.S. USA Not less than 647,000 people were hospitalized. And 61,200 died.\nIt is up to Chinese virologists to decode its possibly synthetic origin. China's reaction, depending on the findings, will have devastating consequences, literally.\nSetting the stage for the raging twenties\nAfter successfully redirecting trade supply chains across Eurasia for their own benefit and hollowing out the Heartland, subordinate American and Western elites are now looking at a vacuum. And the emptiness returns his gaze. A \"West\" ruled by the United States now faces irrelevance. BRI is in the process of reversing at least two centuries of western dominance.\nThere is no way that the West and especially the US \"system leader\" allow it. It all started with dirty operations that created problems on the periphery of Eurasia, from Ukraine to Syria and Myanmar.\nNow is when things really get difficult. The targeted assassination of Major General Soleimani plus the coronavirus, the Wuhan Flu, has really set the stage for the furious 1920s.

The church itself does not confirm this, but the information about the UOC as the “epicenter of the coronavirus” was personally carried by President Zelensky in the next video addressing the frightened nation.\n“A new stream of horror stories and delirium from ZE. In particular, that the peak of the coronavirus epidemic will occur on the 20th of April, so do not go anywhere on Easter. Look how the church is hindering the horned one, ”commented political analyst Dmitry Korneychuk. He drew attention to the fact that no one was touching the “Tomos Church” of Pyotr Alekseevich and the PCU was confidently seizing new areas, demonstrating complete disregard for anti-virus measures.\nFor example, in shops and bakeries, priests from the PTsU Epiphanius actively sprinkle Easter water with holy water, and this promulgated fact already revolts believers. Moreover, both the sprinkles and the clothes of the priests of the PCU abound in patriotic yellow-blue tones. “Let them sprinkle what they want in their church, but what right do they have in the store?”, The buyers are indignant.\nIn addition, on its official website, the PCU shamelessly publishes videos of the service, during which Epiphanius and other clergy defiantly violate sanitary standards during quarantine. The restrictions imposed by state authorities, as it turned out, do not apply to Tomos carriers. There were only 5 photographers and videographers in the temple, although their presence was not obligatory during the service. Another 25 believers who attended the Divine Liturgy on the occasion of Palm Sunday fell into the frame. But sanitary standards allow you to stay in the room only ten. But this law was not written for the CEC, therefore, two choirs (female and male) also took part in the liturgy, which totals more than 30 people.\nIt is noteworthy that Epiphanius not only violates the norms of quarantine measures, but also shows this to the whole country. And no one punishes him, and does not threaten to hammer the doors of the temple with boards - as the mayor of the Dnieper Filatov does. For some reason, they don’t find shells and other explosives in temples of the PTsU, and Vyatrovich sees “nurseries of coronavirus” exclusively in canonical Orthodox churches. “And because the CSP is an enterprise, like the Epicenter or Roshen, and you can work with them,” parishioners comment on the situation.\nFollow us on Yandex Zen\nSUPPORT THE PROJECT"}, {"url": "https://journal-neo.org/2020/03/16/is-covid-19-devouring-what-s-left-of-the-trump-presidency/", "title": "Is COVID-19 Devouring What’s Left of the Trump Presidency?", "text": "Does anyone remember the scene in the original film Jaws in 1975 when Captain Quint gets devoured by the shark? Well, the COVID-19 situation in the US makes me imagine Donald Trump being devoured by a gigantic coronavirus. Or perhaps, the shark’s role could be played by western mainstream media? Either way, there is some Trump munching going on. Whatever Hollywood special effect you apply, the Trump presidency is over. Hey, by the way, did Joe Biden engineer the SARS-CoV-2?\nRemembering then-Vice President Joe Biden from the days of the Ukraine coup d’é·ta, most truthtellers would not put it past old 1-percent Joe. But no matter how COVID-19 came about, Trump is just not going to be able to “Tweet” himself out of his most recent screwups. It’s a funny thing about Americans, they can be as gullible as they come, but once they catch on… And boy are they about to catch on. I almost feel sorry for the bad boy they once called The King of Debt, but Donald Trump had it coming. Now, an article on Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post by columnist Eugene Robinson, does not seem so mean and cruel in portraying Trump’s support base as the stupidest, most gullible people on earth..\nRobinson, who’s not exactly my favorite expert, aptly pointed out The Donald promised his supporters he’d build a 2,000 mile-long wall on the US – Mexico border, and then bill Mexico for it. But “not a single mile of Trump’s wall has been built,” according to Robinson. However, in fairness to the president, a half a mile of the wall has been built by a private organization called We Build the Wall on private property near El Paso, Texas, with Trump’s encouragement. Check it yourself, if you doubt me here.\nI don’t want to drag the reader into this mess. Some good people have donated a lot of time and money to help create this Tower of Babel. Trump’s other lies are more damnable, anyway. Take Robinson’s assertions about Trump’s promises on America’s imbalance of trade. “The Chosen One” (another Trump nickname) told his supporters he’d reverse trade policies that helped other nations and hurt Americans. Robinson wrote:\n“The Commerce Department announced Wednesday that the overall US trade deficit in goods last year soared to an all-time high of $891 billion. The deficit with China, Trump’s principal target — the amount by which the value of imported goods exceeded the value of exported goods — reached a record $419 billion.”\nThen there’s “Draining the Swamp”, affordable care, and a laundry list of other Trump promises that have gone unfulfilled. But none of Donald Trump’s follies would have even been remembered has he not screwed the pooch on COVID-19. In this one, the emotional escapism Americans get to relish in because of what was Trump’s New York bravado in a booming economy is about to hit everybody’s next-door neighbor. The Wall Street bubble is about to become a vacuum. The world pandemic is going to suck the life out of the American people when the US Treasury is forced to print more borrowed money just to keep the world afloat. And make no mistake, that’s the economic future if we are to escape Mad Max and Thunderdome replacing next year’s Super Bowl.\nAs horrible as total bankruptcy sounds, the human cost of America’s unpreparedness for the coronavirus is already unbelievable. How many reading this remember the time when the world looked to the United States for vaccines, healing-aid, and outreach to stem the miseries of other nations? And in America, Trump swore he had “shut down” the coronavirus back in early February 2020. I did run across a Trump Tweet early on in the fight to stop COVID-19.\n“The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”\nThroughout the crisis up until he was caught lying about the availability of coronavirus tests a few days ago. Before he announced flight bans on Europe, Trump has bragged and spewed like his comment; “The CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus…” The American president is unveiled as a man who does not even care to study the issues and facts surrounding him. Now New York City officials say New Yorkers should consider themselves to have been exposed to the coronavirus. How’s that for under control?\nI almost feel bad saying that President Trump is the worst kind of incompetent, but even his most stalwart fan base is beginning to see through the bullshit. And as he continues to babble like an idiot about his “good job, good job, good job” Trump manages to use a deadly disease to plug his failed border wall fiasco:\n“Going up fast. We need the Wall more than ever!” – President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump\nMeanwhile, the 2018 promises by Trump to fund Italy’s debt seem to be paying off, interestingly, as the entire country will probably be up for sale shortly. Italy leaders are already planning a moratorium to get more investment to float the country’s burgeoning debt made worse by the coronavirus. And, it’s no surprise that (hey, isn’t she a crook) Christine Lagarde (Bernard Tapie’s loan guarantor), who’s now the President of the European Central Bank, told the Italians they were “pretty much on their own” the other day. Bond yields went through the roof because the ECB is not going to help Italy. This means mortgage rates on Italian homes etc, are going to be unpayable for many Italians. And when they lose their properties, guess who will move in to snap them up? Say “billionaires” softly. Allianz Global Investors is already snapping up Italian bonds like they are mint chocolates on a Waldorf pillow.\nAround the world, the Norwegians are closing all airports and seaports. The Saudis have grounded all air carriers. Global tourism accounts for 320 million jobs and more than $9 trillion dollars of the global economy. Here in Europe, Multinational travel and tourism company TUI Group is on target to follow rival tours company, Thomas Cook down the tubes. The COVID-19 pandemic has already caused the German company to postpone pre-payments hoteliers depend on to stay afloat and to cancel outright contracts. TUI stocks suck for the last five years anyhow and the company now has limited options to cover dividends and its burgeoning debt. TUI shares have fallen by 42% year-to-date. Investors who were once sedated with juicy dividends are worried now that travel demand hit by coronavirus will crash the company. Underneath, the hotels, restaurants, retailers, wholesalers fear utter devastation. And at the White House, the news is good – President Donald Trump tested negative for the coronavirus!\nThe whole mess stinks of a genetically engineered, secret germ warfare 007 placed super-virus designed to let those with money take over what’s left of the world. Opps! I did not mean to insert that here. It just slipped out in the middle of all this Trump over truth. Aha! And maybe I got it! Maybe the reshaping of the world is the crescendo of Donald Trump’s purpose in the first place? It is probably time for him to leave. Now wouldn’t that make all of us feel gullible and stupid?

Contrary to what happened in World War II and the Cold War, these forces that are currently competing against the idea of democracy and liberalism do not have a common leadership but they come from your Different and have different ideologies common denominator among them is the hostility to the idea of liberal democracy, acting out of humiliation practiced by the West and damaged their prestige.\nChina's foreign policy:\nChinese President Xi Jinping is a representative of the competing forces for the world order, calling for the erasure of the insult to China by Western colonialism in the mid-nineteenth century, and striving to restore China to its advanced global position, and China defies liberal Western democracy as a model of governance in The world through the presentation of another model of government, which is “capitalist tyranny”, i.e. a central economy alongside a free market economy, massive supervision over it and penetration through technology, and the suppression of minorities and opponents of the system. Provided for free to citizens. The tendency of the Chinese authoritarian capitalist system to become the largest economy in the world, as it invests in various ways trillions of dollars in dozens of countries through the Belt and Road Project, which is a \"continental belt of infrastructure created on the Maritime Silk Road to attract European, Asian and African investments\", where China is working to push the United States of America outside the Pacific / India, and is working to change the world order and international institutions that have been adapted to serve the goals of the United States after World War II, and despite this, China does not seek to D. The United States as the world's leading country, due mainly to its implications in terms of liability and economic burden.\nRussia's foreign policy:\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is another representative of the competing powers on the world stage, who seeks to restore the glory of Tsarist Russia and its place in history on the international stage. And American domination after the end of the Cold War was an anomaly that allowed the United States to activate a number of measures and tools (military intervention, sanctions, information war) to advance its interests at the expense of other players in the international arena - especially at the expense of Russia - so Russia is working to change this reality and restore A situation that you consider appropriate for it as a global power. Putin is fully aware that Russia is unable to compete economically with the United States and China, and therefore calls for the creation of a \"multipolar\" world in which Russia as one of the great powers of concessions recognize its influence.\nThe Middle East, Arab Spring Revolutions, and Civil Conflicts:\nThe turmoil in the Middle East continues, with prominent authoritarian leaders, including Abdelaziz Bouteflika (Algeria) and Omar al-Bashir (Sudan), overthrown by the region’s economic system (youth unemployment, corruption, shadow economics, and social inequality). Economic, and dependence on oil) in addition to the struggle for identity (religious, sectarian, and tribal) that has not been resolved since 2011, the presidents of Egypt, Yemen, and Libya were also overthrown in the first wave of unrest in 2011, and in Syria that started protests in 2011 the unrest led to War ignition oh A bloody twist, which led to Bashar al-Assad remaining in power, despite the great support from Iran, Hezbollah and Russia, but his survival was possible because the Syrians concluded that his dictatorial rule was better than the chaos created by the war and the alternative to radical Islam. The situation in Libya is also turbulent between the Libyan army and the reconciliation government, with the exception of Egypt, which was able to emerge from the Arab Spring crisis with the least possible losses.\nThe analytical narration of the global system:\nThe competing forces agree on the world order, on the point of view related to the fragility of the liberal Western democracies and their structural weaknesses, and this was demonstrated by the loss suffered by both sides, where the difficulty of dealing with long-term wars, and the restrictions resulting from the war strategy adopted by the West that relied on technology Advanced. Now the 21st century is transformed into a large global group of ideologies, where opponents of the idea of liberal democracy emphasize the centrality of the nation-state, which has sovereignty over its institutions, controls international arrangements and deals more with the affairs of their countries by following what is happening outside their borders, in contrast to communism and fascism, who They do not propose a global ideological idea such as “freedom” and “equality” that should contribute to the guidance of all citizens of the world, and they also understand that the 21st century economy that globalization has contributed to does not allow the isolation of countries even if they are very strong in economic aspects And technology, so some countries are defined as a sovereign nation with a unique identity, and according to this idea each country will respect the identity and sovereignty of its neighbors so that they can live with each other in peace\nCovid-19 virus (Corona) between natural appearance and artificial synthesis:\nAfter the advent of Virus Covid-19, everyone asked whether this virus was created, that is, it was made by humans, or was it the result of human interaction with nature and its violation of the laws of conformity that God created it. In both cases, this virus represents a major transformation on all international economic, political and humanitarian tracks as well. Corona viruses are a large group of viruses that cause illnesses that vary between colds and more severe diseases, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The emerging corona virus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. Corona viruses are an animal source, which means that they are transmitted between animals and humans. Extensive investigations have found that the Corona virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has moved from the butter hooks to humans, while the Corona virus that causes respiratory syndrome in the Middle East has moved from one-humped camel to humans. Many known coronaviruses are spread among animals, and have not yet infected humans. Common symptoms of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection may cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.\nCovid-19 biological weapon other than the global economic map:\nSino-American Conflict:\nSome political thinkers such as Frenchman (Jacques Attali) predicted that 2019 will be the year of confrontation between China and the United States - American President Trump announced a one-sided trade war against China, and China later interacted with this war. The truth is that the conflict between the United States and China is an international struggle and not a conflict of nations, it transcends the struggle for the extension of influence, economy and control to the stage of a conflict of ideas, concepts, approaches and mechanisms. The logic of power here is different. About myself to achieve peace and not war, so I worked on developing the products of artificial intelligence and developing its electronic defense capabilities and entering the world of space control. Below we review the features of this conflict:\nÂ € رئيس The President of the Brazilian World Trade Organization, Roberto Azevedo pointed out that there are strong indications of a trade war between the United States and China. Azevedo said in the same interview that the future of the economic world will be bleak in the event of such a war, and at the same pace the American-Chinese trade conflict is growing day by day. This conflict has entered sensitive stages, whether in terms of increasing the volume of customs duties imposed by the two parties or through the expansion and diversification of economic fields targeted by the governments of the two countries with these fees. This situation confused the global market, where many economists expected a recession Mai because of the trade tension between the poles of the world economy, has increased these concerns, calls cascading from the European Union need to resolve outstanding trade problems between China and the United States urgently as growing this conflict and expansion threatens the global economy, a violent crisis, some of its features began sweeping the world. This article highlights developments in the US-China trade conflict and its implications for the global economy.\nÂ € الصينية Chinese exports to the United States - the largest market for Chinese products - fell by 16% to 44.4 billion dollars under pressure from the punitive tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump in his battle to curb Beijing's expansionist ambitions. Despite the continuation of negotiations between Washington and Beijing, the tariff war is still raging. The value of American tariffs on Chinese products has reached 360 billion dollars, while the value of Chinese tariffs on American products has reached 110 billion dollars.\n• In August 2019, US President Donald Trump issued a \"enforceable order\" for US companies to leave China after Beijing announced tariffs on US goods and products and Trump pledged to respond to Beijing after Chinese authorities unveiled a plan to impose a 10 percent tariff on goods And American products worth up to 75 billion dollars annually.\nTrump tweeted on Twitter, saying: \"We don't want China, and frankly, we'd be much better without them.\" He added: \"Our country has stupidly lost trillions of dollars while dealing with China over several years. They stole our intellectual property rights, which are estimated at hundreds of billions annually. They want to continue to do so, but I will not allow them.\"\nThe New Krona and the Decision Theory:\nZhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, has announced that there is evidence that the CIA has spread the Corona virus in China. The Chinese diplomat pointed out that there is evidence confirming that the COVID-19 virus was created by American scientists in 2015. It is reported that the United States provided China with all the information it possesses about the emerging corona virus. Chinese experts have discovered in the archive an article published in 2015 in the journal Nature Medicine, confirming that US scientists have been able to obtain a new type of corona virus, which has a direct impact on humans. The truth, if we follow the following points, the truth will be revealed to us where:\n1- If we look at the timing of its spread, which coincides with the signing of the first phase of the trade agreement between the United States and China, regarding their differences that surfaced since the rise of US President Donald Trump to the White House 3 years ago, given that the trade imbalance between The two countries, from the American point of view, are mainly due to Chinese manipulation, whether in its currency, or by offering products made with less quality materials than their American counterparts, and therefore can be sold at cheaper prices, and dumping the American market at the expense of the American product. Here we can say that the spread of dangerous prey in China is considered a decisive stage in the US-China conflict, as it provides additional points for Washington in its trade conflict with Beijing, through more expected American measures towards everything that comes from China, whether from persons or The products, on the pretext of fears of an outbreak of the disease among American citizens, and thus reneging on Washington's obligations despite reaching an initial agreement, open the door to a new round of negotiations between the two sides.\n2- Perhaps talking about the new round of negotiations between Washington and Beijing represents great concerns for many followers, in light of great expectations revolving mostly around its difficulty, given the many controversial issues, especially regarding the issue of the real value of the Chinese currency (the yuan), as the states The United States accuses the Chinese government of manipulating the value of its currency and keeping it at a value less than its real value, which enables it to invade the global markets, at the heart of which is the American market, and therefore the murderous virus remains an American opportunity to impose more pressure during negotiations with Chinese officials to force them to provide more Of concessions.\n3- Beyond the direct differences between Washington and China, the spread of Corona represents a good opportunity for the United States to regain a great deal of its economic position, as the dominant powers in the world, after Beijing managed to destabilize the American economic throne for many years, in light of the current crisis that may lead to Decline in Chinese economic growth, while Washington has achieved tangible economic growth since the beginning of the Trump era, which is partly due to the encouragement of American products, through the imposition of protective measures on imports from abroad, both from allied countries, especially the countries of the Union European Japan or South Korea, or opponents, led by China.\n4- It seems that the proliferation crisis \"Corona\" carries with it a grant to US President Donald Trump, to achieve more gains, through which he can promote a new victory, that lies in his success in restoring American power and its political and economic domination, before the American citizen, to announce, before The start of the American elections scheduled for next November, he promised to \"make America great again\", and he eventually fulfilled at all levels.\nCorona and the transformations of the global system:\nThe global system in its many forms is on the brink of collapse, as the capitalist financial system and its consequences from the freedom of trade and monopolies can no longer continue in light of the transformations taking place in the world and the state of closure experienced by countries. This system may be the first victim of corona in the coming months, after countries started removing money from their cash reserves to cover the large losses suffered by companies, large and small alike. The closure is no longer restricted to humans, and even to many goods, after scientific studies have proven that the virus circulates on surfaces, and it can remain on them for 24 hours, which means that it can enter through the goods and not only humans. Globalization as a system that the Americans viewed a lot, and adopted it in the face of the former Soviet Union, is on the way to extinction. The world is no longer a small village, and the lexis and olive tree, according to what Thomas Friedman adopted in his simplification of globalization, can no longer meet. The world today has become closed villages to itself, trying to rely on what it has to stand up to the emerging virus. The matter may vary between countries, according to the criteria for progress, but it will be more difficult for one country than the other. Until now, we have not seen the effect of the virus on global policies, and the interference in the countries that prevailed before the virus spread, but it will undoubtedly have an effect in the coming days, after the state of retreat that countries took, and their attempt to survive only in the face of the global pandemic. Few are to date inter-state solidarity initiatives, after most countries are in need of assistance to some extent, especially those that essentially live in a difficult economic situation. The global isolation today is based on the Western countries and the Middle East, after it was the beginning in China and the countries of East Asia, which it says managed to confront the pandemic and overcome it. However, the lack of transparency of many governments in that region, especially China, raises doubts about the reality of the successive announcements of declining casualties, and whether they were actual or an attempt to save the country from the collapse that it reached due to the stoppage of industries and exports. This keeps the state of suspicion from Western countries about the Chinese measures and prevents the return of commercial traffic with them to what it was.\nIf the current global closure is on the way to escalation, and the countries that did not take such measures seem to go to them in the coming days, despite the economic risks that may result from them, but there are no longer many options in the confrontation, this virus that cannot be seen by eye The abstract, imposed an unprecedented siege on the world, and is on his way to overthrow the world order, pending the appearance of the features of any alternative system that will replace him.\nReferences:\n1- The World Health Organization - Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean\n2- Bbc Arabic News\n3- Basho Ramzy - Corona \".. the decisive point in the trade war between America and China - Al-Youm El-Sabaa newspaper\n4- James Jeffrey - Trump's National Security Strategy: A Return to the Nineteenth Century?

While the grassroots fire broke out in the Qing empire, embraced by the turmoil and turmoil, the world did not care about him, but by 1893 the plague appeared in the port cities of China and from there - in the holds of merchant ships - it began its next triumphal march around the world.\nIndia is the pearl of the British Empire. Thirty years have passed since the sepoy uprising, when the fierce anger of a popular rebellion was breaking on the stamina of soldiers in red uniforms, and now the Empire rules these lands with a heavy hand, to the mutual prosperity of local tribes and their distant rulers. The British busily equip the country for themselves, laying thousands of kilometers of railways, laying mines and equipping fields. Tea and jute are grown in Assam, jute and opium are grown in Bengal, cotton is used in Punjab, and many ships go from India to Albion with a load of rice, tea, wheat and spices to bring industrial goods on the way back. This is English mercantilism, this is the most capitalist country and the most colonial colony during the heyday of this, that's all, and the British earn about a hundred million pounds sterling annually on this move.\nThe gentlemen from ICS, the Indian Civil Service, know their job very well, but do they really know all those nations that hate and despise each other since Brahma created this earth? Hardly. How can you know them if in Allahabad someone is ordained in Sat Bhai, if the Sansi people sing the song of a lizard, and in Jadahri they paint the death bull - which no Englishman should even see? When does such a deep gulf separate Hindus and Muslims, Chamars and Fakirs, and when a huge number of religious and cultural contradictions are united only by a common dislike for Europeans?\nThis is a huge, many-sided, magical country of poor shacks and golden palaces, incredible customs and the first sprouts of national education, wild jungle and overpopulated cities.\nThe scene is Bombay, the largest seaport on the coast of India, a rapidly growing city, an intricate labyrinth of slums, the inhabitants of which serve the transshipment of colonial goods from the railway junction of the city to ships and then to the metropolis. Under the direction of the British East India Company, the fishing village archipelago has become a huge commercial center, and people in European dresses and European faces swim in the many-voiced native rivers, and the majestic quarters of British architecture rise proud islands in the seas of poor shacks. Dozens of ships in the port are surrounded by a highly organized round-the-clock vanity of loading and unloading goods, time is money. Ships also come from Hong Kong, although trade with it has recently dipped slightly due to some kind of epidemic that has appeared in those parts.\nCarpet weaving\nI hope you caught the right mood.\nPlague boys, drove.\n... rats began to come out in groups to the light and hebit heaped. Of all the sheds, cellars, cellars, gutters, they crawled out in long, relaxed lines, taking the wrong steps to the light so that, circling around their own axis, they would die closer to the person. At night in the alleys, on the stairwells, their short dying squeak was distinctly heard.\nAlbert Camus\nThe ancient sacred poem of Bhagavad Purana in Sanskrit language instructed the inhabitants of Hindustan to leave their homes as soon as the rats began to fall from the roofs and die. Cooley - hired porters who worked for beggarly rations in the port of Bombay in August 1896, could not follow the wise advice of the ancient book, because they had nowhere to run, and hungry families were waiting for them in their dwellings. Every morning, people who went to work found more and more corpses of dead rats, and gradually the bodies of dead people began to be found among them. The first deaths from the plague among the port poor began around mid-August, but only at the end of September did the problem take on a scale sufficient for the city authorities to convene an emergency meeting. They listened to the chief medical officer of the city: many of the deceased, found by the police, were found characteristic buboes under the armpits, in the groin or neck. The first desire of a normal official belonging to any country and era is to “control the situation and prevent panic”, therefore, as part of the “control and prevention”, it was decided that nothing special was happening in the city, and “the plague exists in a mild, recognizable form only using microscopic analysis. \" Meanwhile, a relatively harmless dozen sick people a day gradually turned into a menacing hundred sick people a day.\nSomeone Solomon Iji, impersonating a saint, announced the approach of the fateful date by the Magasts, with whom the supposedly golden millennium would begin. By this time, the world with the help of the plague will be cleansed of all sinners and arbiters of lawlessness. People were worried.\nA year and a half before the epidemic, unknown attackers stained with a tar a statue of Queen Victoria in one of the squares of Bombay - and this could not go unpunished. When the plague appeared, at the bazaars at the same time there was a belief that this disaster was sent by an angry queen-goddess in revenge to all the peoples of India. People were very worried.\nIn early October, a special committee was set up of officials and doctors with the broadest powers. General Gaiter was appointed head of the anti-plague committee. The hereditary military man, who had served in India all his life, who fought in Pakistan and Burma, knew the customs, he became a good personnel choice, especially since the army and navy units from the garrison of the city were at the disposal of the anti-plague committee. Heiter had just returned to Bombay from an expedition to Chitral - a small, formally independent principality in the highlands of North India, where the operation to project British influence did not go according to plan, turning into a short but brutal war with the Pashtuns.\nThe committee launched a thorough and massive campaign to clean the city, and local residents organized into work teams washed the gutters and streets with a mixture of sea water and carbolic acid, sprinkled with street disinfectant street intersections and apartment buildings - more than 100 thousand rupees were spent on disinfection. And of course, we all remember which disinfection is the most reliable, right? Several blocks of urban slums were evicted and committed to cleansing fire. From the apartments of those quarters that it was decided to leave, all the junk that was not pinned to the floor — dresses, rags, bedding and all that — was carried out and burned. The work was greatly facilitated by the fact that in the vast majority of Hindu dwellings there was absolutely no furniture, except for thin wooden partitions that divide one small room into ≈ 30 microscopic family capsules, each of which was a basic “social unit” - one or two workers, the elderly parents, several children, several unemployed, and all are constantly hungry and live in incredible crowding, poverty and unsanitary conditions. The partitions were torn off the floor and burned on the street, the sleeve of a hand pump was brought inside, and floors, walls and ceilings were poured with a solution of carbolic acid. The tiled roof of the roof was dismantled to give access to the sun and fresh air, the stairs were sprinkled with bleach and the house was handed over to the tenured residents.\nAt first it was supposed that ten healthy quarantines should be subjected to all healthy inhabitants of the houses where the plague was diagnosed. From a medical point of view, this was very reasonable, from a logistic point of view, it was very unreasonable, but from a traditionally traditional point of view it was a complete game. It’s impossible to drive the Parsis, Muslims and Hindus under one roof, they must be stored separately. A Muslim woman whose husband has died cannot leave home for four months and another five days, and the first attempts to move such women to quarantine camps led to such a fierce mess in Islamic neighborhoods that they were left alone. With a daily mortality rate of 200-300 people, it would be necessary to isolate a thousand people a day, and taking into account the religious and traditional restrictions, another “quarantine Bombay” of slightly smaller size would have to be built near Bombay. Well, in general, they scored quarantine, let them run around.\nBut then they insulated the sick and suspicious of the plague, destroyed property and sometimes dwellings of people who died of the plague, evacuated people from the affected neighborhoods (to carry out total disinfection, you know), banned fairs and pilgrimages, organized street checkpoints with medical examinations , imposed restrictions on rail passenger transportation and, in principle, on movement around the country, inspected ships and their passengers, and a particularly strict quarantine was imposed for persons sailing to Europe.\nDuring the searches, the locals did not diligently cooperate. A patient or corpse that was found automatically meant that a wild pogrom would be organized in the house, some doctors who were slightly ill or even quite healthy would be taken away somewhere, the walls smeared with smelly, and in general it would be better to stay away from all this. The rumor was extremely widespread that the queen demanded to deliver ten thousand Hindu liver to her, so the people sent from overseas and local doctors took people away and performed autopsies in hospitals.\n“The population by all means tried to hide the patients for fear of transporting them to hospitals ... To hide the sick, relatives went to all sorts of tricks. They were locked in chests, in which they sometimes managed to suffocate while the inspection team was in the house; they hid in the most remote corners of the attics and threw various rubbish. In one case, an old woman dying from a plague was seated facing the window, and her daughter diligently combed her hair while the inspection team examined the premises. ”\nDr. Levin, member of the Russian expedition\nBy December, Bombay no longer looked like a prosperous trading city: mortality at times amounted to two thousand! people a day, on the site of several blocks there were scorched spots, street bazaars were closed, thousands of people were dumped from the city, and tens of thousands tried to dump. The plague for the majority of Bombay residents was not so terrible as a disrupted economic life: the quarantine imposed by the authorities and restrictions on the movement of goods and residents, the stopped work of the port and general panic left tens of thousands of people without livelihoods for whom the daily hard work of moving goods from warehouses on ships and back was the only way not to die of starvation and provide for their families. The city was swept by a wave of robberies and violence, when the hungry and desperate took the last piece of bread from the hungry and exhausted.\nLocals are waiting for a special train for evacuation. British lithography\nUnderstanding that the fleeing residents of Bombay would certainly drag the infection deep into the country, Geiter (the head of the anti-plague commission) ordered that military sanitary barriers be put in advance and preventive measures started. One of these anti-plague \"squads\" was unfolding in the city of Pune, one hundred and fifty kilometers from Bombay, under the leadership of ICS officer Charles Rand. Concentrating under his leadership about five hundred soldiers, several doctors and paramedics, he developed a vigorous defense activity, establishing inspections, house searches, disinfection, and all that sort of thing, and for the locals the situation looked unequivocal.\nThe fact is that in the eyes of local residents, Rand and his doctors first appeared, smearing the houses with a smelly white mixture, and then (along with the refugees from the coast, but this is a coincidence) came a plague, killing their relatives and friends. In February 1897, about seven hundred people died in the city, and they were undoubtedly poisoned by the British. Moreover, (British soldiers) either because of ignorance or insolence mocked, allowed themselves to monkey tricks, said nonsense, intimidated, touched innocent people, shoved them, went into any place for no reason, stole valuable things - quote from a local newspaper.\nThey had every right to invade any house and topple things ... The servicemen stripped men, women and children naked for “checking”, sometimes even in public places, and evacuated them to hospitals or quarantined them. Sometimes they also destroyed property without proper permission.\nNo, well, years, yes.\nThere were persistent rumors that at least two women were raped, and many soldiers urinated !!! for food during house searches. Rand, in turn, indicated in reports that the locals blame the soldiers for the plague, show aggression, hide the sick, and secretly bury the dead. Rand writes about iron discipline among soldiers and medical personnel - one of the leaders of Indian nationalists, journalist Tilak writes in his newspaper that the plague is a lesser evil than the tyranny of the anti-plague committee. The truth must have been somewhere in between.\nAnd here, in general, the young revolutionaries of the Chapekar brothers, the national Indian heroes of the struggle for independence, known and revered in the homeland for the feat they accomplished, come on the scene. Schoolchildren know their names, films are made about them, streets are named after them, and their feat is a vivid, original example of dullness. Three moustached brothers lived, lived friendly and not rich, grandfather went bankrupt and died, father went bankrupt and died, the prospects are foggy, and also the plague and the British. The brothers suddenly bombed.\nRand had to be stopped; he was more evil than the plague. Around midnight on June 22, 1897, celebrations marking the next anniversary of Queen Victoria ended, distinguished guests of the provincial scale drove from the government house to their apartments, hotels and residences. When the carriage with Walter Charles Rand caught up with the ambush that the Avengers had set up on the night road, the eldest of the brothers cried out: it's him! The older and middle brother jumped onto the bandwagon and unloaded their pistols at the passenger. The youngest shot dead Lieutenant Aurst, who was not at all involved in business, but looked very suspicious.\nThe elder brother was handed over to the authorities by two generally left Hindus, also brothers (they have very large families there). For this, the other two avengers-brothers flunked the traitors-brothers, got caught in this matter by the police, and then all three of the avengers-brothers were hanged. At the trial, they said that the regular humiliation that Rand had inflicted on the Indian people forced them to defend the dignity of India.\nPuzzled silence, to be honest.\nRand's death did not change anything in the tactics of the British, and the plague eventually managed to stop. She left, killing about four thousand people from the twelve thousandth population of the city. For several decades, this story was forgotten. After India gained independence, national leaders began to peer into the past, in search of pioneering patriots for history books. The feat of the Chapekar brothers was declared the first sign of the national movement, and canonized.\nInstead of morality, the mustachioed poster of the 2016 Bollywood blockbuster.\nThere are almost no dances in the film, which disappointed me a little, but HEROIC PAPHOS is at the same level as in their films of the 70s\nI change the subject.\n“I have no doubt that the day will come when one of my students will stop the plague”\nLouis Pasteur\nThe third pandemic of the plague was striding across Asia, epidemics had already been encountered in China and the Russian Empire, and the wary medical authorities of developed countries around the world did not want to miss the chance to gain some experience in dealing with the terrible enemy, and it would be better to stay away from their borders. India has become another pilgrimage center for \"microbial hunters\": in addition to British physicians, scientific expeditions from Austria-Hungary, Italy, France, Russia, Egypt and Germany worked there. Microbiology is a young rapidly developing science, and more and more new discoveries suggest that in the first half of the twentieth century the human mind will be able to completely eradicate all diseases. The enthusiasm was incredible.\nPasteur was right. Among those who went to Bombay at the request of the colonial government was thirty-six-year-old microbiologist Vladimir Aaronovich Khavkin, a former subject of the Russian Empire, a former graduate of the Novorossiysk Medical Institute, a former student of Mechnikov, a former employee of the Pasteur Institute of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. In 1893, he created the world's first cholera vaccine and came to Calcutta with it, and over the next four years he personally vaccinated ≈ 42,000 patients. Mortality from cholera fell dozens of times, the vaccine began to be produced on an industrial scale, dozens of specialists were trained - a brilliant victory over the most formidable disease of the 19th century. And now the train takes him to Bombay - to the plague.\nHe arrived in Bombay with a prepared action plan: he proceeded from the well-known prerequisites for preparing immune vaccines: if a weakened culture of microbes is introduced into the human body, the person becomes (possibly) immune to the disease. True, so far no one has been able to produce such a vaccine, although the plague causative agent was already discovered by Alexander Yersen during the Hong Kong epidemic in 1894. Khavkin grew millions of plague sticks on a special nutrient broth, and then poisoned them with phenol, quenched with chloroform, heated and dried. The obtained sera were tested on rats: dozens of rats were bought on ships that came from other countries, vaccinated, and then plague-sick rats from the city market were put into their cells. Rats died in cages, people died in the streets, time was running out.\nMeanwhile, the epidemic could not be contained and localized. She went beyond the borders of the Bombay presidency and went to travel around the country, reaching Calcutta, Karachi, Delhi and Hyderabad, affecting not only large cities and ports, but also penetrating into the countryside, where she could hardly be counted. Panic, a mess, refugees.\nAnd in Havkin’s small laboratory in January 1897, ten rats survived, vaccinated with another variant of serum and then infected with plague. Fresh rats were obtained from the holds of the steamer that came from Europe and repeated. Then they checked on rabbits and guinea pigs - they survive.\nThe recipe turned out to be incredibly simple, a little at the intersection of science and alchemy:\nThe daily bouillon culture of plague bacilli is bred in a special broth made from non-fat mutton, to which a certain amount of cow butter or coconut butter, purified by boiling with water, is added. Add so much oil that it floats on the surface of the broth with islands. The culture in such a broth developed in the form of processes descending from the surface down. Keep the seeded flasks in a thermostat at a temperature of 28 ° C (room temperature in India) for about 6 weeks, stirring occasionally so that the stalactites settle to the bottom and give rise to new growth. After five weeks, warm the turbid broth carefully at 65 ° C, strain through cheesecloth, with gauze retaining only oil, then add carbolic acid, pour into vials and seal. Heat again to 65 ° C, after which the lymph has the appearance of a thick dark liquid and is ready for use.\nTo test the effect of the vaccine on humans (what rats and rabbits can do, humans can kill people), laboratory workers suggested catching a few volunteers in the slums for a small fee, but the physicians of the late nineteenth century were hopeless humanists and romantics, so they experimented with themselves. Khavkin gave himself an injection, lay down for a couple of days with a high fever, recovered, and went to report the results to the medical council of the anti-plague committee. They also wanted to try, they also lay down with temperature, they all survived too.\nSo, serum does not kill a person - but does it give him immunity against plague infection?\nThe British knew a couple of places where everything was ready for clinical trials.\nRoyal Bikul Prison was intended for persons sentenced to long sentences.\nThe population is 346 prisoners, nine are sick with plague, and five have already died. A closed community, without communication with the outside world, at the very beginning of the epidemic. 154 people agreed to vaccination, while the remaining 183 became a voluntary control group. Of those to whom the vaccine was given, only one person fell ill with the plague and soon recovered. In the control group, at the end of the experiment, twenty-one people died.\nWhen you start conducting experiments on prisoners, sometimes it is difficult to stop. On January 1, 1898, three prisoners of the Umerkad General Prison fell ill, and all three died. Aware of the interesting experience of the Bikul prison, all prisoners wished to get vaccinated.\nDue to the novelty of the case itself and its responsibility to the Anglo-Indian government and society, as well as the need for clear and unequivocal proof of the effect of the vaccine, it was decided to vaccinate only half of the prisoners. Subjects were taken into the courtyard, built, and an injection was made in order to every second prisoner. Among those lucky who received the vaccine - there were no deaths at all. Some of those who did not receive the vaccines died, proving the efficacy and necessity of a new medicine.\nIt was a breakthrough. For the first time, an effective remedy was obtained from the most frightening disease of the Middle Ages, which once almost brought European civilization to its knees, was found. As it turned out later, it was completely useless against the pneumonic form of the plague - and the Russian doctors in Manchuria a decade later again had to stop the disaster with their lives and cruel decisions, but the first step was taken and humanity was no longer defenseless. Before the invention of the vaccine, all plague control methods in one way or another repeated everything that Europeans did in the fourteenth century. The medicine was imperfect, giving only temporary immunity, causing painful and dangerous side effects (high fever, confusion, weakness, diarrhea, pain in all parts of the body, tissue damage at the injection site, acute immune responses, etc.), but it was the first to allow reliable protect people from bubonic plague.\nThe first vaccine was created.\nQuarantine camp.

The buboes on the neck are clearly visible.\nDuring the bombing outbreak of the plague in India, about ten million people died.\nIn the next thirty years, another twelve and a half million.\nOutbreaks with dozens of victims occur today.\nSo it goes.\nSource: https://vk.com/wall-162479647_149188\nAuthor: Sergey Vetrov.

Therefore, so far new training manuals have come, while they figured out,” Uralov explains.\nThe second aspect is the allocation of funds from the European Union, IMF and other international organizations to fight against coronavirus, which neighbors can claim, the political scientist notes.\n“Naturally, Lithuania would like to get the maximum amount of money for itself. Belarusians began to apply for it, and Lithuanians are slowly“ squeezing ”Belarusians from European aid from the European Union,” Uralov said.\nRecall, on the eve of the Belarusian Foreign Ministry responded to the distrust of the Lithuanian leadership to the information on coronavirus, in connection with which the Lithuanian side announced its intention to limit air traffic between Minsk and Vilnius.\nAccording to the statement of the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, the flight between Minsk and Vilnius is needed most likely by the Lithuanian side, since this is one of the few opportunities for delivering Lithuanian citizens home. In addition, any statements of this kind should be based on reliable information and facts, and not on speculation and rumors, the statement said.\nRead also:\n- Lukashenko: we have already cured more than a hundred people, and there was a coronavirus\n- Davydko: we need an online resource on coronavirus in Belarus\n- Mezhevich: in the ocean of pessimism, it's time to think about what will happen after COVID-19"}, {"url": "https://hiwaralssaea.com/%d8%a8%d9%8a%d9%84-%d8%ba%d9%8a%d8%aa%d8%b3-%d9%88%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%a1-%d9%88%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%a1-%d9%86%d8%b4%d8%a3%d8%a9-%d9%88%d8%a7%d9%86%d8%aa%d8%b4%d8%a7%d8%b1-%d9%81%d9%8a%d8%b1%d9%88%d8%b3/", "title": "Bill Gates ...

It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\nIn this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans.\nResearchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than previously thought.\"\nIn contrast, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify \"potential risks\".\nSimon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on the news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: \"If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.\"\nIn October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on \"job promotion\", especially those causing serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans."}, {"url": "http://www.shoah.org.uk/2020/02/10/china-western-china-bashing-vs-western-biowarfare/", "title": "China – Western China Bashing – vs. Western Biowarfare?", "text": "By Peter Koenig\nGlobal Research,\nOn 29 January WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that there was no reason to declare the outbreak of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV in China a pandemic risk. On 30 January, he declared the virus an international emergency, but made clear that there was no reason for countries to issue travel-advisories against travelling to China. Let me speculate – the ‘international emergency’ was declared at the request of Washington, and the comment against the travel-advisory was an addition by Dr. Tedros himself, as he realized that there was indeed no reason for panic, that China is doing wonders in stemming the virus from spreading and in detecting the virus early on.\nNevertheless, and against WHO’s guidance, Washington immediately advised its citizens not to travel to China, and withdrew non-essential staff from US consulates and the Embassy in Beijing, thereby triggering an avalanche of similar reactions among Washington vassals around the globe – i.e. most of the European countries did likewise, many of them canceled their flights to China, as did of course the US.\nRussia also closed her 4,200 km long border, working hand-in-hand with China in containing the virus. This also means that no infected Russian citizen may leave China. This is a concerted Chinese-Russian effort – spearheaded by China – to control and contain the epidemic.\nThe NYT and WashPo are on a vicious daily campaign to slander and vilify China with lies and manipulated information on how badly China is managing the disease, when the complete opposite is the case. Compare this to the common flu epidemic, that hits the US and most of the western countries, despite the fact that the US and Europe have virtually implemented carpet vaccination (in some US States and EU countries even compulsory).\nExpand these statistics to Europe and you find similar figures. Of course, nobody talks about it. This is an annual occurrence – a bonanza for the western pharma industry. In the west, disease is business. The more the merrier. Once you are in the “medical mill”, it’s difficult to escape. “Specialists’ find always another reason to send you yet to another “specialist” – for another treatment. The ignorant patient has no option than to obey – after all its his health and life. In China it is the total opposite. The Chinese system does everything for its population’s health and well-being.The Coronavirus Epidemic: Chinese Resilience and Silent, Simple and Steady Resistance – A Model for Mankind\nYet, China bashing in one way or another seems to intensify by the day. Yesterday, 3 February, the UN in Geneva has issued an edict that all UN employees returning from China must stay home and work from home for 14 days, i.e. a dictated self-quarantine. And new contracts for Chinese staff will be temporarily suspended. This is all propaganda against China.\nIt sounds like a strange coincidence that in October 2019 a simulation with precisely the coronavirus was carried out at the John Hopkins Institute in the US, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the WEF (World Economic Forum), as well as the Pirbright Institute of the UK, one of the world’s few level 4 (highest security level) bio-warfare laboratories (for more details see “China’s Coronavirus: A Global Health Emergency is Launched. What are the Facts”).\n*\nThe west’s ‘demolition’ priority seems to have shifted drastically from Russia to China. Why? – Because China is an ever-stronger economic power, soon to surpass the United States in absolute terms. Since mid-2017, China is already number one, measured by the PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) indicator, indeed the most important one, because it demonstrates what people can actually buy with the money.\nThis new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, may just be a trial. Imagine a stronger mutation of a coronavirus would be implanted into the Chinese population, say with a mortality rate of 10% to 20% or higher – it could cause real havoc. However, a stronger version may not be so easily controllable and directable – i.e. towards the Chinese race – and may risk spreading to the Caucasian race as well – meaning the executioner would risk committing mass suicide."}, {"url": "https://www.saudipress.net/news/487233.html", "title": "Saudi Arabia Press: A famous Russian doctor reveals the secret of immunity against corona virus", "text": "A famous Russian doctor reveals the secret of immunity against corona virus\nSaudi Press - Saudi News ::\nObservatory newspaper: Elena Malysheva, the famous doctor and presenter of the Russian programs, mentioned some nutrients that are able to boost the body's immunity to fight the emerging infection of the Coruna virus.\nShe said during one of her televised medical programs: \"Food products that contain large amounts of zinc are necessary to activate the so-called killer cells in the body, these cells, according to doctor Andreas Prodius, its mission is to kill other cells infected with the virus.\" Noting that humans can get this important component of different foods such as shellfish, oats and corn flakes.\nA famous Russian doctor reveals the secret of immunity against corona virus\nAccording to \"Russia Today\", the doctor advised those suffering from cardiovascular diseases and cancer patients to add the Brazilian nuts to their diet as it contains selenium, which is considered an anti-oxidant and an important component to strengthen the immune system.

More details in the material of the Federal News Agency.\nAmid a pandemic\nThree members of the European Parliament’s faction from the FRG “Greens - European Free Alliance” called on the EU leadership to tackle the alleged disinformation campaign about COVID-19, allegedly conducted by the Russian Federation and China. This is stated in the letter of the parliamentarians, which fell at the disposal of RIA Novosti.\n“We are seriously concerned about the ongoing misinformation and propaganda efforts, especially from China and Russia. For most of us observing the situation, it is obvious that attempts are being made to undermine the EU and spread distrust among the local population and European neighbors regarding the EU, its democratic values and institutions, ”the parliamentarians said in an email.\nAt the same time, the authors of the letter, members of the European Parliament from Germany Alexander Guese, Sergey Lagodinsky and Viola von Kramon-Taubadell throughout the text never give a single concrete case of this “misinformation activity”. Deputies cite the \"recent findings\" of the EU East StratCom Task Force and say that it is these \"conclusions\" that served as the basis for their position.\n“We must continue to build on their (East StratCom Task Force) years of experience to uncover propaganda myths and misinformation strategies,” parliamentarians conclude.\nPropaganda Trick\nAs a member of the Federation Council, Senator Oleg Morozov, it is clear that the statement of the deputies of the Federal Republic of Germany is another propaganda trick. Both China and Russia are completely open even in terms of assistance provided to countries affected by coronavirus.\n“We prove it in practice, not in words. Chinese and Russian experts have long been there. And we provide all kinds of help. How can this be interpreted other than help? It is necessary to have a very violent and perverse fantasy, which sometimes distinguishes our European partners. This situation looks disgusting against the background of the fact that this tragedy claimed the lives of people. And here, on the contrary, we all need to reach out to each other, albeit with gloves, to provide mutual assistance in the fight against this plague. No, they are trying to make politics out of it, ”Oleg Morozov is outraged.\nAccording to the senator, such behavior is very characteristic of European politicians who can pull out a “political skeleton” from any tragedy.\nShift focus\nAccording to an expert at the People’s Diplomacy Foundation Sergei Prostakov, the coronavirus epidemic marks the beginning of an era of crisis of pan-European identity and solidarity. Closed by governments, the national borders of the EU countries have become a clear illustration of its inefficiency, its failed health and safety policies. Therefore, all the bureaucratic structures of the EU, as well as political forces oriented towards the globalist agenda, feel a clear threat of losing their power.\n“Members of the Green Parliamentary European Free Alliance faction are a prime example of such a political force. It was the ideas that they promoted that became one of the main causes of the crisis into which the EU countries plunged, therefore, for self-rehabilitation, they need to shift their focus if they do not specify another culprit. Russia is ideally suited for this, as the entire previous dirty Russophobic campaign of the EU structures is an excellent preparation for this, ”explained Sergey Prostakov.\nAccording to the expert, EU official bodies, like the Task Force on Strategic Communications, are only interested in extending their existence, increasing staffing and financing. However, they do not really care about the security of Europe, which is threatened by bureaucrats who are fueling a conflict with Russia.\n“Therefore, structures like the East StratCom Task Force are willing to help irresponsible politicians such as members of the Greens - European Free Alliance faction, who are ready to mislead society with their Russophobic propaganda and continue to provoke a European-Russian confrontation,” concluded Sergei Prostakov.\nEarlier, Zhao Lijian, the spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said that the US military brought the new coronavirus to the Chinese city of Wuhan. The diplomat analyzed publications about the creation of such a virus in the scientific journal Nature Medicine for 2015 and found an article in which scientists discussed how they created a virus similar to SARS-CoV-2 and how it affects humans."}, {"url": "https://www.rt.com/op-ed/484548-coronavirus--people-die-outcome/", "title": "Covid-19’s meant to be a new Black Death, but in Britain no more people are dying than NORMAL. What does this say about the virus?", "text": "You can bet that the institutions of international government, and the “experts” advising them, will try to massage and cherry-pick statistics to present the version of events that most closely matches their worst-case scenarios. The fact is, according to their early predictions, we are already long overdue millions of Covid-19 deaths that have failed to materialise.\nBut even when Covid-19 deaths are recorded, we have seen how it could be that people are dying with coronavirus rather than dying of it. This concept is easy enough to understand, and it encourages one to take a closer look at the breakdown of deaths across an entire society. The more you follow this rabbit hole down, the more interesting the numbers become. It may be somewhat morbid, but it is nonetheless very important.\nThe most popular twoarticles on the website of The Spectator over the weekend were by Dr John Lee, a recently retired NHS consultant and professor of pathology. He remarks that ‘’we have yet to see any statistical evidence for excess deaths, in any part of the world’’.\nTo check this out, I looked at the British government’s own statistics on total deaths registered weekly across the UK. It shows that in the week ending on the 8th of March 2019, 10,898 people died in total in the UK. This year, in the week ending the 6th of March 2020, the equivalent figure was almost identical: 10,895. Make of that what you will. Statistics are currently available up to March 20, and while there is a lag between the spread of the virus and the resulting deaths, so far only about 1 percent of all mortalities bear any relation to coronavirus, and there is no visible spike. If nothing else, it helps to view the extent of the crisis in proportion - thousands of people die each week, and from the long-term view what we are seeing is not a plague, but a blip.\nSo when all is said and done, will any additional people die of the coronavirus? And what is meant by extra or additional?\nUnderstanding this requires a bit of lateral thinking, but it helps to remember that everyone on Earth has a terminal disease: being alive. We all have to go sometime.\nRecording exactly how and when we do is a big part of the job of statistician Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter. In a recent blog post, he outlined the concept of background risk. This is obtained by recording all of the people dying in any given year, at any given age. At its most simple, this is the percentage chance a person has of not reaching their next birthday, based solely on their age. Of course, that is not to say that if you are a 40-year-old man you have precisely a 0.2% chance of dying this year - the data are based on averages, and do not apply to individuals.\nBut nonetheless, across a country or given populations, the averages will be right, and it is possible to predict with great accuracy how many people will die in a given year. In the UK, for example, 600,000 people die annually. But wait a minute! A novel, brand-spanking new coronavirus is terrorising us all. Therefore surely we can expect more people to die this year than would in a normal year? And come year’s end we should be able, with simple arithmetic, to count exactly how many more there were.\nSpiegelhalter, chair of the Winton Centre for Evidence and Risk Communication at Cambridge University, won’t say exactly what he does think that figure will be. But he does say that if the deaths are towards the lower end of the current estimates, say at around 20,000 in the UK, Covid-19 will end up having ‘’a minimal impact on overall mortality for 2020’’. He told R4 that his findings showed, to his own professed astonishment, that if someone contracts the coronavirus, they’ve got almost exactly the same chance of dying over the ensuing few weeks as they would normally have of dying over the next year, no matter what their age or background health.\nAnd depending on who you ask, that 20,000 figure might still be an overestimate. In fact, Spiegelhalter says that if extra people die it will likely be as a result of the knock-on effects of the lockdown, such as delayed normal health care, depression and isolation.\nAmerican political commentator Candace Owens has been Tweeting consistently about the apparent insignificance of Covid-19 deaths compared to overall trends. She tweeted about this issue in relation to New York City, where meaningless figures are being waved around by the media.\nAn article this morning claims NYC is facing a catastrophe because they have had 450 Coronavirus deaths since January & someone is dying every 17 minutes. So you know—regularly, NYC has 419 deaths every single day & loses a person every 9 minutes. Just for perspective.\nAn article this morning claims NYC is facing a catastrophe because they have had 450 Coronavirus deaths since January & someone is dying every 17 minutes. So you know—regularly, NYC has 419 deaths every single day & loses a person every 9 minutes. Just for perspective. — Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) March 28, 2020\nWith all of the numbers being bandied about these days by various universities and governments, one would swear that they knew exactly what they were talking about. Make no mistake: this air of certainty is just a front. It is definitely too early to accurately gauge how many – if any – extra people will die because of coronavirus. It will depend on how four key pieces of information intersect.\nThese are:\nHow many people will become infected by Covid-19?\nHow much does Covid-19 increase the risk of death?\nAre deaths being properly recorded? Of those people who die having contracted coronavirus, are they dying from the virus, or just with it?\nOf those who died, how many had comorbidities that would have killed them this year anyway?\nSince all of this began, the mainstream media have focused almost entirely on the first of these points, and stressing with an onslaught of material how important it is to slow the spread. The most extreme possible measures have been implemented to do that. Meanwhile, the three other points could end up comparing Covid-19 pretty much to the common flu. Only careful consideration by governments of all the key factors will result in the best future decisions.\nIt is hard to believe that when this all blows over, the damage that will have been done by the shutdown measures – to businesses, to civil liberties, to individual lives and, of course, to the global economy – could have been for nothing. Nonetheless, it seems entirely possible based on the present data. Remember above all to not take the figures the mainstream media throw at you at face value; there are lies, damned lies and statistics.\nLike this story?

As expected, as promised as any idiot might guess, political leadership has failed and the organizations intended to coordinate the planetary response to biological threats has shown itself to be politicized, weakened or possibly worse.\nOn March 30, 2020, the Berman Law Group of Boca Raton, Florida, filed a $20 trillion lawsuit against the government of China for creating and disseminating the COVID 19 virus which has, well, we don’t really know.\nOne has to remind one’s self of our times. A few years ago, what was termed an “Arab Spring” emerged, largely manipulated by militarized subsidiaries of Google and Facebook, funded by totalitarian regimes aligned with the US.\n“Spring,” as it turned out means something different to the people of the Middle East. The social reformers of the West delivered head choppers and Islamists, stolen oil and looted factories and not so much democracy as promised.\nThen, as so easily predicted, those who brought the disease thus offered the cure, “coalition” bombings, occupation, drone assassination and unending suffering.\nIn Ukraine, “spring” meant false flag snipers and downing an airliner followed by a descent into politics more familiar to those who studied the last century and the fascist attempt to rule the world.\nNothing is as it seems, nothing seen can be believed, nothing read is true, nothing taught exists, all is flimflammery and bluster, buffoonery and mayhem.\nWell, what does one see? Living in the United States, one sees a lockdown of a nation for one, two, three or more months. What one doesn’t see is where, exactly 200 million people are, how they live, where the money comes from to feed them and what the sinking feeling of hopelessness is doing to them.\nFor the “haves,” well financed retirees or medical workers not yet infected, life may be changed, even grim but it will continue.\nQuite recently, a number of publications began spreading the rumor that 21 million Chinese mobile phone users had simply disappeared, meaning that they had died of COVID 19 and were now in mass graves.\nThis type of story is common and such things spring up almost daily. The reason isn’t simple, a sea of absurd lies is manufactured by “think tanks” in order to drown those gems of embarrassing truth that escaped the Google censors or the control of the corporate media.\nHere in the US, the concern is generated by driving past miles of closed factories, stores and restaurants. The government plans to send out small checks to cover up to 5% of economic losses of the working poor who were always no more than 3 weeks from homelessness.\nNow they can’t be thrown out on the street, not for awhile anyway, law has prevented this but the lost income will never be replaced, income that paid insurance, health care for children, bought food and clothing and that American lifestyle of fast food, cable television and continual texting.\nThose jobs, the restaurants and shops, many of the factories, no longer exist. No bail out can save them in a permanently retracted economy that will never be able to reabsorb millions of workers whose livelihood was governed by economic fakery.\nWhere two weeks before stores were emptied, now the money that financed buying carloads of toilet paper has dwindled away.\nNo one talks of this. No one reports this. No one asks where 200 million Americans are, how they feed their kids, how they spend their days, and how fear is playing on their vulnerability.\nThere is no social welfare state in America. The benefits for retirees, Medicare and Social Security, are being chipped away by “conservative” politics.\nHealth care for veterans, and there are many millions of former military whose lives were destroyed while America destroyed the Middle East, has disappeared, unspoken of and unreported.\nVeterans are being told they are being removed from health care and can no longer be treated, including and especially the totally disabled combat veterans. Supplies don’t exist, the pharmacies are out of medications and it didn’t start with COVID 19, it began with Donald Trump. Veterans’ health care, the largest health care system in the world, disappeared when no one was looking. It is dead and gone.\nIt will never be reported, no organization will complain to congress because, you see, if you aren’t a bank or oil company, one of those with their hands out for $6 trillion in free money from the Trump regime, you don’t exist.\nA few paragraphs ago we mentioned the massive lawsuit against China. The assumption that China created COVID 19 is based on an important research paper written in 2015 that tied a research facility in Wuhan to a study on a bat virus that created something capable of infecting the world, a disease exactly like COVID 19.\nThis is the origin of the “blame China” ploy, just like the blame Russia for fake gas attacks in Syria or when the Kiev regime shot down MH17.\nAll that was needed was a fake court, fake evidence and controlled media.\nWith the accusation against China, all that is needed is for China to be tied, in this case for supplying a virus, to a dangerous terror group, to a global pandemic.\nThe terror group, as we discovered was the USAID, a CIA affiliate that used the Wuhan virus to create something frightening at the University of North Carolina, not in Wuhan.\nA lawsuit and trial will condemn China in a rigged American court. Experts, so many experts, who saw China defeat the disease in weeks while it has run rampant across the US, have come to believe that the US was always the origin and that COVID 19 had been around for some time inside the US before showing up in China.\nWhat is strange is that some questions are never asked. Why so many die in Northern Italy? The best hospitals in the world are there, no transportation hubs, no ties to “Wuhan” and no bio-warfare labs? Are they being experimented on?\nThen we have Detroit, another anomaly. A city of all private homes, a city filled with poor, a disease spread rapidly through a community that uses no public transportation and that has been housebound by weather for months.\nNo one looks for a “patient zero” or “super-spreader,” a term used in studies on bio-terrorism.\nThe other untold story is the restructuring of America’s employment environment, no trade unions anymore, no contracts, no benefits, no guarantees, the war on the worker that Reagan began and Bush (43) won behind the smokescreen of 9/11 and the fake War on Terror.\nYou see, injured workers seldom qualify for benefits and those laid off because of economic slowdowns are denied benefits though processes of fake accusations and legal trickery.\nIt gets worse, if you are injured on a job, let’s say a piece of heavy equipment breaks and you are seriously injured. Not only will you likely never receive wage compensation, but you are likely to be denied needed medical care as well. Medical treatment is often withheld, other than enough to make sure you don’t die right away, until a “hearings process” is exhausted, which can take up to two years. During that time, a physical injury will often lead to permanent crippling and care, when it becomes available eventually, is palliative only, often opiate pain relievers.\nThis is what is meant when it is said that the social welfare “SafetyNet” in the US has disappeared.\nThis is where 200 million Americans without hope now live, to fend for themselves and watch television, being told day and night to hate China and wait for a check with Donald Trump’s signature that might buy tires for a car that was repossessed.\nGordon Duff is a Marine combat veteran of the Vietnam War that has worked on veterans and POW issues for decades and consulted with governments challenged by security issues.

However, in Russia no outbreak of coronavirus has occurred, and in Iran there are already hundreds of cases. And this also does not fit into the version of the \"natural origin of the strain.\" In addition, the Chinese themselves have already recognized that there is no outbreak inside the country, and the virus has been planted from the outside.\n“Because the virus is hybrid, it is clearly a new generation of biological weapons. The code consists of two parts plus four HIV inserts. In nature, such a combination could not turn out, in my opinion. It could only happen in the laboratory, ”the expert said in an interview with Constantinople.\n“Because the virus is hybrid, it is clearly a new generation of biological weapons. The code consists of two parts plus four HIV inserts. In nature, such a combination could not turn out, in my opinion. It could only happen in the laboratory, ”the expert said in an interview with Constantinople.\nCreating a vaccine against any strain is quite a long matter, it takes at least a year, if not more. However, now the Americans and the British are ready to implement it, the expert recalled. It turns out that it was created in advance? And this all the more does not fit into the version about the natural origin of the strain.\nIn addition, in China, where from time immemorial traditionally eat everything that moves, even snakes, even bats, have never had serious diseases. And then suddenly, over the past two decades, eight dangerous coronaviruses that infected people have been identified right away. And this began to happen immediately after the Americans in 1999 adopted a program to create ethnically specific biological weapons. So all this for good reason, says Nikulin.\n“It is clear to whom it is beneficial. It is already obvious that by April the world economy will show a decline of a trillion dollars, that is, assets will become cheaper and they can be bought up. And this is very beneficial for the owners of world money: for the sake of three hundred percent profit, capital will be spent on any crimes, ”the military expert concluded.\n“It is clear to whom it is beneficial.

And this is very beneficial for the owners of world money: for the sake of three hundred percent profit, capital will be spent on any crimes, ”the military expert concluded.\nAccording to Igor Nikulin, there are more than enough reasons for suspicions that the coronavirus is a US biological weapon. Firstly, the time and place are too well chosen to be considered a mere coincidence. Now between China and the United States, the height of the trade war, and US President Donald Trump half a year ago, said that if the Chinese did not change their minds, they would regret it.\nWhy the outbreak occurred in Wuhan, and not in Beijing, Hong Kong or Shanghai, is also approximately clear. In Hong Kong, there is a pro-American Maidan. There are a lot of American representative offices in Shanghai, almost all American companies are there, thousands of Americans work there, if not tens of thousands. And Beijing is the capital, there are too much control measures, there are a million cameras with face fixation, the expert explains.\n“So they chose where control is weaker, respectively, plus the fact that there is an institute of virology there is also good, you can blame the Chinese that they arranged everything for themselves, so successfully and on New Year’s,” said Igor Nikulin in Interview Tsargrad.\n“So they chose where control is weaker, respectively, plus the fact that there is an institute of virology there is also good, you can blame the Chinese that they arranged everything for themselves, so successfully and on New Year’s,” said Igor Nikulin in Interview Tsargrad.\nIn addition, there was an American consulate in Wuhan. But they closed it, and before the Chinese announced an epidemic, the expert says. So they knew about it beforehand? The information is also not in their favor, says Nikulin.\n“That is, there are many details that show that this is no coincidence,” he emphasizes.\n“That is, there are many details that show that this is no coincidence,” he emphasizes."}, {"url": "https://southfront.org/waves-of-mutilation-medical-tyranny-and-the-cashless-society/", "title": "Waves Of Mutilation: Medical Tyranny And The Cashless Society", "text": "Donate\nWritten by Brandon Smith; Originally appeared on alt-market.com\nBack in 2014 during the Ebola scare in the US I published an article warning about how a global pandemic could be used by the elites as cover for the implementation of an economic collapse as well as martial law measures in western nations. My immediate concern was the way in which a viral outbreak could be engineered or exploited as a rationale for a level of social control that the public would never accept under normal circumstances. And this could be ANY viral outbreak, not just Ebola. The point is the creation of an “invisible enemy” that the populace cannot quantify and defend itself against without constant government oversight.\nI noted specifically how the government refused to apply air travel restrictions in 2014 to nations where the outbreak had taken hold when they could have stopped the spread in its tracks. This is something that was done again in 2020 as the UN’s WHO and governments including our government in the US refused to stop air travel from China, pretending as if it was not a hot zone and that the virus was nothing to worry about.\nThis attitude of nonchalance serves a purpose. The establishment NEEDS the pandemic to spread, because then they have a rationale for strict controls of pubic activities and movements. This is the end goal. They have no care whatsoever for public health or safety. The end game is to acquire power, not save lives. In fact, they might prefer a higher death count in the beginning as this would motivate the public to beg for more restrictions in the name of security.\nAuthorities went from downplaying the outbreak and telling people not to bother with preparations like purchasing N95 masks, to full blown crisis mode only weeks later. In January Trump initially claimed he “trusted” the data out of China and said that “everything was under control”; as usual only a couple months down the road and Trump flip-flopped on both assertions. The World Health Organization refused to even label this outbreak a “pandemic” until the virus was entrenched across the globe. The question people will ask is, was this all due to incompetence, or was it social engineering?\nThe Ebola event six years ago seems to have been a dry run for what is happening today. I believe it is entirely deliberate, and I will explain why in this article, but either way, governments have proven they cannot be trusted to handle the pandemic crisis, nor can they be trusted to protect the people and their freedoms.\nAt the same time, the pandemic itself is tightly intertwined with economic collapse. The two events feed off one another. The pandemic provides perfect cover for the crash of the massive debt bubble central banks and international banks have created over the years. I noted in February that the global economy was crashing long before the coronavirus ever showed up. At the same time, economic chaos increases 3rd world conditions within each country, which means poor nutrition and health care options that cause more sickness and more deaths from the virus. As outlined in 2014:\n“Who would question the event of an economic collapse in the wake of an Ebola (virus) soaked nightmare? Who would want to buy or sell? Who would want to come in contact with strangers to generate a transaction? Who would even leave their house? Ebola (viral) treatment in first world nations has advantages of finance and a cleaner overall health environment, but what if economic downturn happens simultaneously? America could experience third world status very quickly, and with it, all the unsanitary conditions that result in an exponential Ebola (pandemic) death rate.\n…Amidst even a moderate or controlled viral scenario, stocks and bonds will undoubtedly crash, a crash that was going to happen anyway. The international banks who created the mess get off blameless, while Ebola (viral outbreak), an act of nature, becomes the ultimate scapegoat for every disaster that follows.”\nAs the double threat of financial collapse and viral pandemic accelerate, fear becomes widespread for those that never prepared ahead of time (and we’re talking about millions of people). When people are afraid they tend to sacrifice their freedoms to anyone that offers them a promise of safety, no matter how empty. For now, the public is being convinced to assume that lockdowns and restrictions are temporary, but this is a lie. The elites must maintain and increase restrictions with each passing month in order to prevent rebellion until they are ready to implement martial law measures.\nYou see, the establishment is going for broke with this event, and because of this there is the potential for them to face dire consequences. The facade is quickly evaporating; the collectivists and globalists are risking exposure of themselves and their political puppets in order to build a totalitarian system with extreme speed. The establishment must keep the pressure on for now, because if the public is allowed to breath for just a moment they might look around and wake up to the bigger agenda. The public has to be forced to beg for aid from the authorities; only then will the pressure be lifted for a short time. The public has to believe the control grid was THEIR idea.\nA new process of mass conditioning is about to be set in motion, using “waves” of panic and then waves of release and calm. After studying the behavioral traits and methods of narcissistic sociopaths (psychopaths) for many years, I can tell you this form of conditioning is very familiar. This is exactly what they always do, just on a global scale – They create an atmosphere of crisis to keep people around them unbalanced and on edge, then “relieve the pressure” intermittently so that those same people relax and their anger is deflated for a time. Then, the process starts all over again…\nThis conditioning traps the narcopath’s victims in a constant state of flux and uncertainty, and the moments of calm become a placebo which prevent their rebellion against him. He can then feed off his victims at his leisure like a psychological vampire, and often these victims will see the narcopath as their only means of support. They have been convinced that all the threats are coming from the outside; they do not realize the source of the threats is the person standing right next to them.\nThe wave model of conditioning and control is starting to show up everywhere, and it is most blatant in the intended “solution” presented by establishment elites in response to the coronavirus outbreak. As Truthstream Media outlined in their excellent video ‘We Are Living In 12 Monkeys’, MIT recently published a paper written by their globalist editor in chief Gideon Lichfield titled ‘We’re Not Going Back To Normal’ which admits quite brazenly how the elites intend to use this crisis to their advantage.\nLichfield lays out a kind of programming schedule for the population based on waves of viral infection outbreaks, waves of tight social restrictions, followed by waves of limited economic activity and limited calm over the next 18 months. As Lichfield suggests:\n“To stop coronavirus we will need to radically change almost everything we do: how we work, exercise, socialize, shop, manage our health, educate our kids, take care of family members.\nWe all want things to go back to normal quickly. But what most of us have probably not yet realized—yet will soon—is that things won’t go back to normal after a few weeks, or even a few months. Some things never will.”\nHe continues:\n“As long as someone in the world has the virus, breakouts can and will keep recurring without stringent controls to contain them. In a report yesterday researchers at Imperial College London proposed a way of doing this: impose more extreme social distancing measures every time admissions to intensive care units (ICUs) start to spike, and relax them each time admissions fall…”\nUnderstand that there are 7 billion people on the planet, and this process of control could go on for years while we wait for every person to overcome the virus or die from it. The only way for the public to escape this purgatory (according to Lichfield) is for them to submit to a biometric data grid. They must volunteer (or be forced) to participate in 24/7 tracking through their cell phones and through mass surveillance. In order to function in society, an individual must have the proper digital marker which tells the authorities that they are “clean” and devoid of infection. The system is being used in China right now:\nThis system achieves a number of things. Much like the social credit system China has been using for the past few years, the public is compelled to constantly appease the hidden but all seeing eye of government. Everything they do is watched by algorithms and surveillance. Any deviation might trigger scrutiny and a loss of simple freedoms to move around or participate in normal human interaction. Lichfield argues:\n“Ultimately, however, I predict that we’ll restore the ability to socialize safely by developing more sophisticated ways to identify who is a disease risk and who isn’t, and discriminating—legally—against those who are.\n…one can imagine a world in which, to get on a flight, perhaps you’ll have to be signed up to a service that tracks your movements via your phone. The airline wouldn’t be able to see where you’d gone, but it would get an alert if you’d been close to known infected people or disease hot spots. There’d be similar requirements at the entrance to large venues, government buildings, or public transport hubs. There would be temperature scanners everywhere, and your workplace might demand you wear a monitor that tracks your temperature or other vital signs. Where nightclubs ask for proof of age, in future they might ask for proof of immunity—an identity card or some kind of digital verification via your phone, showing you’ve already recovered from or been vaccinated against the latest virus strains.”\nAnd there you have it. The social and biometric control grid that globalists have been hungry to set up for years now has the perfect catalyst – a viral pandemic which could cycle indefinitely; all that would be needed is to release a designer virus every couple years which renews public fear. The populace becomes increasingly dependent on government for everything as their very survival depends on their ability to function within the new economy, and without a special mark granted by government saying you are not an infection risk, you could be shunned from all trade and participation.\nRefuse to get vaccinated due to health concerns? You’re kicked out of the economy. Homeschool your children? They have not been monitored and are therefore an infection risk, and your whole family is kicked out of the economy. Hold political views that are contrary to globalism? Maybe you are listed as a danger to the system and wrongly labeled infected as punishment; and then you are kicked out of the economy. The establishment can use the threat of economic removal to condition many people into complacency or slavery.\nThe MIT editor goes on to drive his point home in rather arrogant fashion:\n“We’ll adapt to and accept such measures, much as we’ve adapted to increasingly stringent airport security screenings in the wake of terrorist attacks. The intrusive surveillance will be considered a small price to pay for the basic freedom to be with other people.”\nBeyond the effort to turn “social distancing” into a new cultural norm enforced by law, there is another agenda being quietly instituted – the cashless society. More and more businesses are starting to refuse cash payments, claiming that paper cash spreads the virus. Oddly enough, they still accept debit cards using pin pads which are much more likely than cash to spread disease.\nThis may force the public to keep their money in banks despite the threat of a credit freeze or bank holiday. What if you pull cash out of your accounts but are not able to spend it anywhere? Eventually, they will ban debit and credit card transactions in stores as well, and replace them with a non-interactive payment model. This will probably be done through your cell phone in the beginning using a scanning app. In the end, they will use your biometric data for all money transactions.\nThis forces the public, yet again, to carry a cell phone on them everywhere for their very survival. The tracking network for the virus as well as the new payment transaction system makes this device indispensable. If you want to participate in society, you will have no choice but to be tracked and traced at all times.\nUnless, of course, you build your own system of trade and interaction.\nThe solution to medical tyranny and the cashless society is to not need the system at all for your own survival. This means people will have to build their own economies based on barter and local scrip. They will have to dump their cell phones and rely on other forms of communication such as radio, or establish a digital communication system separate and independent from the establishment system. They will have to become producers and achieve more self reliance. They will have to break free from the grid, and this has to start RIGHT NOW.\nOf course, the establishment will claim that these independent people are a threat to everyone else simply by existing. They will perpetuate the lie of “herd immunity” and will claim that independent people will “spread the virus”, even to those who are supposedly protected through vaccination. And eventually they will try to stop decoupled and localized communities from existing using force. At that point we simply go to war with the elites, as we were always going to have to do anyway. The alternative is slavery in the name of the “greater good”, but there is no greater good without freedom, and there is no society without individuality. Pandemic be damned.\nDonate"}, {"url": "https://es.news-front.info/2020/03/13/la-otan-provoco-una-catastrofe-global-el-coronavirus-de-repente-sirvio-a-los-intereses-de-la-alianza/", "title": "NATO caused a global catastrophe: The coronavirus suddenly served the interests of the alliance", "text": "The coronavirus infection epidemic plunged the world into chaos, which turned out to be in the hands of Western political elites.\nJohan Beckman, an associate professor at the University of Helsinki, said this in a comment to the iReactor.\nAccording to him, the current situation would not be so catastrophic if it were not for the manipulation of NATO. Thanks to the efforts of the Western military bloc, the epidemic has also become a kind of armed conflict on a global scale. Beckman points out that this situation is perfect for NATO to resolve certain scenarios of war.\n“The coronavirus was the result of NATO's maneuvers.

They became known for their scale and clear anti-Russian orientation.\nThe task of the maneuvers is to solve the only operation: to counter the enemy in the European theater of operations by causing enough damage to force the opponent to capitulate. Although the organizers do not indicate who exactly they mean by the enemy, it is clear that in Europe it can only be Russia.

Intravenous administration of vitamin C is already used in China against COVID-19 coronavirus. However, a large amount is needed, administered intravenously because, in this case, the effects are ten times stronger, according to experts in China.\nThe editor of the Chinese edition of OMNS, Dr. Richard Cheng, reports from China about the first confirmed study regarding the intravenous administration of 12,000 to 24,000 mg / day of vitamin C, writes greenmedinfo.com. The doctor also calls for the immediate use of vitamin C to prevent coronavirus (COVID-19).\nA second clinical trial of intravenous vitamin C was announced in China on February 13th. In this second study, doctors “intend to administer 6,000 mg / day and 12,000 mg / day for moderate and severe cases. We are also communicating with other hospitals to start more studies on vitamin C. We want these studies to include the administration of vitamin C orally, because in this case it can be taken by several patients at home, \"says Dr. Cheng. .\nAlso, on February 21, 2020, a third approved research study for intravenously administered vitamin C against COVID-19 was announced.\nDr. Cheng, a certified specialist in anti-aging medicine, added that “the administration of vitamin C is very promising in terms of prevention and is especially important in treating dying patients when there is no better treatment. (...) The emphasis is wrongly only on vaccines and antiviral drugs specific for epidemics \", the doctor added.\nHe also says that sufficiently high doses of intravenous vitamin C given early are of critical importance. Vitamin C is not only a prototypical antioxidant, but is also involved in killing the virus and preventing the spread of the virus.\n\"Therefore, we call for a global debate on this issue,\" Cheng said.\nOn the other hand, specialists who claim that vitamin C therapy can stop coronavirus are labeled as promoting \"false information\" and \"false news\". Even the distribution of verifiable news and quotes from accredited medical specialists is restricted or blocked on social networks, writes greenmedinfo.com. Examples of this phenomenon can be seen on this Facebook page.\nIndeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) has met with Google and Facebook and other media giants to stop the spread of what they consider to be misinformation. Scientific debates about COVID-19 do not seem to be allowed.\nIronically, Facebook, which blocks the distribution of news about vitamin C research, is blocked in China by the Chinese government. But what is significant is that the Chinese government has not blocked this real news about how intravenously administered vitamin C can save lives in the COVID-19 epidemic.\nThe medical establishment is obsessively focused on looking for a COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine and / or drug. While they are looking for what would be fabulously profitable treatments, vitamin C is a plausible, clinically proven method for treating the condition that can cause the death of coronavirus patients: severe acute respiratory syndrome or pneumonia."}, {"url": "https://www.elwatannews.com/news/details/4667097", "title": "Global Health: We did not detect HIV infections in Yemen", "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed today, Wednesday, that it has not received any report of any confirmed infection with the emerging coronavirus in Yemen.\nThe organization said, through the account of its mission in Yemen on Twitter, \"Until the moment, no confirmed cases of the new Corona virus in Yemen have been reported,\" according to Sputnik News Agency.\nThe \"World Health\", it \"in coordination with the Ministry of Public Health and Population supports the preparation of a quarantine center in Aden to ensure preparedness and response in the event of the emergence of cases.\"\nIn a related context, Mohamed Abdel Salam, a spokesman for the \"Ansar Allah Group\" (Houthis) in Yemen, said that it does not rule out that the Corona virus is an American industry that has spiraled out of control until part of it returned to it.\n\"Abdel Salam\", who is the head of the negotiating delegation, \"Ansar Allah\", added through his account on Twitter: \"This is a hypothesis that is under discussion.\" American\"."}, {"url": "https://novorosinform.org/809832", "title": "Alexei Leonkov: Coronavirus is a type of weapon in a hybrid war", "text": "The coronavirus epidemic has already affected the functioning of many countries in the world. Quarantine and self-isolation regimes, broken international relations, economic problems are the first results of the pandemic. The military expert, editor of Arsenal of the Fatherland magazine Alexei Leonkov spoke about the causes of this virus and the processes that it will contribute to on the world agenda in an interview with Novorossia Information Agency.\nIA Novorossiya: In your opinion, what are the root causes of such a massive spread of the virus?\nAlexei Leonkov: The outbreak of the epidemic, or, as its World Health Organization has called, a pandemic can be viewed from different angles. If from a medical point of view, this is an outbreak that caused a large number of infected, dead, but including recovered people, but it does not look as scary as the Ebola virus or the plague, which mowed a third of the population of Europe in the 14th century. But if you look from the point of view of economics and hybrid wars, then this is a new type of weapon that was unexpectedly imported or activated by “globalization agents”, that is, those who used to build a model of a unipolar world.\nWhen the supporters of the unipolar world realized that they won’t be able to regain peace by armed means and open intervention, that is, they will receive a worthy response from Russia or China, economic sanctions against Russia and a trade war against China also did not entail the expected results, they released this virus out.\nNow the genome of the virus has been decoded in China and in Russia, and it has become known that it does not have a natural origin. Despite the fact that now the Western press is trying to pretend that this virus came from bats, everyone knows that the SARS virus, which was found only in China and really hit bats, was taken as the basis. As a result, under the auspices of the USAID agency in four laboratories in the USA - one of which was in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and the second in Swiss Zurich - experiments were conducted. Their essence was to create a kind of chimera virus and, on its basis, try to study all the possible pathologies that it causes and find an antidote to them. In addition to the SARS virus, the second virus used in the experiment was HIV, and in order to make it easier to contact, a synthesized protein was grafted to it, with the help of which the virus can be transmitted from organism to organism. And now we are discussing that the eliminated coronavirus “travels” across all continents.\nSo, the spread of this virus was facilitated by a powerful information campaign that the United States and Great Britain launched against China. As soon as China started talking about having problems with the virus, turned to the whole world and asked for help, it actually received an economic and transport blockade from the United States. Naturally, the Chinese economy sank sharply, experts prophesied that the PRC would no longer recover, and wrote off the country for scrap. But the situation did not develop further according to the intended scenario. The very Wuhan laboratory, in the most severe conditions, localized the virus - the city was blocked immediately, 12 million people remained in quarantine, and specialists, working around the clock, found a way to treat this virus. After that, the dynamics of the disease in China began to decline, and the number of recovered now almost equals the number of cases. We can say that China defeated this virus.\nThe next point of mass disease was Northern Italy. Many wondered why this place was. But if you look at the map, then next to Northern Italy is Switzerland, in which the Zurich Institute of Virology also conducted experiments. I believe that these two outbreaks of the virus are associated with the United States - the Americans have actually thrown in this virus. I am not saying that the current government did it, because in the United States there are now enough opponents of power, just the very globalists who will go all out for the sake of achieving their goals. After all, in Italy they did not find the “null” patient, from whom the epidemic began, and the disease began to spread very quickly throughout Europe. In fact, the spread of the virus has now paralyzed all the economic ties of the global world, which was built under the auspices of the United States.\nIA Novorossiya: Why, then, did the virus run? It is for the sake of imbalance in economic relations between countries?\nA.L .: The fact is that the economic model of general consumption implies an infinite resource base. But those countries that are developing and have resources understand that they need the resources themselves. The United States began to meet some resistance around the world, and it was necessary to change this economic model, because the public debt of many leading countries of the world - I mean Europe and the USA - has now grown exponentially.\nThey could either dismantle this system and build a new one, but such a path leads to social upheaval, revolutionary uprisings and the collapse of Western civilization in general, or seize resource bases, and Russia has the largest base.\nThe total wealth of Russia several times covers the global debt of the entire financial system. Therefore, the virus was not directed against the whole world, but, first of all, against Russia and China. Basically, the attack on Russia is now taking place in the information field. When the virus got out of control, this can now be ascertained by the reaction of the governments of Europe and the USA, it turned out that America’s advanced medical system, which they tried to impose on all countries, does not work. It works in conditions of well-being, when there is a certain class of the population that receives all medical care, and a large group of people who can receive only emergency assistance.\nUntil March 11, in the United States, they could not identify all patients with coronavirus, and in the epicrisis of the dead they wrote flu, bronchitis and pneumonia. It was not until March 11th that the USA began to receive the first tests, and this is the foremost country in virology. Of course, you need to understand that the virology of the Americans is peculiar: there is a public and a secret one that conducts experiments with viruses and genome-modified biological objects. And with the secrecy of work on viruses, the United States could not produce an antidote on an industrial scale in case the result of the study went out of control. What we have now.\nThe Americans, once again embarking on an adventure, themselves themselves plunged into it with a loud bang. They could not show anything to the world - neither a solution to the problem, nor tests for the virus. The United States tried to buy medical firms around the world that are just dealing with vaccine development so that all the results belong only to them. This once again shows how powerless they were by releasing this “kraken”. After all, the disease spreads all over the world, even in island states, and all because the virus was originally designed to live in a person. Therefore, how long the pandemic will last, how the world processes will be affected, the Americans can no longer predict. But there are treatment methods - in Russia and in China. Vaccines are also being developed in South Korea, the United States has already turned to her to get help as an ally.\nAs a conclusion, we can say that coronavirus is a type of bacteriological weapon, which is an important tool in a hybrid war. It undermines the economic, financial, political condition of states and brings them to the brink of collapse of sovereignty.\nIf the state does not cope with this new misfortune, then unrest begins in the country. These facts can already be observed.\nIA Novorossiya: It turns out that coronavirus does not so much affect current world politics as it is a way to conduct it, an instrument, as you said?\nYes, it’s an instrument, and they are now trying to let off steam in the financial and economic system that has dominated the world for a long time. There is a party that wants to “blow off this steam” and tackle a slightly different issue - this is Trump’s party, he himself says, stop getting sick, you need to work. And there is another side that claims that we will all die and that we must punish those who are guilty of this. This is the party that released this coronavirus.\nIA Novorossiya: At one point, because of the epidemic, Donbass was isolated. After Russia, it again opened the borders for the inhabitants of the LPR and the DPR, but quarantine measures are also being taken in the Republics. What problems and changes will the virus epidemic entail for Donbass and Ukraine, in particular in the political and military aspects?\nA.L .: It’s clear that Ukraine was completely unprepared for such a pandemic, because recently it barely managed to cope with an outbreak of measles, which miraculously erupted in its territory after 15 biological laboratories were opened. These laboratories had to study viruses, find antidotes to them, that is, help Ukraine in the event of such an epidemic. For example, in the same Georgia there was a similar biolaboratory doing research. And when the first patients with coronavirus appeared in Georgia, it turned out that this laboratory was not able to do anything. She was not engaged in drug development, but in collecting materials and studying the effects of the virus on it, while not producing an antidote. I believe that the same thing happens with Ukrainian laboratories, which were also opened by the Americans. In addition, most of these laboratories are private, and they may refuse to provide assistance.\nI believe that many facts of coronavirus disease in Ukraine are hushed up. The number of cases, especially those that came from Europe, is probably more than voiced. As far as I know, when Ukraine closed the border with Europe, most citizens entered the country without any medical examination. For this reason, it is likely that the outbreak of coronavirus in Ukraine will be large-scale.\nAs for the Republics of Donbass and the military conflict that Ukraine is leading, the situation looks rather paradoxical. Europe is not up to Ukraine now, it is engaged in \"extinguishing a fire\" under the name coronavirus. The same thing happens in the USA. However, nobody canceled the decision to build new bases or military training centers. That is, money is allocated for this, and the Americans are still fulfilling their program. Ukraine still wants money, needs it, as well as loans from the International Monetary Fund, and therefore it decided to introduce an emergency regime for a month. This will help Kiev avoid a monthly payment of the IMF tranche and even request additional assistance. Although Europe will not be able to allocate financial assistance now - because of the coronavirus, Europe also has quarantine, self-isolation and IMF money will be used to support the EU countries themselves.\nThat is, Europe has its own problems above the roof. The question of the epidemic, the European Union, strange as it may sound, is decided \"state\" - each country fights with it on its own. Italy turned to the EU and NATO countries for help, but no one provided it. Italy, China and Cuba decided to help Italy - countries against which Italy imposed sanctions in an allied outburst. Each EU state has become isolated, so we can say that because of the coronavirus epidemic, the European Union de facto ceased to exist.\nReturning again to the question of Donbass and Ukraine, it is worth noting that in the current situation the “fragmented” EU is not able to make any decisions that may concern negotiations in the “Norman format”. However, more importantly, the meeting of the four was to be held only if Kiev had fulfilled its obligations.\nUkraine will now take advantage of the fact that an emergency regime has been introduced, but after all, it did nothing before the epidemic. That is, the coronavirus contributes to the fact that the meeting does not take place, or not, it does not matter - the obligations were not fulfilled.\nMoreover, Ukraine has now increased the intensity of shelling along the entire line of contact. The feeling that in this way Kiev is trying to show that active hostilities began again on the front. Maybe such \"telegrams\" really go to the European Union and the USA: Kiev says that the war has started again, Lugansk and Donetsk are advancing, Russia is also helping them. To make these statements look believable, Kiev itself arranges daily cannonades, and civilians of the LPR and DPR suffer.\nIA Novorossiya: This cannot be another attempt to divert the attention of the inhabitants of Ukraine from the difficult situation inside the country to the war in the Donbass?\nA.L .: A political crisis has ripened in Ukraine itself - the country's leadership was not ready for such a challenge as the coronavirus, and therefore their covert games of seizing power began there. Just before the introduction of the emergency, Avakov made a keynote speech - he looked like a savior of the nation. And I had only one question: where will he get the money for everything he offers. There are practically no gold reserves in Ukraine since Poroshenko. He successfully extinguished some social challenges with them, not forgetting to enrich himself and enrich his associates. Printing money that is not backed up by anything will not lead to salvation from the crisis, it is the same as putting out a fire with gasoline.\nNow Ukraine is in such a vicissitude of the situation that self-destruction of the country is quite possible.\nIf the virus starts to rage, what will the residents of Ukraine do, who previously didn’t react so well to fellow citizens evacuated from China? The oblast will blame the oblast for a friend that it \"delivered\" patients to them, and the blame the city for the suburbs? It is clear that the authorities, unable to cope with the epidemic, will shift the blame on any circumstances and the population. That is why, in my opinion, armed structures have already appeared on the main routes of Ukraine, which are controlled by Avakov. If the situation is really bad, then this will allow Avakov to rob Ukraine and finally flee somewhere. It is clear that in his actions there is little independence and there are curators who tell him how to act. But at the same time, Avakov is far from being stupid and understands that if everything collapses, then he can remain under the ruins of the “building” that has been built since the “Maidan” in 2014.\nIn Ukraine, most likely, there will be a whirlpool of events, which every day will change the internal and external political situation. At the same time, attention from Europe and the USA will be weakened. But this does not mean that it will be weakened by Russia. As it was correctly noted, the border is open, and if necessary, medical assistance will be provided to the residents of Donbass. The question is who will die first - Ukraine or its curators. It’s clear that Russia is not weakening its attention - some hotheads in Ukraine want to cancel the Minsk Agreements quietly, but this will not work. It was clearly stated that they must be respected.

As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases around the world is nearing one million, more and more draconian measures limiting the basic freedoms (like the freedom of movement and freedom of speech) of citizens are being introduced under the pretext of the need to contain the pandemic.\nThese swift and unprecedented changes of the social-political system around the world give rise to concerns that the world will never return to the pre-COVID-19 state and ‘temporary measures’ imposed to ‘contain the COVID-19 threat’ may turn into our new reality.\nAs of April 2 morning, there have been 936,865 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 47,263 deaths around the world. The United States, Italy, Spain with 215,344, 110,574 and 104,118 cases respectively. At the same time, the death rate in Italy and Spain is much higher than in the United States. This high death rate (every 8.4th infected in Italy and every 11th infected in Spain) turned the countries into a center of fear fueled by mainstream media reports designed to generate hype and attract the viewers’ attention amid the developing crisis. Bare figures provided by media without any additional context contribute to the growth of fear among the audience and justify further restrictions and emergency measures to contain the pandemic.\nAt the same time, a more detailed look at the situation and commentaries by medical experts and scientists indicate that the real COVID-19 threat is lower than media paint it.\nThe global COVID-19 numbers are yet to overcome the average effect of influenza seasons in the United States only: 61,099 people died during the 2017-2018 season (an approximately 6-month period) and 34,157 – during the 2018-2019 season (another 6-month period).\nAs of April 2, the 2017-2018 influenza season killed 12 times more people in the United States than the current COVID-19 outbreak. The 2018-2019 influenza season killed approximately 7 times more people than the COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe sky-high COVID-19 death toll in Italy also could be a result of several contributing factors:\n1. A large part of COVID-19-infected people in Italy is constituted of older people (65yo+) that present severe underlying diseases and thus remain in the group of risk in the event of any new disease. The CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report study says that 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 80% of deaths associated with COVID-19 were among adults aged 65 years and older.\n2. According to the report by the Italian Ministry of Health, the 2019-2020 flu season, which was marked by an unusually warm weather, led to the deaths of fewer older Italians than average. In Italy’s northern cities that have borne the most part of Italy’s more than 12,000 deaths, overall mortality among people age 65 and over was 6% below a baseline from previous years. In central and southern Italy, the deaths were 3% below normal.\nThus, elderly people and those with severe underlying diseases who were spared death by the flu and mild weather from November through January became an outsize target for the COVID-19 outbreak in February and March.\nThe drop in deaths from the 2019-2020 flu season led to an increase in the pool of the most vulnerable people for COVID-19. Therefore, this part of the Italians found themselves exposed to COVID-19 starting from the end of February, and that may have contributed to an increase in the impact of the epidemic on the elderly.\nThe Association of Epidemiologists says that the total number of elderly dead in Italy because of the COVID-19 outbreak exceeded the mortality rate from influenza over the past two years, but this figure still has not reached the mortality rate three years ago.\nThe Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency and research institute responsible for disease control and prevention, confirms the aforementioned facts. In the report released on April 1, the Robert Koch Institute says that 86% of deaths occurred in persons aged 70 years or older.\nAs of April 2, there have been 77,981 COVID-19 cases and 931 COVID-19-related deaths in Germany. In comparison, the 2017-2018 influenza season affected 9,000,000 people (they requested medical aid) and led to 25,1000 deaths.\nIgor Alekseevich Gundarov, a Doctor of Medicine, professor, member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, a specialist in the field of epidemiology and medical statistics, notes that the new coronavirus expansion may be linked with the previous successes in the field of combating the flu.\nThe new virus simply filled the created vacuum in the virus micro world that surrounds humanity. According to Gundarov, the current crisis, which caused the pandemic of fear additionally to the COVID-19 pandemic, is the result of the specific media coverage and political-motivated decisions of particular actors.\nEven countries that are almost not affected impose strict measures and limit freedoms of their citizens due to the COVID-19 outbreak. A curious situation is developing inside Russia. As of April 2, there were 3,548 COVID-19 cases that led 30 deaths only.\nThere is no official data showing some kind of dramatic spread of the disease. All people that died from the COVID-19 outbreak are elderly or/and people with the severe underlying diseases (cancer, severe forms of diabetes, heart diseases, etc.):\n- A man of unknown age, who died in St. Petersburg, and it was discovered that he had COVID-19 due to a post-mortem test;\n- An 84-year-old woman in Moscow, who suffered diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma and cardiovascular diseases;\n- A 48-year-old-man in Vladimir region. He died on March 27th from pneumonia, he had a chronic illness and was hospitalized into the general department of the hospital in Kovrovo, it was discovered he had COVID-19 in a post-mortem test;\n- A 52-year-old man in Pskov, he had severe underlying conditions in his lungs, but also COVID-19;\n- A 90-year-old man in Moscow. He was suffering from chronic cerebral ischemia, encephalopathy and parkinsonism;\n- A 69-year-old woman in Moscow for whom there is no other information;\n- A 57-year-old man in Orenburg, who had several chronic conditions;\n- A 73-year-old man in St. Petersburg, who returned from Thailand on March 1st. He suffered from several chronic conditions, including coronary heart disease and chronic heart failure, he died of acute heart failure, but had COVID-19, so he was registered as a victim of the virus;\n- A 56-year-old woman in Moscow. One of her lungs had been extracted previously due to cancer, she was confirmed with a left-sided pneumonia when admitted to hospital;\n- A 70-year-old woman in Moscow. She suffered from diabetes for 20 years, had terminal renal failure and other underlying conditions, she was registered as a COVID-19 victim;\n- An 88-year-old man in Moscow, with several underlying conditions;\n- A 73-year-old man in Moscow, also with several underlying conditions;\n- A 75-year-old male in Penza with numerous chronic diseases;\n- Three 76 – 86 years old people in Moscow. All patients had chronic diseases, in particular cardiovascular. Chronic pyelonephritis, bronchial asthma, chronic brain ischemia were also among concomitant diseases. Two of the patients suffered from diabetes;\n- A 65-year-old woman in the Moscow region. She had diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and suffered a heart attack in 2019;\n- Three 63-72 years old people in Moscow. All patients had concomitant diseases, including cardiovascular;\n- An 82-year-old woman in Chechnya;\n- Five people of 61 – 74 years old. All patients had concomitant diseases, including cardiosclerosis, hypertension and diabetes mellitus;\n- A 59-year-old man in the Moscow region. He had chronic diseases of the cardiovascular system, kidneys and liver;\n- A 45-year-old man in Pskov. Before being infected with COVID-19, he was diagnosed with lung disease;\n- A 48-year-old main in Perm. He had severe oncological problems.\nIn response to the situation, on March 30, Moscow (official population – over 13 million, estimated – up to 18 million) was put under mandatory lockdown. Under the rules, people would be allowed to only leave home for medical emergencies or to buy groceries or medication and only from the nearest shops and pharmacies. People can still leave the capital, and go to work (if this is needed). People are restricted to an area within 100m of their home. The authorities also plan to introduce a “smart control system,” after which residents will not be allowed to leave their homes without permits.\nOn April 2, Moscow mayor Sergey Sobyanin announced administrative fines for violations of the regime of ‘self-isolation’ in the city. The document (a law of Moscow city) was published on the mayor’s official website. The law provides for a fine for violators of up to 5,000 rubles (~ 65 USD), and for organizations – up to 500,000 rubles (6,410 USD). Meanwhile, in another Russian region, Krasnadar Krai, a fine for violators of the regime of ‘self-isolation’ is 15,000 rubles (~192 USD) and more.\nLocal authorities justified the move with the need to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak and minimize possible damage from people that violate the regime of self-isolation and other important anti-pandemic measures. This is an important task. However, under the Constitution, local authorities do not have the right to introduce such restrictions.\nIn the following few days, several other Russian regions introduced measures of this kind. Some of them even entered a mandatory regime of ‘administrative self-isolation’.\nFor example, the Republic of Chechnya announced that it is closing its administrative borders from April 5.\nThe Republic of Crimea announced a regime of self-isolation from April 3, establishing a checkpoint on the bridge with the mainland where all people entering and leaving the Republic are checked.\nThe Republic of Tatarstan overcame even Moscow. The regime of self-isolation was introduced there on April 1. People there can leave their homes only for emergency medical care, or in cases of a direct threat to their lives, visit the closest shop to buy food and other essential products, walking pets (100m from home) and move their trash to the nearest place of accumulation of waste. People can leave home for a longer distance and for a longer time only under a special permission received via a special SMS service.\nMeanwhile, the government is imposing severe punishments for spreading false information about the coronavirus and breaking quarantine rules as most regions have gone into lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus. The legislation was approved by both houses of the Parliament on March 31 and signed by President Vladimir Putin on April 1.\nHere is a brief overview of the new measures prepared by The Moscow Times:\nWhat happens if you’re convicted of breaking quarantine rules?\n— You will be fined up to 40,000 rubles ($640). Companies and public officials face fines of up to 150,000 rubles ($2,400), while legal entities face fines of up to half a million rubles ($7,900).\n— If the violation causes health issues or death, you will be fined up to 300,000 rubles ($4,800). Companies and public officials will be fined up to half a million rubles and 1 million rubles, respectively.\n— In what Russia’s consumer protection watchdog has said applies only to legal entities and public officials, quarantine dodging can also result in up to two years in prison.\n— If the violation causes one death, prison terms increase to up to five years.\n— If the violation causes two or more deaths, flouting quarantine rules results in prison terms of up to seven years.\nWhat happens if you’re convicted of spreading false information about Covid-19?\n— Under one amendment, you will be jailed for up to three years “for threatening people’s lives and safety” with false information. You will also be fined up to 700,000 rubles ($11,200).\n— Under the other amendment, you will be jailed for up to five years “for distributing deliberately false information of public significance” if it leads to death or “other grave consequences.” You will also be fined up to 2 million rubles ($32,000).\nWho can declare an emergency situation?\n— Putin, and now the cabinet of ministers. In addition to the stiffer fines and long jail terms, lawmakers have rushed through bills that grant the Russian government the authority to enact a nationwide state of emergency or “high-alert regime.”\n— The Kremlin said it supported expanding the government’s emergency powers. Putin has been criticized for falling short of declaring a national emergency or imposing lockdown rules similar to those now in place across U.S., European and other cities.\nThe measures approved by the Federal Government demonstrate that the Russian leadership fully understand the threat of fake news attacks and foreign-instigated panic, as well as treats seriously destructive actions of separate persons and organizations that intentionally ignore the anti-pandemic measures.\nOn the other hand, the ‘administrative self-isolation’ measures employed by some regions contribute to the de-facto fragmentation of the Russian Federation and the introduction of Orwellian control measures over people living in the key regions, like Moscow, the Moscow region and the Republic of Tatarstan. These actions of regional authorities violate both the Russian Constitution and the federal laws.\nThe spreading regime of ‘administrative self-isolation’ in the Russian regions seems to have been initiated by some of the regional elites (i.e.not by the federal center or Putin and his team). The way that the heads of particular regions are acting makes it look like they are implementing pre-planned actions aimed at dramatically increasing their own political power and wresting authority away from the central government.\nThe central government enables this behavior under the pressure of the media and political hysteria around the world or remains misinformed about the real situation.\nAll of these developments came in a very sensitive time for Russia, which is now passing through the constitutional reform and suffering from the dramatic fall of the oil prices. The imposed anti-COVID-19 measures also damage the local business and the job market throwing people out of their positions. In the event of the negative scenario, this may rapidly lead to the deterioration of the social and economic situation across the country.\nAuthorities say that introduced surveillance measures and limitations of freedoms will be canceled after the end of the COVID-19 outbreak. Nevertheless, the historical practice demonstrates that there is a nonzero probability that they will remain, or will be only partially lifted, even after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe specific of the Russian political culture, a complex tangle of contradictions within the Russian regional and federal elites, as well as the fact that a significant part of the Russian elites is affiliated with the collective West contribute to this scenario.\nTherefore, the developments triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to the deformation of the political and administrative structure of the Russian Federation, and lead to notable social and economic tensions. If this scenario turns into reality, the stability of the entire Eurasian region will be undermined.\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n- How Did The “Three Little Piglets” Prepare For The “Wolf”: Russia, U.S., China’s Response To COVID-19\n- Pandemic Of Fear\nDonate"}, {"url": "https://afaq.tv/contents/view/details?id=124126", "title": "A former Trump adviser accuses Bill Gates of spreading Corona", "text": "A former Trump adviser accuses Bill Gates of spreading Corona\nThursday 16 April 2020:\n04:05 pm\n168\nRoger Stone suggested on Monday that Bill Gates might have had a hand in creating\nCorona virus and pandemic spread all over the world.\nThe former adviser to Donald Trump noted that the American billionaire,\nBill Gates, he probably did so that he could grow electronic chips\nThe minute in people's heads to distinguish between those who were tested for Coved 19 and did not\nTest it.\nStone spoke to Joe Pescobo, the presenter of the radio show (The Lancer), on\nAM 970 waves, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic:\n\"Whether Bill Gates played a role in creating and spreading this virus,\nThis is open to serious discussion. \"\nHe added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to grow chips\nMicro in people and the imposition of mandatory vaccinations.\nAccording to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is linked to his plan\nThe alleged cultivation of electronic chips in people that contain\nCompulsory vaccinations.\nStone, who was sentenced to 40 months in prison for his actions during a campaign, opposed\nTrump's 2016 election, high probability of mandatory vaccinations.\nGates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis, such as\nCorona virus, to the point of a recent spread about Gates's prediction of the disease before 3\nYears\nAs the Washington Times reported, Gates announced earlier this\nThe month that his charitable organization will invest billions of dollars in its factories\nIt will focus on developing several vaccines.\nChannel translation\nhorizons\nSource:\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/14/roger-stone-boosts-conspiracy-theory-blaming-bill-/\nLeave your comment\nNote: Kindly, the comment is subject to management review before publication."}, {"url": "https://wafaamagazine.org/archives/76766", "title": "The mystery of the virus that slept 5 years ...

How and why could mankind’s progress reverse in this way? Recent experience has eliminated the mystery. No special devastating event was needed; the cause of Rome's demise was simply the loss of its people's desire to support their ‘empire’ and its underlying values. And as it was 1,500 years or so ago, so I fear it is now.\nThe Covid-19 crisis – specifically, the reaction to it – demonstrates that people have grown bored, detached, and easily impressionable by things that have nothing to do with the roots of their society. We are all – or too many of us – fin de siècle Romans now.\nA large number of Westerners are happy to accept the suicidal shutting down of their economies to try to halt a virus that predominantly causes old and sick people to die just a few weeks or months before they would have anyway. Just as they enthusiastically endorse proclamations such as that there are 46 sexes, not two; that the flatulence of a cow must be reduced to save a polar bear; that millions of migrants from the Third World must be invited to Europe and assumed to be neurosurgeons; and so on.\nThe widespread opinion that everything, including economies, must be sacrificed to beat coronavirus is a revival of medieval witch hunts; the sacrifice seems more important than finding an effective method to deal with the problem.\nOur increasingly decadent mass culture has gradually become more ideological and openly opposed to the values Western civilization is based upon. And while it boasts of being ‘counter-culture’ and independent, it’s acquired a monopoly over almost all the information channels that determine opinions, including mainstream media and political parties.\nGovernments are stepping in to pay wages and fund other services. As tax revenue will be virtually non-existent, public debt will soar. Some governments may default on their debts or resort to printing money, causing soaring inflation. These countries may be unable to fund healthcare, their police or their military, and be so weakened they will be invaded by others and be erased from the world map.\nThat may be a worst-case scenario, but it’s almost certain that the impact of the shutdowns will be a recession comparable to the Great Depression. Yet what do most Western citizens make of it? Well, they are either unaware, uncaring, or they’re happy about it. They don’t seem to appreciate the consequent dangers. Instead, they are more obsessed with the latest celebrity who’s caught the virus.\nThe consumers of this mass culture haven't built anything like what our ancestors did – enlightenment, the theory of relativity, parliamentary democracy, industrialisation, major advances in philosophy, science, literature and engineering. They don't have to defend any real values against a tangible enemy, because hiding in a herd with uniform group-think is good enough for them.\nOur ancestors had difficult, short lives; they had to work hard, produce enough to survive, fight enemies, and defend what they’d inherited. Numerous lasting values emerged from those efforts. The current generations of Westerners are good only at producing and escalating irrationality and panic.\nIf a two-month lockdown isn’t deemed enough to contain the virus, they’re happy to extend it to six months, if not years. China decided to impose strict policies, but they were assertive enough to be relatively short-lived; many Westerners want less perfect policies to last for a much longer time. That’s clearly an irrational approach; instead of ‘flattening a curve’, rational leaders (like Beijing’s) try to turn the curve into a cliff. The faster you eliminate the virus, the cheaper it is.\nThis support for economically suicidal policies didn't start with Covid-19. Westerners have spent recent decades amid a prosperity in which they took material wealth and good healthcare for granted. They forgot what hunger (and, in most cases, unemployment) meant. They got used to demanding ever deeper ‘entitlements’, such as the ‘right not to be offended’.\nActivists sensationalised smaller and more implausible threats and demanded that governments mitigated them. In particular, the climate change movement advocated that the 1-2 °C of warming caused by CO2 emissions in a century was equivalent to an armageddon that had to be avoided, whatever the cost.\nIn this context, it could be expected that the first ‘real challenge’ – and a new flu-like disease is certainly one – would make people fearful. Because if people were led to believe that 1-2 °C of warming was basically the end of the world, is it surprising that they're absolutely terrified of a new disease that has the potential to kill a few million old and sick people?\nThe existential threat posed by coronavirus – or at least, our irrationality towards it – is greater than the climate threat (though still very small). Westerners who haven't seen any real threats for a long time have developed a condition – termed \"affluenflammation\" by the American musician Remy – which is a pathological habit of inflating negligible threats. When this inflation of feelings is applied to a real threat, namely a pandemic, they lose their composure.\nThe context of Covid-19, where every death is presented with horror, makes it clear that ‘immortality’ is just another ‘human right’. This wisdom says that our leaders are failing because they cannot defend this so-called right. But this excessive sensitivity is just one part of the problem.\nMany Westerners actively want to harm their economies, corporations, rich people, and governments, because they don't feel any attachment to or responsibility for them. They take security and prosperity for granted. Their money and food arrive from ‘somewhere’, and they don’t care about the source.\nAnd they believe that the structures which allow them to survive – the governments, banks, and so on – are ‘evil’. Some are just financially illiterate. But others know what they are saying, and rejoice in demanding that trillions be sacrificed in order to infinitesimally increase the probability that a 90-year-old will avoid infection and live a little bit longer. They don't accept their dependence on society and the system at all. They don't realise that their moral values, their ‘human rights’, are only available if paid for by prosperous societies.\nI have used some dramatic prose, so let me be clear: the scenario I’ve outlined – ending in the suicide of the West – is avoidable, and I hope and believe it will be. I know some who are willing to fight for its survival.\nBut even if this acceleration towards shutdowns is reversed and countries restore their pre-virus businesses, our world won't be the same. Many people will conclude that the crisis was exciting, and try to kickstart a repetition. The curfew is likely to reduce CO2 emissions this year, so climate activists may try for similar results in the future. Terrorists may deploy some new disease – which, after all, is likely to be more effective than any stabbing or bombing.\nIt's conceivable that the West’s brush with mortality will lead people to regain some common sense and survival instincts. Perhaps several nations going bankrupt will be a wake-up call. Maybe people will realise that the reaction to the coronavirus was disproportionate. But even if that is so, I’m afraid it won’t be enough.\nWe need to accept that the positive relationship of Westerners to the roots of their civilization will be still missing – and that this is a virus that poses a much more fundamental existential threat than Covid-19.\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!"}, {"url": "https://ukraina.ru/news/20200226/1026837506.html", "title": "Suspected coronavirus.

But it soon became clear that no one forced the Ukrainian authorities to make such a decision. The IMF has long removed from the agenda the mandatory adoption of a law on the sale of land.\nAnd the other day, IMF Permanent Representative in Ukraine Yosta Lyungman thanked the Ukrainian authorities for the adoption by the Verkhovna Rada of the first reading of the law banning the return of banks and passed on the next requirements for obtaining a loan. Ukrainian deputies are to adopt a banking law in the second reading and finally remove the opportunity for the oligarch Kolomoisky to return his main asset, the country's largest bank, PrivatBank.\nIn addition, the Rada should try once again to adopt changes to the state budget for 2020 in connection with the coronavirus pandemic, because during the March 30 vote, there were not enough votes to decide.\nAnd ... not a word about the earth. Thus it turns out - the IMF was only interested in the banking sector.\nBut why did the president of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky hurry up with the land law so much that he even violated the rules by making deputies vote at an extraordinary meeting?\nAn indicative fact - during the vote Zelensky allied with ex-president Petro Poroshenko. And a couple of days later, in a surprising way, the prosecution was closed against Poroshenko.\nThe answer is simple. In addition to the International Monetary Fund, the Ukrainian authorities borrow from George Soros. It was Soros who needed fertile Ukrainian chernozems, and he forced two Ukrainian politicians to join forces and give him Ukrainian land.\nBut Soros may not save Zelensky from the coup, which is inexorably approaching. And only the coronavirus pandemic so far saves the Ukrainian president from the Maidan and gives him valuable time for staff purges in law enforcement agencies.\nThroughout the past week, Ukrainian intelligence services have been storming. Most of the employees who came to the service under Poroshenko were removed from their posts or dismissed.\nNo less serious changes occurred in the General Prosecutor of Ukraine. Employees associated with the former head of the presidential administration, Andrei Bogdan, the protege of the oligarch Igor Kolomoisky, and the former Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuriy Lutsenko, the protege of Petro Poroshenko, were fired.\nIn recent days, serious personnel changes and delineation of powers in the Armed Forces of Ukraine have occurred.\nThe purges did not concern only the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which was completely controlled by the Minister of Power Arsen Avakov.\nZelensky hurries to defend himself against a power change in the country. The sponsor of the presidential campaign Zelensky, Igor Kolomoisky, was betrayed by him to please Soros. But Soros is far away, and the angry oligarch is very close, and is not going to retreat.\nWhat trump cards does Kolomoisky have? First of all, his existing good relations with the Minister of Internal Affairs Avakov, as well as with the authorities of the key cities of Ukraine - Kharkov and Odessa. The Kiev authorities can be added to this alliance, given the established relations between Klitschko and Avakov.\nThe main force of the alliance is the armed nationalist units that went through the war in Donbass. Many militants currently serve with Avakov in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, either in the Municipal Guard near Klitschko, or in private security structures near Kolomoisky. Do not write off the political resources of Kolomoisky and Avakov in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.\nAnd the banner of future unrest, it seems, will be the comrade-in-arms of Kolomoisky and Avakova, the leader of the Fatherland party, Yulia Tymoshenko, who has already managed to accuse Zelensky of betraying the homeland.\nVladimir Zelensky should seriously fear his own circle, which sees a sharp weakening of the president’s position, and is ready to support the oligarch Kolomoisky in his planned confrontation with the head of state.\nAttempts by the president of Ukraine to establish relations with Rinat Akhmetov and other oligarchs could end in disastrous outcome for him. During the removal of Zelensky from power, big business will observe and support the one who will win.\nThose who once removed President Yanukovych from power by arranging the Maidan will return to power. Zelensky sees this, understands and desperately tries to protect himself, but few believe that he will succeed.\nMost likely, events in Ukraine will develop according to the most shocking scenario. The country alone will not cope with the epidemic of coronavirus, and the socio-economic and political crisis will lead to the \"collapse\" of collapse.\nBy order of President Zelensky, the Armed Forces of Ukraine significantly increased shelling of the population of Donbass, flagrantly violating the current ceasefire agreement. In the last week, the Armed Forces of Ukraine increased targeted fire from heavy weapons of residential buildings, schools, and ruined the infrastructure of the republics. So Vladimir Zelensky is trying to find support from the military and mercenaries earning in the war.\nBut the coronavirus pandemic has already begun to mow the ranks of the Ukrainian army at a catastrophic rate, which has created a panic in the Armed Forces. Soldiers arbitrarily leave their units and desert, hoping to escape from the epidemic. Most APU holidaymakers did not return on time to the location of the unit. Military personnel who are being treated in hospitals are simply fleeing home.\nThe shortage of personnel is so strong that Zelensky, through his advisers, is forced to turn to a number of paramilitary nationalist organizations with a request to urgently patch holes in the Armed Forces, naturally for a good material reward.\nThanks to a source from the medical service of the Vostok operational-tactical group, statistical information was obtained on the situation with the pandemic in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces as of March 31, 2020.\n10 separate mountain assault brigade - 47 infected (7 heavy), 1 died.\n57 separate motorized infantry brigade - 135 infected (24 heavy), 3 died.\n128 separate mountain assault brigade - 201 infected (33 heavy), 4 died.\n35 separate marine brigade - 62 infected (12 heavy), 2 died.\n36 separate brigade of the marine corps - 51 infected (8 heavy), 2 died.\n28 separate mechanized brigade - 227 infected (36 heavy), 6 died.\n92 separate mechanized brigades - 196 infected (29 heavy), 5 died.\n79 separate air assault brigade - 37 infected (6 heavy), 1 died.\n72 separate mechanized brigade - 165 infected (23 heavy), 4 died.\n93 separate mechanized brigades - 184 infected (19 heavy), 4 died.\nTotal, according to the OTG Vostok medical group, in March 2020, APU losses from coronavirus amounted to:\n1305 infected.\n197 in intensive care.\n30 passed away.\nAnd this is according to the recorded data. And how much in reality, given the severe shortage of test systems?\nOver the past two days, the number of infected has increased exactly twice, compared with the entire March period.\nThe policy of silence pursued by the President of Ukraine Zelensky and the General Staff of the Armed Forces failed.\nOver the past two weeks, the coronavirus has mowed out advanced Ukrainian units and formations in the war zone. Among the personnel of the Armed Forces, panic and mistrust of command prevail.\nAccording to the military medical personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the OSO headquarters ordered the losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from the coronavirus to be attributed to “the actions of the militants of the Ordlo” and non-combat losses (careless handling of weapons, accidents).\nThere has been a sharp decrease in volunteer assistance to high school students. The situation with the supply of military units with food, antiviral drugs and protective equipment has come to a standstill.\nDue to the introduction of quarantine, food suppliers proposed to revise the cost of purchasing goods in favor of an increase and temporarily stopped deliveries to the war zone. In this connection, food rations were substantially cut by the military. A lack of quality drinking water has led to outbreaks in military units of dysentery and intestinal diseases.\nThe Armed Forces General Staff ordered to deploy additional field hospitals in a number of regions of southeast Ukraine as soon as possible.\nIn the territories of Donbass occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, hospitals are crowded with infected people. Doctors refuse to help the high school students, quit or just run away from work.\nThe other day, the medical staff of hospital number 8 in the occupied APU Mariupol in full force filed a letter of resignation. The reason for this was the lack of personal protective equipment, the lack of test systems for detecting coronavirus infection, and the lack of places in hospitals due to hospitalization of about 200 Ukrainian troops infected with coronavirus in a medical facility.\nAgainst the background of the Ukrainian epidemiological catastrophe in the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics, clear and well-coordinated work is ongoing in the framework of the fight against coronavirus.\nThe republics of Donbass closed their borders immediately after Russia and began to carry out all the necessary quarantine actions and restrictions, coordinating them with Russian colleagues. That is why, the only states with which Russia has not closed the border are the LPR and the DPR.\nThis decision of the Russian government indicates a high level of preparation of both the population and the doctors of Donbass for the epidemic.\nToday in the republics there is not a single person who has died, and only a few are infected who have been hospitalized for treatment.\nRussia regularly provides the republic with medicines, antiviral drugs and medical masks.\nIn addition, Donbass has its own pharmaceutical companies - the Gorlovsky Stirolbiofarm and the Lugansk pharmaceutical factory, which since the Soviet era has been producing cheap chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide.\nThanks to Russia's support, the Donbass is successfully coping with the pandemic.\nVladimir Karasev is an international political scientist.\nComments\nYeah, we saw this \"guilty.\" Here recently, at a Solovyov’s show, a Hohlyatsky “political scientist” Vasil Vakarov, when asked why Ukraine would not ask Russia for help in the fight against coronovirus, replied: “Russia annexed Crimea, thereby turning Ukrainians against itself.

This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans.\nResearchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than previously thought.\"\nOn the other hand, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify \"potential risks\".\nSimon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: \"If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.\"\nIn 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focused specifically on \"job promotion\", especially those causing serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans."}, {"url": "https://alhadeel.net/article/97298", "title": "A former Minister of Health praises the measures taken to limit the spread of Corona", "text": "A former Minister of Health praises the measures taken to limit the spread of Corona\nThe former Minister of Health, Muhammad Jawad Khalifa, considered that the Corona virus is dangerous and should be treated with caution, noting the measures taken in Lebanon to date to combat the spread of the epidemic.\nKhalifa, in an interview with \"The Voice of All Lebanon\", stressed the importance of continuing the preventive measures and the rules of social divergence even if it was said that we are close to overcoming the virus, pointing out that the greatest danger today is in cases that come from abroad, especially from the countries of America and Europe.\nKhalifa said that the general mobilization procedures cannot go on forever because the price of treating the disease cannot be more severe than the disease itself."}, {"url": "https://elhmra.com/article-63445", "title": "British Boxer Amir Khan: Corona Virus Linked to \"5G\" Network Test", "text": "The British boxer, Amir Khan, believes that the reality of the spread of Corona virus emerging from China is false, and is related to testing the new generation telecommunications network \"5G\".\nAmir Khan said via Instagram: \"I don't think the virus came from China.

However, neither the place, nor the time, nor the agenda of the meeting has been agreed yet.\nHumanity is divided in the face of threats\nThe Russian leader proposed holding a summit, speaking in Jerusalem on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Holocaust. He expressed serious concern about the \"fragmentation of the world in the face of threats.\"\n“The issues of strategic stability are part of the agenda that requires urgent and extraordinary steps. More broadly, we are talking about the survival of mankind,” said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in turn.\nIn terms of content and drama, these statements resemble the initiatives of the Soviet government in the second half of the 30s. The USSR then insisted on a joint curbing of the aggressor and the creation of a collective security system for this. The West did not heed the Soviet leadership. As a result, the world slid into World War II, and only at its end did the Yalta-Potsdam system arise, within which we supposedly still live.\nIt’s supposedly that we live, since the de facto mechanisms of the Yalta-Potsdam system have not been working for a long time. After the collapse of the USSR, the United States spontaneously, explicitly revised the mechanisms for regulating international relations. Sometimes the modern system is called the post-Yalta system, since formally all international organizations provided for by the Yalta-Potsdam accords are in force, and none of them are infringed on their rights. In fact, Washington himself decides which decisions of international organizations he and his allies should implement and which not. The states that oppose the American dictatorship, their leaders and international organizations face at least sanctions, in the worst case, obstinate leaders are arrested on far-fetched occasions, and overly independent states are subjected to \"humanitarian bombing\" of the United States.\nThe world fell into a systemic crisis\nWe live in a world whose global economy is based on the Washington consensus (the era of the Washington consensus is another common name for the post-Yalta era). Politically, the dominance of the economic model of the Washington Consensus is ensured by the global hegemony of the United States.\nRather, that was until recently. But the return of Crimea right under the nose of the Americans who were already preparing to master it, ousting the United States from Syria, ineffective sanctions against Russia, Washington’s inability to force China to comply with its political and economic demands, a split of elites in the US and the EU, ongoing economic conflicts between America and The European Union - all this has demonstrated that American hegemony is ending.\nAnd without the political hegemony of the United States, pursuing the economic policy of the Washington Consensus is impossible.\nThe world fell into a systemic crisis. The hardest hit (including economically) is in the United States and the West as a whole, as the main beneficiaries of the crumbling Washington consensus. When and in what state the Western countries will come out of the crisis and whether they are in full force is not known to anyone. This is superimposed on an epidemic of coronavirus, which at another time, humanity would not have not noticed, but would have survived without much upheaval, and economic losses, for all their enormity, would not be critical.\nBut in the context of the epidemic imposing on the systemic crisis, when resources are already scarce, and here they must be spent on overcoming the epidemic and its consequences, the basis of globalism, the mythical unity of the West, began to crumble. Western countries began to not only be quarantined from each other, but slid into a completely egoistic policy. They refuse to help their EU partners with medical supplies and financial support. The economies of the EU states are losing sectors working for unity (tourism, joint production - the supply of components from quarantine zones through closed borders is now far from guaranteed). The United States conducted a whole military operation to export from Italy half a million tests for coronavirus, which Italy itself lacks. The West is immersed in the classical Middle Ages, where everyone is for himself and everything is against everyone. And the longer the epidemic shakes him, the deeper he will plunge there.\nWill we build a new world?\nIf the old world ends, it is necessary to agree on the rules of a \"beautiful new world.\" Actually, this was suggested by Vladimir Putin.\nA new system of international relations can be established either following the results of world wars (as it was in 1914-1918 and 1939-1945), or on the basis of a general compromise that will allow avoiding a military conflict that threatens the death of all mankind.\nIt is not known whether the summit of the \"five\" UN Security Council will take place in the fall - or later. In any case, it’s worth waiting until the results of the damage caused to the West by the epidemic become clear, the results of the oil (and I would say energy, because gas too) war, and also see how deep the Western exchanges will fall during the current stage of the global systemic crisis.\nAnd after it becomes clear who exactly survived this fascinating struggle, it will be possible to decide with whom and what it is worth talking about.\nThe only positive thing here is that it seems that the overlap of the systemic crisis, the crisis of hydrocarbon prices and the coronavirus pandemic can replace us with a new world war, acting as a \"forest nurse\" and rejecting non-viable political entities.\nThe opinion of the author may not coincide with the point of view of the editors"}, {"url": "https://www.timesofps.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1/%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A/4459/%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B3-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%A3%D8%A9-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7/", "title": "New theory: Bill Gates behind the origins and spread of the Coronavirus", "text": "Roger Stone, the former adviser to US President Donald Trump, said on Monday that Bill Gates may have had a hand in creating the Coronavirus and spreading the pandemic throughout the world.\nStone pointed out that the American billionaire, Bill Gates, may have done so to be able to cultivate microchips in people's heads to distinguish who was tested for Covid-19 and not tested.\nStone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: “Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate.”\nHe added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to sow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations.\nAccording to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is related to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain \"mandatory vaccinations.\"\nStone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations.\nGates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis such as coronaviruses, to the extent of recent talk about Gates's prediction of the disease 3 years ago.\nThe Washington Times also reported that Gates announced earlier this month that his charitable organization would invest billions of dollars in factories that would focus on developing many vaccines."}, {"url": "https://katehon.com/ar/article/lnzm-lmryd-zm-lnzm-llmy-fy-zl-jyh-kwrwn", "title": "Sick System: The Global Order Crisis Under Corona's Pandemic", "text": "Sick System: The Crisis of the Global Order Under the Corona Pandemic\nThe Corona pandemic that struck the global system since December 2019 is one of the most important crises in the twenty-first century, but it outweighs its threat to the stability and continuity of the system what was formed by the global financial crisis of 2008, as Corona not only affected human bodies, but also affected the ideology of the global system after The Cold War and brought it into intensive care as well as thousands of citizens around the world.\nThe pandemic has revealed a flaw in the (neoliberal) ideology of the global system since the end of the Cold War, which is the inability of advanced economic systems to cope with and contain the spread of the virus through weak measures that followed, as well as poor health infrastructure and poor response to the risks of the crisis. The impact of the pattern of thinking about the economic benefit of the leaders of these countries to delay the quarantine procedures for fear that these measures lead to economic losses, as the pandemic spread in Europe led to the absence of the European vocabulary and integration vocabulary to be replaced by the vocabulary of sovereignty, state and security As for the closed borders policies, instead of the open borders policies that prevailed among the European Union countries were replaced by the European integration system, there was no longer any importance to the Schengen regime that prevails among the European countries, which constituted a major blow to the liberal ideology with its classic and new forms based on freedom of movement. Trade and the removal of obstacles and border restrictions, which the European Union is the most important model applied.\nThe behavior of European countries towards each other seemed more statist towards the spread of the epidemic at the expense of the values of European cooperation and integration, as Germany and France closed the borders to the countries where the infections appeared, Italy and Spain, and they did not agree to grant them urgent aid to stop the spread of the epidemic, and the evidence for that It is the statements of Italian Prime Minister (Giuseppe Conte) who warned that the European Union might \"lose its reason for existence\" in the event of \"committing\" tragic options \"in the fight against Corona virus as he expected a great depression that could hit the European Union countries, as he said during a session of the European Council in 26/3/2020 saw a confrontation \"I represent a country that suffers a lot, and I cannot allow myself to delay,\" which reveals the bitterness of the reality that Italy is going through, the reality of the spread of the epidemic and the failure of friends.\nThe position of Spain, which is the second largest victim in Europe from the epidemic after Italy, did not differ greatly, as Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez warned that \"the future of the European Union will be at stake\", if the regional system fails to take a unified stance to deal with the outbreak of the new Corona virus, which It caused great damage to some of the European Union countries, such as Italy and Spain, and Sanchez also called on European countries to implement a new plan aimed at reducing the burden on the countries most affected, and easing the next blow due to the decline in economic activities, in Europe in particular and the world in general.\nThe situation was not different on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. In the United States, what mattered most to Trump was his fear that the closure would lead to a decline in the economic gains calculated for his administration and which he had achieved in the past years. Until the epidemic became the largest epidemic in the world, this was accompanied by the inability of the American health system to contain and treat injuries.\nThe crisis of the virus has also led to the emergence of the phenomenon of piracy of medical equipment between countries. Spain complained about Turkey’s seizure of a cargo plane carrying medical equipment on its way to Spain, and France, Germany and Canada complained of similar American piracy on shipments of medical masks. Countries have bought them from China and have been taken over by the United States of America, which reflects the emergence of new and unconventional behavior by a number of countries influencing international relations.\nInstead of the major capitalist countries rescuing Italy and Spain at a time when the epidemic broke out, they attacked China and Russia and criticized them for the rescue and medical aid they provide to Italy and Spain, claiming that this aid is to strengthen Chinese soft power and accusing China of spreading the epidemic.\nAnd it seems that they resorted to these accusations after their failure to contain the virus was revealed, as China did. The leaders of the major countries feared that China's success in containing the epidemic, as well as providing medical assistance and expertise to a number of affected countries, including European countries, Italy and Spain, would lead to fear that it would work. This aid as a soft power in favor of China leads to the demolition of the confidence of the citizens of Western countries with their governments, and this was stated by Western leaders who accused China of using the epidemic to achieve gains in its soft power and improving its image in the world. Therefore, they quickly accused China of spreading the virus as the President described Donald Trump Korna b (Chinese Virus) in a press statement to him, which escalated racial discrimination against the Chinese as the Western media launched an attack on China and Chinese food habits being the reason for the emergence of the virus, a campaign aimed at undermining China's efforts to export the international system, which is likely To emerge from this crisis as a superpower, which indicates the possibility of a transfer of power in the international system from the West to the East after the Corona crisis.\nAll these events invite us to think again about the value of the prevailing international system, which is dominated by neoliberal ideology, which limits the authority of the state and enhances the prospects for integration and cooperation between countries. Humanity, as the crisis has strengthened the influence of populist parties in Western countries, which are calling for more national sovereignty for their countries in the face of prevailing integration policies and strengthening measures that limit freedom of movement and movement between national borders.\nIt also revealed to us that advanced systems have largely neglected the health sector in exchange for inflating military and defense budgets, this pandemic may push countries in the future to think about supporting scientific research and allocating large budgets to them, and that a new concept of security has become more urgent than ever before, which is security Epidemiology and biological deterrence to address the threat that future epidemics pose to states.\nIn this regard, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger indicated in his article on the Wall Street Journal, that the Corona virus will change the global system forever, as he stressed that the political and economic turmoil unleashed by Corona Virus may continue for many generations, and he indicated that the United States should put They consider facing the challenges of the disease locally and globally through three areas. The first is interest in developing scientific research, the second is addressing the potential economic damage caused by the outbreak of the virus, and the third is to preserve the principles of the liberal global system.\nThus, fundamental questions arise here, will the neoliberal world order recover again after the Corona crisis? Or will it turn into another pattern in which the national spirit and the principles of preserving state sovereignty and national security escalate again in conjunction with the rise of populist movements in Western civilization? Or will the world order falter in order to agree on forming a new system according to a new ideology that differs from the new liberal ideology? In light of the uncertainty and uncertainty that prevail in the world today regarding its future in the post-Corona period, the possibilities remain open to all scenarios."}, {"url": "https://sportnewsps.com/arab-news/amp/348301", "title": "New conspiracy theory: Bill Gates behind the genesis and spread of the Corona virus", "text": "New conspiracy theory: Bill Gates behind the origins and spread of the Coronavirus\nWednesday 15 April 2020 11:10 PM\n35 minutes ago 2,163\nThe Observatory newspaper: Roger Stone suggested on Monday that Bill Gates might have had a hand in creating the Corona virus and spreading the pandemic throughout the world.\nFormer Donald Trump adviser indicated that American billionaire Bill Gates might have done this so he could grow microchips in people's heads to distinguish who was tested for COVID-19 and not tested.\nStone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM waves, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: “Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate,” according to Russia today, citing the New York Post.\nElectronic chips\nHe added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to sow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations.\nAccording to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is related to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain \"mandatory vaccinations.\"\nStone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations.

The United States operates bio laboratories worldwide that deal with the production, distribution and control of biological warfare agents.\nThe corona virus has a firm grip on the world. After China and Iran were hit hard by the pandemic that had been going on since January, the panic about COVID-19 has already reached Europe. Hamster purchases, cancellations of major events, border controls and restricted areas make this clear. An economic crisis is predicted due to the lack of work and delivery bottlenecks. But is such a resistant flu virus still natural? If not, where does it come from?\nBetween 2017 and 2018, the Pentagon's bioweapons program was increasingly addressed in some media. Viruses such as swine flu, anthrax or SARS are said to come from the global bio laboratories that cooperate with the Pentagon. In total, there are said to be 25 organic laboratories that the Pentagon is supposed to run off from the outside world, most of them on the borders of Russia, China and Iran, i.e. where the alarm was most likely to be raised.\nSuch projects are rarely or not commented on officially. Reports and reports about the U.S. Department of Defense’s bio-weapons program are declared conspiracy theory, although all data about the questionable global bio-weapons program circulated on the Internet. Especially official documents from the DTRA.\nOn the basis of such documents (a large part has been deleted again), journalist Dilyana Gaythandzhieva began her research on biological warfare in the USA.\nThe #USArmy has been openly testing #Biological and #ChemicalWeapons since 2012 in direct violation of the UN conventions and must be subjected to international sanctions. 7 federal projects prove the offensive US military programs. pic.twitter.com/CHjdUdp9gi\n- Dilyana Gaytandzhieva (@dgaytandzhieva) March 3, 2018\nThe Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is a military service affiliated with the United States Department of Defense and employs more than 2,000 people. The laboratories allegedly serve to avert danger, but not to produce viruses. However, observers do not want to let the Americans into their laboratories, as Russia found out because the Kremlin did not want to be content with the alleged conspiracy theory.\n#Zakharova: We are concerned with the fact that for years, Washington has obstinately opposed developing a legally binding protocol to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention that would describe the convention’s verification procedure pic.twitter.com/rF7zoxitgC\n— MFA Russia 🇷🇺 (@mfa_russia) February 8, 2018\nSwine flu circulated in Ukraine in 2016, killing around 364 people, which was hardly relevant in the Western media at the time. It was equally irrelevant in the years that eleven of these laboratories are operated in Ukraine. Even when malaria broke out in Ukraine, it had little relevance in public reporting.\nIn 2018, for example, the Bulgarian journalist Dilyana Gaythandshieva popularized a report in the Russian-language media that dealt with the official documents, evaluated leaked e-mail traffic and did research in Georgia. Near Tbilisi is the Lugar Center, an organic laboratory operated by the DTRA. Particularly noteworthy was the fact that highly dangerous viruses were sent unchecked by diplomatic mail.\nUS diplomats involved in trafficking of human blood and pathogens for secret military program https://t.co/WSMvastPzf via @ArmsWatch_\n— Arms Watch (@ArmsWatch_) June 19, 2019\nThe Russian State Duma MP, Gennady Onishchenko, described the military microbiological laboratory in Georgia as a real threat to the entire region. \"This Georgian laboratory poses a real threat to security and human rights in Georgia, across the Caucasus and throughout the Black Sea region, which includes 12 countries, including Turkey, Russia and Ukraine,\" he said.\nAccording to him, the laboratory can work with viruses and microbes that pose a threat to all of humanity. Any possible accident in the facility, such as B. failure of ventilation can lead to disaster.\nDeadly tularemia outbreak in Sumy District, #Ukraine, close to the Pentagon-funded biolaboratory in Kharkiv, which is one of the 11 US-sponsored biolaboratories in the country https://t.co/fjpT7tLODV … pic.twitter.com/N2PZDcNmV6\n- Dilyana Gaytandzhieva (@dgaytandzhieva) March 17, 2019\nIn Iran it was announced last week that the fight against the virus had already been declared a military matter by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. From this point at the latest, research on the past three years is remembered, while the US bioweapons program was at least discussed in alternative media in Germany. However, some were quickly accused of China and Iran.\nOn Friday, reports spread over Iran that the virus would be carried out from there. Rumors against China are based on reports that the Chinese are said to be operating a bio-weapons program in Wuhan from where the virus is said to have spread unchecked. Everything that indicated the United States' bioweapons program was once again “pure conspiracy theory”.\nThe other three federal projects on #chemical and #biologicalwarfare agent testing at #DugwayProvingGround here: pic.twitter.com/kwzDm85Wfv\n- Dilyana Gaytandzhieva (@dgaytandzhieva) March 3, 2018\nAll of these revelations of recent years should always be brought to mind when Western media and politicians use the corona pandemic to pursue foreign policy. In other words: to blame countries like Russia, China or Iran for the spread.\nCurrently, however, the question of guilt or the cause does not keep the media world in check, but for weeks one breaking news has been chasing the other and more and more panic is spreading. In Germany, the government is trying to use the crisis for itself to suggest that the population can act. So far, however, without great success.\nThe well-known author and ex-CIA employee Philipp Giraldi assumes that the viruses must come from a laboratory.\n“Several reports indicate that there are components of the virus that are HIV-related and could not have occurred naturally. If it is true that the virus was either developed or even made into a weapon, it would further suggest that its escape from the Wuhan Institute of Virology's laboratory into the animal and human population could have been accidental. Technicians who work in such environments are aware that laboratory \"leaks\" are common, \"wrote Philip Giraldi in an article published on Thursday by the Strategic Culture Foundation.\nNews Front reported on Friday about the above publication. With all of these facts suggesting US involvement, the objection that the United States itself is affected by the corona crisis is justified, although not the worst. After all, countries like China and Iran are still the most affected countries, which are also accused by the US of spreading the pandemic.\nIf one now takes Giraldi's theses into account, which state that the corona virus did not arise naturally and is used worldwide as a biological weapon, it is no wonder that no security measure has so far been unsuccessful. Because it is quite possible that the viruses were deliberately placed where they are most spreading. In Germany that would be the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where 358 cases of coronavirus infections have been confirmed since the weekend."}, {"url": "https://zen.yandex.ru/media/id/5c62e2c6ae6f0200adeabbc4/chi-ushi-torchat-izza-koronavirusa-versiia-5e8b0cfa43499365394eb203", "title": "Whose ears stick out due to coronavirus? Version", "text": "Whose ears stick out due to coronavirus? Version\nSymbol of the day. A traditional British double-decker bus has put on a mask for infection.\nPhoto from news2world.net\nToday in world public opinion there are two addresses where they try to find the culprit of launching the coronavirus on the Planet - these are the USA and China.\nThe European “Brians who are the head” manage to ascribe Russia to this list of “guilty” for allegedly its “propaganda”. “The main goal of the Kremlin misinformation is to aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries .. in line with the Kremlin’s broader strategy of attempting to undermine European societies,” the Voice of America quoted a document prepared by the European External Relations Service. Well, it will become with them - for these people with bright faces, Russia is always to blame for everything. They do not want to look at themselves in the mirror - apparently, there the reflection is very vile. Are scared ...\nAnd things in the world are very sad. For example, it is reported that almost 4 billion people are already quarantined in dozens of countries, and the losses of the economy are also specific countries, and, as Vasily Ivanovich said, “on a global scale”, are terrible. So, to the Euro-lucky people, than to blame and blame Russia, we should look into our own news.\nBut, sooner or later, when all this tararam will be overcome - and it will be overcome - the agenda of the UN, the Hague, the New Nuremberg, will bring up the question: \"What kind of bastard did this nasty thing to the people of the Earth?\"\nAccording to indirect indications, this topic is already being discussed at the level of the leadership of Russia and the United States - it’s enough to see the following phrases in a telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump: “There was a lengthy telephone conversation ... The heads of state expressed serious concern about the scale of the spread of coronavirus in the world and informed each other on measures taken in Russia and the United States to counter this threat. The possibilities of closer cooperation between the two countries in this direction were discussed. ”\nCan we assume that the presidents did not discuss the medical, but the political aspects of the case with the coronavirus? Can we assume that the phrase “closer cooperation to counter this threat” means, in particular, joining forces to find out where this threat came from? And if this is so, then the relevant services will be instructed to work in this regard together and coordinated. As a result, we believe that success on such a scale of cooperation between special services will be achieved, and pandemic fossils will become known.\nBy the way, immediately after a conversation with Putin, the US president notified the US Congress of his intention to dismiss the inspector general of intelligence services of the country, Michael Atkinson. “It is imperative that I fully trust the people who are appointed to the post of inspector general. This does not apply to this inspector, ”Trump emphasized. Atkinson trump has long been suspected of working against himself in the process of preparing the impeachment by the Democrats, which failed. But only today - why, say, not a month ago, he made this decision? Why would it be to change the coordinator of special services in the midst of a coronavirus?\n“Is fecit cui prodest” - “The one who benefited did it”\nFor our part, we will bring to the attention of dear readers some more facts, in addition to the dismissal of Atkinson, which, depending on their interpretation, can be interpreted as options for determining the true authors and customers of this terrorist act. Most likely, there is no way to find the performers anymore - the cleaners have already worked ... And now, for example, Francis Anthony Boyle, one of the largest experts in the field of biological weapons in the world, points to the possibility of such an interpretation of what has happened. He acknowledged that coronavirus (COVID-19) was being developed as a biological weapon.\nIn order to continue the conversation and look for the extreme, we first pay attention to the possibilities and intentions of several \"suspects\" in launching \"nasty things to the people.\"\nChina? Why do the Chinese need such an “initiative”? It puts in jeopardy and simply brings down the PRC Strategy for promoting its trade and economic project on the Planet. And this is not only “One Belt - One Way”, but, more importantly, the initiative of Xi Jinping on the “Community of One Fate” for all of Mankind. That is, if, say, the Chinese are \"caught by the hand\", then their entire long-term Strategy flies into the abyss. These things are not at risk. Therefore, we reject suspicions that coronavirus is a Chinese initiative.\nUSA. There are many suspicions that it was the American opponents of Trump who decided to cheat on the president on the eve of the 2020 elections in order to push him out of the White House. Private Trump Enemies Initiative? Perhaps ... There really is a fight unleashed in full, at least because the loser will simply be defeated - but, \"no one wanted to die.\"\nLet us also not forget that for any American the most important thing is money. And this factor of the typically American “make money” does not fit into the scheme of the American origin of the worldwide provocation with coronavirus. In any case, at the state level.\nThe Yankees squeezed out a lot of concessions from China as part of the Trump trade war. He had already extinguished the Chinese and began to count profits instead of losses. So, the American state in the person of the political leadership was clearly not interested in starting this orgy. Although ... the Chinese themselves have already accused the American delegation of the fact that it \"inherited\" it during the recent World War Games in this same Wuhan and brought the coronavirus to them.\nIt’s not like the Yankees were preparing to get good money from pushing China - hundreds of billions of dollars, but they received an army and a national guard on the streets of New York to control the city where the coronavirus was raging. Too big price. So, it does not seem that the Americans provoked an epidemic. They are crying now - a country on the verge of declaring a state of emergency. The military is already declaring that they can take power.\nBut quietly sitting are those who, with great pleasure, would avenge both the Chinese and Americans for all the insults inflicted over the past decades. These are the British. Can we say that, with a high probability, sooner or later they will fall into suspicion of initiating a global collapse? Let's get into the details.\nIn a quiet pool, it is known who lives\nThen there will be only facts. In itself, each fact is not a proof, but all of them brought together reveal a completely unusual picture of what is happening and suggest certain thoughts, as well as lead to certain conclusions.\nSo - the invoice.\nFor almost 400 years, the British Empire ruled the Earth. Let's look at the holy calendar and read: “The foundation of the British Empire took place at the beginning of the 17th century with the advent of small English settlements in North America and the West Indies and the organization of a number of private companies for trade with Asia, including the East India Company in 1600 \".\nThe phrase \"The sun never sets over the British Empire\" is a geographical fact. At the same time, this fact became geopolitical. And until the end of World War II, it remained a centuries-old reality. We emphasize - centuries-old. And this enters the flesh and blood ...\nDuring negotiations and meetings during the war between US President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, it was agreed that, after the Victory over the enemy, the British would open up their colonies' markets for US goods. For the war - while Europe was fighting on its territory - the Yankees quickly promoted production, and competitors in the Old World destroyed themselves.\nChurchill’s surrender to the United States marked the beginning of the end of the British colonial Empire. And the first to receive independence was the colony, which was considered the \"largest diamond in the British crown\" - India. The loss to the Britons was momentous.\nThen, in 1956, the United States, together with the USSR (!), Directly opposed Great Britain in the Suez crisis, and the British had to begin their withdrawal from the Middle East. They closed their last colonies here in the 1970s. And in the early 60s almost all the colonial conquests in Africa were lost. “Year of Africa. 1960 ”was the year of the collapse of the African wing of the Empire for London.\nThen, again, under pressure from the Americans in 1973, Great Britain was almost forcibly pushed into the European Union (then it existed as the European Economic Community), and two years later even held a referendum, figuring out whether the inhabitants of the country needed this entry? Most then agreed that, they say, \"necessary.\" But the question of withdrawing from the EU was not resolved and was postponed. Until 2016 The EU framework has always hindered the pursuit of an independent Empire policy.\nAnd now she felt her chance for rebirth.\nBrexit as a hunch\nThe British seemed to know that it was time to leave the European Union. The 2016 referendum, which paved the way for Brexit, that is, Britain’s exit from the EU, was preceded, you remember, by a four-day state visit to the chairmen of the PRC, Comrade Xi Jinping, in London. And after that visit, the British decided to leave the EU, because they agreed with the Chinese that they “jumped” from the board of the sinking, as they already saw, EU boats to the coast of China in the face of the rising East. Moreover, since the “Opium Wars” organized by the British Empire in the Middle Kingdom in the 19th century, the British have established channels of communication with certain groups of Chinese elites. And these channels have not rusted since two centuries. And such secret communications were maintained during the days of communist China - from English Hong Kong. The British always keep their agents in the East carefully and for decades, if not centuries. This is a school.\nAlways considered the British to be good strategists. He doubted only once in that quality when he assessed the losses of Great Britain from leaving the EU, but as it turns out today, they calculated and ran away exactly a month before the start of the coronavirus pandemic in Europe. The decision was finally made on January 31, 2020, although the British have been pulling with the release since March 2019 for almost nine months - like a \"prenatal term.\" And with this verified step, as it is clear today, they have demonstrated their abilities to build an effective policy. They now - beyond the pressure and limitations of the EU - have their hands free for any independent actions. Moreover, in a crisis. Especially when everything around the world is changing rapidly.\nMoreover, the British in the conditions of coronavirus can say to the EU: “We now owe you nothing,” although their exit ticket is valued at hundreds of billions of euros. By some estimates, even one trillion. But ... the epidemic \"washes away all debts\": \"I forgive everyone I owe ...\" This is called - \"leave in English.\"\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson once announced that he was stopping drinking until the Brexit saga ended. Now his vow is in the past.\nAn important point. In the course of the long history with Brexit, the British received, as they say, an “indecent proposal” from the Americans in the form of a draft US trade and economic agreement - Great Britain, which they considered an “American noose” or an “American collar” around the neck of London. The Trump guys made this paper so that, if signed, de facto the entire UK economy would come under the control of the Yankees. And the Yankees would like to get this control in conditions when, as they believed, \"the British have nowhere to go\" after the break with the EU.\nIn addition, Britain began to lose the benefits of its City of London as a base of global financiers. In continental Europe, Brexit gave rise to the hope that money from the City would be transferred, for example, to Frankfurt, where a new platform was already prepared for them in the form of an alternative financial center. But ... Germanic. But you need to know the relationship of the Anglo-Saxons with the Germans - this is the relationship of a cat and a dog in order to understand the reaction of London bankers who could swim away - and they have already started moving along the road to Frankfurt, hundreds of billions.\nThe British, rushed to the Chinese, reminding those about how Her Majesty rolled in 2015, C's London comrade in a royal carriage. They even would like to regain their influence in the former colony - in Hong Kong, where they have very decent positions in the banking sector to transfer assets saved from the Germans there. But, cunning Chinese staged a pseudo-Maidan in Hong Kong, and still did not extinguish it, deliberately dragging out time. The months were gone, and the British, as a result, were left without the Chinese “alternate airfield” ...\nThe British Isles were angry about it. Anti-Chinese propaganda flourished. And, when British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab had just announced on Twitter that the country “received 300 ventilation devices from China and thousands more are on the road, like masks and other protective equipment,” the comments tweeted mainly curses and insults against the Chinese from stiff English, warmed up by anti-Chinese propaganda:\n\"- It's time to boycott China until they want to join humanity and act together with humanity and democracy.\"\n\"- Made in China. Just like a virus and everything else. ”\n\"- Return the fans to them, and let them receive a full refund.\"\n“- Thanks to them for lying about the virus for 2 months?” Thanks to them for hiding the virus? Thanks to them for silencing the doctors who wanted to tell the world? Thanks to them for letting people travel at this time to places like London, infecting millions? ”\n\"- We must completely boycott China, like any other country on Earth.\"\n“- I can’t believe that in the current situation, someone can trust China. I would rather trust the rattlesnake to cure my arthritis. ”\nIn general, the society is “charged” - “guilty” is named and marked. Very similar to the cry \"Hold the thief!\"\nThe Skripals story gets a new dimension\nMeanwhile, money from Hong Kong, possibly English holdings, rushed to ... Ireland, where the Anglo-Saxons can not stand for the fact that at one time the Britons turned the Irish into white slaves, which in the slave markets were cheaper than blacks from Africa. Therefore, in Ireland, English deposits will not be comme il faut at all.\nApparently, calculating such alignments, the former owners of the \"Empire, the sun never sets on them\", demonstrated their capabilities in the notorious \"Skripals case\" as a transparent hint to some. No, not Russia - they dragged us together, like a cover operation.\nAnd now this “business” has begun to play with new colors. In a nutshell - the Britons “lit up” their Porton Down laboratory for the production of chemical warfare agents near Salisbury and hinted to everyone that they were doing things related to biological warfare. Moreover, if you trust the fragmentary information that the Skripals are still alive and hidden somewhere - that no \"newbie\" took them, then experts can conclude that the British have an \"antidote\" against poison.\nThe recent coronavirus infection of Prince Charles, his successful recovery and return to a family that temporarily publicly distanced itself from its future king is evidence of this “antidote”. A quick recovery from the coronavirus of Prime Minister Boris Johnson will testify to the same.\nCoronavirus in the Palace. Prince Charles on the balcony of Buckingham Palace - on the left. The whole royal family is on the right.\nPhoto shutterstock.com\nA new factor in the reformatting of the UK medical industry “under the coronavirus” was the swift decision of the British Minister of Health and former General Treasurer of the country, Matt Hancock, to cancel the debt of the National Health Service (NHS) to the state in the amount of 13.5 billion pounds. Now this unlocking of funds opens up wide financial opportunities for the NHS in terms of the fight against coronavirus. But, after all, for years over this service hung the stigma of a \"debtor.\"\nBut, as soon as needed, everything about it was instantly forgotten. And now we will see how the hypothetical \"antidote\" will work on Foggy Albion when connecting the NHS wide capabilities. Moreover, at the beginning of the epidemic, the statement of the British authorities that they de \"strive for the onset of collective immunity\" was rather strange.\nApparently, inspired by the news, subjects of Her Majesty on Sunday April 5 went in orderly rows to beaches and picnics. This weekend in the country the weather was clear and the air temperature rose to 21 degrees. So they went to sunbathe under the ad \"Keep social distance.\" No fear:\nPhotos from Twitter\nWhile everyone was relaxing in the fresh air, an interesting acknowledgment was made by the British bio-veteran veteran Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, the former commander of the Chemical, Biological, Radiation and Nuclear Defense Regiment. His conversation with The Telegraph newspaper was presented as follows: “A Russian military mission, which is supposedly in Italy to help combat the coronavirus crisis, will secretly gather vital intelligence, warned a British expert on chemical and biological warfare ... It’s incredible that the Russians were allowed to enter NATO country on extremely redundant grounds. ”\nAnd so - not just “excessive”, but “extremely excessive”. Perhaps the Britons were afraid that the Russians would find some evidence in Italy?\nQueen Elizabeth II: “Better days will come back”\nOn the evening of April 5, Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain Elizabeth II addressed the nation. As indicated in London - this is an exceptional event - only four times the monarch turned to his subjects for almost 70 years of rule in addition to regular greetings on Christmas and New Year:\n- in 1991 in connection with the Gulf War;\n- in 1997 - after the death of Princess Diana;\n- in 2002 - after the death of the Queen Mother;\n- In 2012, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of his wedding with the principle of Philip.\nShe said, in particular, as the BBC reports:\n“Although we had to overcome difficulties before, this time there is one difference. This time we joined forces with all countries on the planet, using the great achievements of science and our natural empathy for healing. We will succeed - and this success will belong to each of us ... And those who come after us will say that this generation of Britons was no less powerful than all the others. We must take comfort in the fact that although we still have to endure many difficulties, better days will return ... ”\n\"The best days will return ... This generation of Britons is no less powerful than all the others.\" Very significant.\nCan we assume that Great Britain - the former \"mistress of the seas\" and the global colonial Empire - in the current bedlam and scenario, the advent of which could have been calculated in advance (her accurately withdrawal from the EU before the days is an indirect evidence of this), was completely inspired by the idea of \"returning her \"When there are so many ambiguities about the Future.\nAbandon the dominance that the Anglo-Saxons have possessed for centuries? No, this is not in the genes of the descendants of privateers Drake and Morgan. But now is a very good time to return the authority and world influence of London. World communications are torn, and will still take on new, different forms and outlines. Chance for the British crown.\nAll this raises the question of whether or not we are witnessing the revenge of the Anglo-Saxons live? The United Kingdom will also be avenged for a Chinese fortale in Hong Kong and for the \"indecent offer\" the Yankees intended to put on a collar for proud Britons; and for “all the good” that remained in the memory of the British from being in the EU with the pressure of the Brussels bureaucracy that has grown in recent years. Can you imagine Her Majesty obeying the instructions of Brussels officials, and even “base blood”?\nA hint of what is happening is contained in the just-published commentary by geopolitics guru Henry Kissinger for the Wall Street Journal, The Coronavirus Pandemic Will Forever Alter the World Order - The Coronavirus pandemic will forever change the world order. He writes, in particular: \"The main test is whether it is possible to stop and reverse the spread of the virus in a way that would maintain the confidence of the people in the ability of Americans to control themselves.\"\nYou hear: \"... the ability of Americans to control themselves\" ?! And what, someone - from the outside - claims the role of \"US external control\"? Did old Henry see someone else's plan to regain influence and control in the American colonies? And who else wants this besides the former colonialists? Here it is - a long-term goal!\nYes, barrage winds on top of world power have rocked the whole world. And, in conditions of general confusion, London strategists may be able to build such a political line that without them, neither West nor East will pass into the Future.\nThe Crown Empire shows its intentions - it does not want to stay on the sidelines, or in the American wagon train, as a result of the global changes that have begun.\nAnd now the virus is called \"Corona\". Why's that?\nThe opinion of the author may not coincide with the opinion of the publisher.\nRead other International Life magazine materials on our website."}, {"url": "https://es.news-front.info/2020/04/11/por-primera-vez-en-75-anos-los-europeos-ni-siquiera-pueden-comprar-alimentos-pero-en-la-ue-prefieren-permanecer-en-silencio/", "title": "For the first time in 75 years, Europeans cannot even buy food, but in the EU they prefer to remain silent", "text": "This was said by BBC broadcaster Simon Jenkins, commenting on the situation with the so-called € 500 billion European \"Marshall Plan\" for The Guardian.\nAs you know, not on the first attempt, but a strategy to overcome the crisis was approved. However, as Jenkins pointed out, the EU has not agreed to divide the economic burden of the pandemic into European treasures as a whole.\n\"The reason is obvious and as old as the EU itself. The countries of northern Europe in the eurozone still do not believe that the southern countries in difficult situations spend money wisely and pay their debts. It was the same restraint that slowed down the response to the 2008 financial crisis. In other words, the EU is not a true political union like the United States, Russia or even the United Kingdom, ”says the journalist.\nHe drew attention to the fact that the European Union \"moves away and hopes that the problems will disappear\", if one of the countries arises. He cited the migration crisis as an example, which particularly hit Greece and Italy.\n\"This week it has become very clear that many European governments simply do not trust Italians and Spaniards,\" he continues. - “Italy, of course, is experiencing an economic crisis. Their system of delivering cash to the poor has failed. ”\nThis led to the fact that, for the first time in three quarters of a century, \"large numbers of Europeans simply cannot buy food,\" but Brussels bureaucrats armed themselves again with the policy of ignoring problems.\nAs News Front reported, formerly the head of European diplomacy Josep Borrel expressed the main problem of the strategy to restore the EU economy after the pandemic. He called it the second “Marshall plan,” without considering that this time Europe does not have the same Marshall, Borrell said. Therefore, this time the Europeans have to restore everything on their own. At the same time, the head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, argues that Europe now needs to step up the fight against Euroscepticism and convince people that the EU has not lost its relevance.\nSource"}, {"url": "https://www.al-binaa.com/archives/233368", "title": "Corona pandemic: the dangers of developing biological weapons * - Al-Benaa newspaper", "text": "Corona pandemic: the dangers of developing biological weapons *\nThe rapid spread and diversification of infectious epidemics worldwide since the beginning of the third millennium imposes a series of questions about the fact of its scientific roots, in the first place, and the political and strategic dimensions of all mankind from the directions of countries producing biological weapons arsenals, especially the United States.\nOn these days in January 2012, an international conference convened by the United Nations in Geneva to develop mechanisms for monitoring biological weapons failed, in which the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, delivered a speech “encouraging the ongoing efforts to protect humanity from the specter of biological weapons”; Strongly rejected the establishment of international restrictions to verify the safety of the world.\nJohn Bolton preceded him in his official position as Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, 2001, by rejecting the investigation system that the United Nations reached after painstaking years of negotiations, in whole and in detail, saying: “The United States will simply not enter into agreements that would allow Rogue states or others develop and deploy biological weapons.\nThree countries are \"internationally trusted\" in the implementation of the Biological Weapons Convention concluded in 1975 with the signing of 165 countries: Russia, Britain and the United States to receive complaints and suggest solutions.\nAmong the scientific complaints received by the “Big Three,” December 9, 2001, was a briefing by the American human rights organization Ithaca to the Seventh International Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention: its content was that the United States violated the treaty because of its active involvement in developing an offensive biological weapons program Store it in \"Sierra Army Depots,\" in northern California, and \"possibly in other areas.\"\nIt is noteworthy that the then US administration introduced “Article 817” to the articles of the Patriot Act, 2001, whereby the government would allow the development and stockpiling of biological weapons and their release systems without restrictions, that is, a practical abolition of the texts of the international agreement signed on it.\nWhat is striking and disturbing is what was \"foretold\" by the then Deputy Minister of Internal Security, Daniel Gerstein, addressing the aforementioned international conference, 2012, that his country \"expects an epidemic to spread at the end of 2013.\" \"Diagnosis\" was shared by Dr. Joseph Kim at the Enuvio Vaccine Production Company.\nThe official US prediction of a pandemic before it occurred raised a range of questions and speculation about the dangerous extent of the biological weapons program and its threat to the lives and welfare of large numbers of people.\nHollywood was accompanied by the production of a movie called Contagion (Infectious) in 2011, which revolves around a pandemic caused by bats, according to the prepared scenario, which is currently taking place with the Corona epidemic in China, which predicts that bats are the source of the virus in Wuhan Province.\nIn the context of the American \"prediction\", China was exposed in 2013 to a huge wave of \"bird flu - H7N9\", and it immediately started to exterminate millions of chicken birds and the negative repercussions it left not only on its economy, but at the global level to ban trafficking and dealing with Beijing. Repeat it these days also.\nAnd the US government announced, on January 31, last year, that it had implemented \"new measures to combat the Corona virus, including preventing Chinese citizens from entering its territory; and applying quarantine to individuals coming from there.\"\n“In 1971, Cuba was the first country in the Caribbean to announce its exposure to a dengue epidemic. It is believed that its source came from Spain.” That was the summary of a 2009 medical publication from the prestigious US Institutes of Health. Cuba, in turn, accused the US government of spreading the epidemic that infected its livestock from pigs and of having to exterminate half a million heads.\nScientifically, the Corona virus infects the human respiratory system, similar to its predecessor, the SARS epidemic - acute pneumonia - and the origins of the two strains are from animals transmitted to humans, and then to its human brother; And its spread in Saudi Arabia in 2012, causing severe pneumonia to the patient.\nSome experts in the field of biological sciences suggest that the US government will engage in \"designing a biological attack against China for geopolitical considerations\", coinciding with the spread of \"a new and dangerous epidemic\" with the Chinese New Year celebrations to paralyze the Chinese society, a large majority of whom will use transportation to return to their original villages.\nProfessor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, Richard Eberat, expressed to the Washington Post his doubts about the American source, because \"the genome of the virus and its properties do not indicate that it is the kind produced\" in the laboratory.\nThe newspaper and the American media in general have accused China of developing biological weapons in the Wuhan facility for \"engaging in espionage activities to obtain biological components.\"\nAt the beginning of last week, he recorded a federal court filing an indictment against Harvard professor Charles Lieber “and two persons of Chinese nationality for their attempts to smuggle 21 tubes containing biological materials to China.” And Lieber receives a monthly reward of fifty thousand dollars from Wuhan Technical University, according to the indictment.\nWhat strengthens the hypotheses of the American source of the virus is the Trump administration’s policy to fight China by all means, starting with trade wars, and also exposing it to a series of “deadly bacterial attacks and viral diseases, and symptoms targeting both livestock and humans.”\nThe Epidemiologist at the Rand Institute, Jennifer Bowie, confirmed the close link between the two epidemics (SARS and Corona), as “the compatibility ratio between them is at least 70% of genetic material and transmission mechanisms ... The mortality rate for people with SARS is about 10%, compared to 3 % For Corona Virus ».\nBowie praised the transparency of scientists and the Chinese government and the “sharing of the international scientific edifice with the genome data of the virus,” and reached them to find the causes within a short period of time, not exceeding a few days, which will contribute to developing an effective vaccine soon.\nAmerican epidemiologist Dina Grayson expressed concern about a set of facts surrounding the Corona virus, especially the high speed of its spread from person to person.\nIt is worth noting that Corona virus is a US product with distinction, according to the registry of invention submitted in 2015, which was approved in 2018.\nIn the same context, there are strange \"separate\" incidents that targeted China originating in North America; the most prominent of which was a shipment arrival issued by Canadian biological laboratories, in March 2019, which included \"malicious viruses\", the Canadians claimed to be \"part of the research efforts to support public health research in the world.\" ». It is noteworthy that this shipment was carried out under the veil of secrecy, in contrast to the usual procedures, which prompted the Chinese side to file a formal complaint.\nA large US military delegation, consisting of 300 personnel, arrives in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China on October 19, 2019, to participate in a military games festival hosted by China held there. On November 2, 2019, the first infection with the Corona virus was recorded in that province, and it later spread rapidly in December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days.\nThe cost of what China was exposed to as a result of the epidemic is prohibitive by all measures: disruption of flights and the movement of trains and other transportation at the height of the largest and most important annual feasts; and the stricken Wuhan municipality imposed a ban on leaving the town for its residents «except for urgent reasons; and the construction of a mobile hospital within five days for people living with HIV specifically; and life is disrupted Daily and phenomenal business exchanges with the world.\nUltimately, who can answer the question of who is the beneficiary of all this can get to the heart of the matter: waging wars with biological weapons at a lower cost than nuclear engagement.\n* Center for American and Arab Studies"}, {"url": "https://www.rjeem.com/%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B3-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%A3%D8%A9/", "title": "New conspiracy theory: Bill Gates behind the genesis and spread of the Corona virus", "text": "New conspiracy theory: Bill Gates behind the origins and spread of the Coronavirus\nNew conspiracy theory: Bill Gates behind the origins and spread of the Coronavirus\nRoger Stone suggested on Monday that Bill Gates might have had a hand in creating the Corona virus and spreading the pandemic throughout the world.

For me, as a theologian, a specialist in scripture, two Latin roots are heard in this word - a virus (Latin virus - poison) and a crown. In the synodal translation of the Bible, the Latin word corona corresponds to the word crown. For example, the kings crowned the crown, the Crown of twelve stars crowned the Woman clothed in the sun (Rev. 12.1), the Roman soldiers crowned the crown of thorns with Jesus Christ.\nThe crown is a sign of power, power, independence.\nToday, humanity imagined itself to be a king, independent of God and put a crown on his head, sitting on the throne of self-confidence and self-worship. Only, as in that fairy tale, the king turned out to be naked, his crown turned out to be a poison - a virus, and instead of reigning, he himself was dying of fear of the expectation of disasters coming to the universe (cf. Lk 21,26).\nAnd this fear, panic, hysteria are the main achievement of the new virus. First of all, the horror is caused by the numbers, because in three months about 50 thousand people died from the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) requires that these figures be announced every day, as if specifically to achieve the maximum effect from this panic. Despite the fact that, according to WHO estimates, 290-650 thousand people die from common flu in a year First of all, the elderly. Of course, no one even remembers that 50 million children die every year from abortion, because pictures of coffins from Italy are worse than pictures of the remains of a child washed into the toilet after mifepristone.\nThe panic from the coronavirus that WHO is sowing is particularly delighted by the liberal media, demanding quarantine, closing borders and other tough restrictive measures around the world.\nLet WHO offer such a quarantine in the case of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV! So no, on the contrary, they hang up posters saying \"HIV is not transmitted when it is being treated.\" So after all, the coronavirus is treated and cured!\nYes, this current virus is more aggressive than usual, perhaps the mortality from it will be higher than from the flu. But this is not a reason to bring down the economy, separate people, divide countries and fine for violating quarantine, as if the Third World War was going on.\nIn such a situation, it is difficult to get rid of the feeling that the global crisis caused by the coronavirus is the main achievement of this virus. It is unfortunate that, to the shame and shame of Christians, quarantine often begins with churches, which would just show the world stamina and courage. The terrified hierarchs in many countries have significantly limited or even canceled church services instead of calling on their flock to even more vigorously bring repentance for sins to God, as was always the case during infection. Online worship even more humanizes people who already suffer from isolation and loneliness.\nTo the credit of our native Belarus, which has survived many terrible tragedies in its lifetime, we have neither secular nor church quarantine. There are only a few such countries in the world.\nThere are some limitations that are not suggested by WHO, but by common sense. Who wants to panic, go into a distance, to buy pasta and cereals - this is his right. But, thank God, no one forbids us to go to church, to work, to school, to the store and even to football. The country lives, works, studies and prays, and I am sincerely proud that I live in a country where common sense is not lost and people are not amenable to panic attacks. Indeed, the fear of waiting for disasters coming to the universe is worse than the disasters themselves.\nMore on the topic ↓\nDiscussion\nMore on the topic\nReplica:\n59\nReplica:\n14\nReplica:\n66\nReplica:\n52\nMore on the topic\nOleg Ozernov\nCreative entrepreneur engineer\nFrom Kovids Informbureau!\nField, Front, Backyard Summary\nOleg Ozernov\nCreative entrepreneur engineer\nYou won’t surprise a sailor with quarantine\nVladimir Borisovich Shilin\nDoctor of Technical Sciences\nHow a baptized atheist almost became a believer\nPeter Davydov\nJournalist\nThere is no return ...\nOperation Spider\nIlya, reading this book to a normal person, IMHO, is completely impossible.

The most affected economies will be those that have reacted late and badly to the threat, especially Western Europe and America, says the expert.\n\"Countries like Russia, China and India will recover sooner. On the other hand, the countries of Europe will suffer much more, especially due to the lack of solidarity between the countries of the north and the south,\" he said.\nBermejo anticipates that the coronavirus pandemic will cause a serious crisis in the community bloc. \"Now is when we will see if we really are a European Union or a utopia,\" he adds.

There are over 40 companies now searching for a vaccine. Collectively they are spending huge sums of money supported by lavish amounts of tax payer cash. Estimates of how soon a vaccine can be produced vary wildly but most estimates agree that it is unlikely to happen this year. It goes without saying that the first to market with a usable vaccine stands to make billions of dollars.\nThe mainstream media, scientific and political establishments are completely under the spell of big pharma. Governments reassure the public that they’re doing everything in their power to protect them with a variety of measures. These range from mass lock downs and trillion dollar bailouts for big business to limited amounts of helicopter money for the citizens of wealthier countries.\nRegardless of where you live if you have to go to hospital with symptoms of the coronavirus the key question facing you is: will you be able to leave walking out front door or will you end up being wheeled out the basement back door?\nThe mainstream media in cahoots with governments and the medical establishment are suppressing any news regarding the use of a cheap, safe and easy to produce treatment for coronavirus patients. Maybe its because this treatment is being used in Chinese hospitals to save lives. Let’s face it there has been no let up in Cold War 2.0 during the current pandemic.\nDr. Andrew W. Saul, Editor in chief of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, sums up the Western big pharma approach nicely when he says:\n“Medical orthodoxy obsessively focuses on searching for a vaccine and/or drug for coronavirus COVID-19). While they are looking for what would be fabulously profitable approaches, we have with vitamin C an existing, plausible, clinically demonstrated method to treat what coronavirus patients die from: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or pneumonia.”\nOn 17 March a group of Chinese physicians held a video conference to discuss the use of high dose intravenous vitamin C for patients with moderate to severe cases of corona virus. The keynote speaker at this meeting was Dr. Enqian Mao, chief of the emergency medicine Department of Ruiijin hospital in Shanghai.\nDr Mao is also a senior member of the expert team at the Shanghai Public health Centre, where all coronavirus patients have been treated from the Shanghai area. Dr Mao was also a co-author of the medical protocol for the treatment of coronavirus that has been adopted by the Shanghai Medical Association and the government of Shanghai. This medical protocol also advocates the use of high-dose intravenous vitamin C for the treatment of mild, moderate and severe cases of the coronavirus.\nOver the last decade Dr Mao has been using high-dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) to treat patients with a variety of acute medical conditions ranging from pancreatitis and sepsis to surgical wound healing. When the coronavirus epidemic first broke out he and several other colleagues thought that high-dose intravenous C could be a potential treatment for patients presenting with the coronavirus. Their recommendation for the use of high-dose intravenous vitamin C as a treatment was adopted by the Shanghai expert team.\nDr. Richard Cheng, an American-Chinese doctor currently based in Shanghai has given a report of this meeting. He notes that:\n“Dr. Mao stated that his group treated ~50 cases of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 infection with high dose IVC. The IVC dosing was in the range of 10,000 mg – 20,000 mg a day for 7-10 days, with 10,000 mg for moderate cases and 20,000 for more severe cases, determined by pulmonary status (mostly the oxygenation index) and coagulation status. All patients who received IVC improved and there was no mortality. Compared to the average of a 30-day hospital stay for all Covid-19 patients, those patients who received high dose IVC had a hospital stay about 3-5 days shorter than the overall patients. Dr. Mao discussed one severe case in particular who was deteriorating rapidly. He gave a bolus of 50,000 mg IVC over a period of 4 hours. The patient’s pulmonary (oxygenation index) status stabilized and improved as the critical care team watched in real time. There were no side effects reported from any of the cases treated with high dose IVC. ”\nDr Cheng also reported that he had a separate meeting with Dr. Sheng Wang, Professor of critical medicine of Shanghai’s 10th Hospital, Tongji University College of medicine. At this meeting Professor Weng said that there were several important lessons to be learned from Shanghai’s experience treating patients with the coronavirus. The most important lesson was:\n“Early and high-dose IVC is quite helpful in helping Covid-19 patients. The data is still being finalized and the formal papers will be submitted for publication as soon as they are complete.”\nProfessor Wang also stated that coronavirus patients displayed a high rate of hyper-coagulability, i.e. an abnormally increased tendency toward blood clotting, which is best treated with heparin.\nHe also stated that it was vitally important for front line medical professionals to, ‘wear protective clothing at the earliest opportunity for intubation and other emergency rescue measures.’ The American health authorities should take notice of this considering that pictures of nurses in New York wearing black plastic refuse sacks have been appearing on social media.\nRichard Chang has also noted that Professors Mao and Weng have stated that high-dose intravenous vitamin C is being used as a treatment for coronavirus patients in other hospitals around China.\nNot surprisingly, reports of this cheap, safe treatment, that has been pioneered in China, have been being completely ignored by Western governments and the medical establishments that are beholden to the big pharma approach to the current pandemic.\nThankfully, there are doctors in the West who are not blinded by the close minded approach pursued by their governments and so called medical experts. Apparently, doctors at several hospitals in New York, which is the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic in America, have started to use the pioneering treatments coming out of China.\nDr. Andrew G. Weber, a pulmonologist and critical-care specialist affiliated with two Northwell Health facilities on Long Island, has said that coronavirus patients admitted to intensive care immediately receive 1,500 mg of intravenous vitamin C. This dosage is then repeated 3-4 times a day.\nAccording to Dr. Weber this treatment regime is based upon the experimental use of high-dose vitamin C in Shanghai’s hospitals. He told the New York Post:\n“The patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C. It helps a tremendous amount, but it is not highlighted because it’s not a sexy drug.”\nApparently, high-dose intravenous vitamin C is been used in hospitals across New York. Sadly, its use appears to be patchy and is dependent upon the whims of individual doctors rather than being part of any systematic medical protocol.\nAs the global death toll soars higher we can only hope that more and more doctors will follow in the footsteps of their Chinese colleagues and have the courage to use a safe and cheap treatment that is totally at odds with the big pharma approach currently followed by the World Health Organisation and most governments. The current approach used by many Western Governments has been slow, clumsy and ill informed putting the interests of big business above saving the lives of ordinary people.\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n- Italians Were “Dumbstruck” By Russian Specialists’ Speed\nDonate"}, {"url": "https://www.emeknes.com/", "title": "In News", "text": "Saudi News\nSaudi News\nThe Shura Transport Committee discusses the annual report of the Ministry of Communications with the participation of its delegates\nSaudi Arabia: Young man arrested for drinking alcohol (video)\nSaudi News\nChinese parliament holds its annual session next May\nSaudi News\n\"Insurances\": The \"Sand Initiative\" allows the employer to freely choose the supported employees\nSaudi News\nInternational news\nIndia: Strong correlation between high temperatures and lower Corona casualties in a number of states\nBelgium records 525 new cases of corona, the lowest rate since last March\nInternational news\nAboul Gheit expresses his disquiet about the escalation situation in Libya Aboul Gheit expresses his disquiet about the escalation situation in Libya\nBoris Johnson and fiancée announce the birth of their child\nInternational news\nArab News\nMorocco records 37 new cases of coronavirus\nKuwaiti Minister of Health: 213 cases of corona were cured, with a total of 1389 cases\nIraq excludes the imposition of a \"comprehensive ban\" after an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus\nEconomy inspectors toured in Jezzine and made records of seizures\nEconomy and business\nLearn about the most common home business habits?\nThe Saudi Stock Exchange closed 1.46% higher at 6985.33 points\nEconomy and business\nBank Al-Awda translation: the balance of trade deficit decreased by 30% in January ... amid imports falling by 18%\nEconomy and business\n\"Dolmen\" directed liquidity to the construction of its projects in the administrative capital\nNeeds of interest to you ..

The separation of the United States from the distressed Old World spurred the theme of the NATO crisis. The situation in the Western world of the era of the coronavirus resembles the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which launched the mechanisms of the collapse of the USSR. In both cases, the trigger for disintegration was not an emergency itself, but a moral disaster: in the Soviet case, it was a lie, in the European and American cases it was a betrayal.\nThe mass anti-Soviet movement began in 1986 in the national republics as a movement in defense of nature. It was an obvious product of the Chernobyl disaster, which highlighted environmental safety issues.\nNo matter how good the task of striving for ecology is, it is important that the anti-Soviet principle in it immediately set a vector. It is just that factories and factories that pollute native forests and fields quickly became factories and factories of the \"occupiers\".\nBy the end of the 1980s, environmental protection turned into a struggle for secession from the USSR. First in the Baltic states, and then in other union republics.\nAs a result, after 5 and a half years after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the Soviet Union ceased to exist.\nThe Chernobyl disaster was the first impetus for centrifugal processes. Before that, the conditions for the impending collapse were only ripening in the USSR. The systemic problems of a planned economy, the weak and illiterate head of state, the decrepit surrounding him, the nomenclature that lost touch with reality - all this already happened. But a powerful trigger was needed to turn on the mechanisms of the collapse of the country.\nSuch a trigger was the shock from Chernobyl, and not so much from the accident itself, but from the behavior of the authorities, which lied to the population about what had happened.\nThe information on the scale of the nuclear reactor disaster was concealed and hushed up, then the consequences of radiation emission were denied and downplayed.\nThe evacuation of the population from the 30-kilometer zone of defeat “for the sake of peace of the international community” did not begin a week. They were silent about radiation protection measures for a week, because they tried to talk less about the very fact of the emission of radiation.\nMass events in the regions of Ukraine and Belarus adjacent to Chernobyl were not canceled, \"so as not to provoke a panic.\" The order to conduct, despite all the May Day demonstrations in Kiev, was personally given by Mikhail Gorbachev.\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union was launched not by the largest man-made disaster in history, but by a moral catastrophe of the Soviet government, which undermined its legitimacy.\nAnd exactly the same catastrophe today occurs in the West with the coronavirus, only the cause of the moral shock of the Europeans is not a lie, but a betrayal of each other by the EU and NATO.\nThese two stories have much in common. A new, hitherto unknown to the population and, therefore, especially terrible danger. The volume of problems accumulated by the time of the emergency.\nIn the case of United Europe, this is a slowdown in the economy to the threshold of a recession, the influx of refugees and the first solidarity crisis caused by an attempt to evenly distribute them throughout the European Union; alienation of the population from the establishment, withdrawal from the EU of Great Britain with its membership fees to the European budget, inability to agree on a financial perspective for the next seven years. In the case of NATO, the growing contradictions between the allies on both sides of the Atlantic.\nJust like the Gorbachev Politburo with Chernobyl, Western leaders were unable to take adequate swift action in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in Italy, which made the scale of the consequences catastrophic.\nEU institutions, for example, were simply paralyzed. These institutions, by the way, remind many of the CPSU in recent years of the Soviet system. The ideology of liberal globalism, which has long turned into a set of empty dogmas, in which, instead of beliefs, there are mantras recited for the occupation of the leadership chair in Brussels.\nIn extreme, Baltic cases, people who started an official career by reciting the mantras of Marxism-Leninism and scientific atheism end up with the same nature mantras of political correctness, tolerance and the fight against climate change.\nWestern leaders are the last-generation communist nomenclature of the USSR in its advanced years.\nAngela Merkel with her desire to preserve the system in response to any modern challenges, for example, this is our “dear Leonid Ilyich”.\nEven the analogy with the age of the ruling elite works. The “carriage race” today takes place in the US presidential election, where the main presidential candidates are much older than the Brezhnev nomenclature. From the inconsistency of the ruling class to its time - a catastrophically low speed of response to real, not fictitious, threats.\nHowever, the biggest disaster in another.\nThe refusal of the EU and NATO countries to help each other in a crisis, closing borders, ignoring requests for help and even banning the supply of essential goods is a mortal blow to these associations.\nWhen Italy begs European countries, in which there are not many cases of coronavirus infection, to save its health system from collapse and share medical personnel, who in turn forbid the Italians to export medical masks, this is a betrayal that is not forgotten and not forgiven.\nAfter this, Eurosceptics will win the election in Italy, who will raise the question of the country's withdrawal from the EU, in any case, they will no longer transfer a euro cent to the Brussels budget.\nWhen the US president, instead of a new “Marshall Plan” for the distressing Old World, lures German doctors to obtain exclusive rights to the coronavirus vaccine and sell it to Europeans at an exorbitant price, this is a nail in the lid of NATO’s coffin.\nAfter this, American troops in Europe will be perceived by Europeans not as allies and defenders, but solely as occupiers.\nThe growing crisis in the Western world has been going on for many years.\nHowever, the shocking collective West of the moral catastrophe due to the coronavirus starts the process of its actual breakdown.\nThis does not mean that NATO and the EU will take it and fall apart right tomorrow. After the Chernobyl moral disaster, the Soviet Union lasted for several more years.

Wei The context of the American “prediction” China was exposed in 2013 to a massive wave of “bird flu - H7N9, and immediately began to exterminate millions of chicken birds and what I left it from Tada It is negative not only for its economy, but also at the global level to ban trafficking and dealing with Beijing, which we are witnessing recurrence these days as well. Some experts in biological sciences suggest that the US government will engage in (designing a biological attack against China for geopolitical considerations) in conjunction with the spread of (new and dangerous epidemic) With Chinese New Year celebrations to paralyze Chinese society, a large majority of whom will use transportation to return to their original villages.\nDoubts about the source\nRichard Iberat, professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, expressed his doubts to the Washington Post because (the genome of the virus and its properties do not indicate that it is the type of product) in a laboratory. For engaging in espionage work to obtain biological components). A federal court recently indicted Harvard professor Charles Lieber and two people of Chinese nationality for trying to smuggle 21 tubes containing biological materials to China, and Lieber receives a monthly reward of $ 50,000 from Wuhan Technical University. What strengthens the hypotheses of the American source of the virus is the policy of President Donad Trump's administration, which includes fighting China by all means, starting with trade wars, as well as its exposure to series (deadly bacterial attacks and viral diseases, and symptoms targeting both livestock and people).\nAmerican product\nIt is worth noting that Corona virus is an American product par excellence, according to the record of the invention submitted in 2015 and which it received approval in 2018 in the same context, there are separate strange incidents that targeted China sourced from North America, most notably a shipment arrival incident issued by Canadian biological laboratories, in the month of March 2019, containing malicious viruses , Canadians claim to be \"part of the research effort to support public health research in the world. It is worth noting that this shipment was carried out under the veil of secrecy, in contrast to the usual procedures, which prompted the Chinese side to file a formal complaint. On October 19, 2019, a large American military delegation, consisting of 300 people, arrived in Wuhan in Hubei Province, China, to participate in a military games festival to be hosted by China held there.\nFirst recorded injury\nOn November 2, 2019, the first infection with the Corona virus was recorded in that province, and it subsequently spread quickly in December. In sum, who can answer the question of who is the beneficiary of all this can reach the heart of the matter if waging wars with biological weapons are less costly than nuclear engagement."}, {"url": "https://www.albidda.net/world/3539871.html", "title": "The page is not available", "text": "Sorry, the page you are trying to reach is not available.

This in turn was to intimidate European nations with the ineffectiveness of the European Union's activities and \"fueling panic.\" And since such a serious thesis has already happened, the facts must agree.\nSuffice it to say that in the initial phase, the help came to Italy ... Chinese and Cubans, by no means Europe.\nTusk, however, did not run short even when ... he was in quarantine himself. Straight from such a room, he repeated his thesis on Russian-Chinese information policy to be \"harmful\" live on one television.\nI am so sorry, but isn't that a bit too much, \"King of Europe?\" What is the purpose of communicating in this way, if not \"panic\"? Of course, it can be argued that it has an educational value, and the former President of the European Council is to serve as a model for Poles quarantined, but at least he could refrain from self-compromising in such a situation?\nCatching your own tail\nIn addition to the ethical dimension, which could be written for a long time, there is a theme for dramatic art in all this. If the world is one big theater, Polish journalism wrote a role for Russians on the border between detective story and fantasy, and now she is trying to play it herself.\nIf Vladimir Putin is to bring a new war to the West in the name of imperialist goals, then what role do those who aggressively respond to attempts to resolve conflicts peacefully, or even to the usual medical help?\nFinally: do we really associate 'European civilization' with behaviors such as willingness to sacrifice strangers to the imaginary interests of our own societies? And yet this was and is the call for the disappearance of Ukrainians on the front or, as now, despair because of helping Italy. Isn't it that the roles assigned to the Russians are just projections of their own behavior?\nOne Italian - one sanction?\nHowever, the real rage in the Polish establishment was caused by information about Russian assistance to Italy. Witold Jurasz quickly made an analysis in which he stated that this step is ... politically dangerous, because it increases the risk of Italian disagreement with the extension of EU sanctions against Russia.\nJurasz also noticed the superiority of the military factor over the civilian one, suggesting that the Ministry of Emergency Situations was responsible for such actions in the Russian Federation. It is not true here, but taking into account the previous journalism of this gentleman and others like him - this is a clever procedure aimed at raising speculations about the Kremlin's evil intentions.\nThis kind of argument, unfortunately, is nothing new, because we read it many times during the civil war in Ukraine, but it must be noted - the imperative for the Polish war instigation camp is to harm Russia at all costs.\nAfter all, these people spasmodically reacted to the defeat of Petro Poroshenko in the Ukrainian presidential election, because here was the \"scary\" vision of peace between Russia and Ukraine. It was these people that absolved the Neo-Bandan nationalists and their fascist fellow volunteers from around the world from subsequent crimes against the civilian population because they were supposed to save \"European civilization\" from Russia.\nWhat is all this when there is a need to continue anti-Russian policy? Let the Italians die if necessary! Witold Jurasz did not use such words and perhaps did not even mean them directly, but that is the sense, sir. Maybe it's time to change priorities?\nThe views and opinions contained in the article may be inconsistent with the editorial position."}, {"url": "https://www.vaca-ps.org/vaca/%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B4%D9%8A/", "title": "Russian politician: the United States behind the outbreak of \"Corona\" virus! - VACA BLOG", "text": "The leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, accused the United States of being behind the spread of the new \"Corona\" virus across the world.\nSource: arabic.rt.com\nVarious Arab magazines\nThe leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, accused the United States of being behind the spread of the new \"Corona\" virus across the world.\nYou must be logged in to add a comment."}, {"url": "https://es.news-front.info/2020/02/03/histeria-utilizada-como-arma-puede-estados-unidos-utilizar-el-brote-de-coronavirus-para-su-ventaja-en-las-negociaciones-comerciales-con-china/", "title": "Hysteria Used As A Weapon: Can The United States Use The Coronavirus Outbreak To Its Advantage In Trade Negotiations With China?", "text": "As global markets prepared to return to firmer ground amid early signs of economic certainty with the United Kingdom, finally abandoning the European Union and the United States in a first-phase trade agreement with China, the outbreak of Coronaviruses have led them into a downward spiral, and Washington may be the one to benefit the most, experts say.\nAmid news of the coronavirus outbreak in China, Beijing's big efforts to stem the spread of the infection have done little to prevent global stock markets from plummeting this week, with the country's Hang Seng index dropping 6 % in the first days. of ongoing hysteria, which has been partially inflamed by the media.\nThe 2019-nCoV coronavirus is not the first epidemic to have shrunk markets in the past decade. The influence of the outbreak on national economies is understandable, since China, which is the most affected, is a major producer and consumer of goods, and the quarantine of entire cities has had an effect on trade with the rest of the world.\nOvervalued epidemic?\nIn their efforts to report on the development of the outbreak, the global media appears to have overreacted, especially in light of the fact that the coronavirus has so far not been shown to be as deadly as some feared it might be.\nAs Denis Rancourt, a researcher with the Ontario Civil Liberties Association and a social theorist, explains, all of the historic flu pandemics that have received widespread public attention resulted in \"one million deaths or more.\" So far, the coronavirus has only caused a few hundred deaths, far less than the common cold in large western cities.\nThe virus quickly received the attention of the country's medical services, resulting in great efforts to prevent it from spreading to more parts of China. However, even the virus death rate of 1.5%, which is highly dependent on the total number of infected people, pales compared to mortality from the previous coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East in 2012, which reached a rate 39% mortality. Like previous virus outbreaks in China, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and \"avian flu\" in 2013, the coronavirus has received significant media coverage.\nWho benefits and suffers most from the coronavirus hype?\nExtensive attention to the coronavirus outbreak has begun to affect China economically. Several American companies, including Google, Starbucks, and Apple, recently announced that they would close their offices, factories, and stores in China to prevent the spread of the virus. Many countries, such as the USA. The US, Australia, and Russia have severely limited transportation links to the Asian nation amid fear that Chinese residents and tourists may bring the coronavirus with them.\nThis measure, in addition to the blockade of some Chinese cities, has jeopardized the country's position in global supply chains. Kevin Dowd, professor of finance and economics at Durham University School of Business in the UK, believes that some countries could take advantage of the epidemic to their advantage by putting pressure on China.\nDowd says that certain restrictions have already been imposed on the freedom of movement of Chinese citizens and that it is only a matter of time before similar limitations are implemented against the country's products.\n\"If you were an unscrupulous protectionist looking for excuses to impose more trade barriers on China, then the coronavirus is in compliance with the law. One would like to think that policymakers would not fall that low, but when it comes to trade, past experience suggests that anything goes, \"he said.\nIn addition to negatively affecting China's economic situation, the coronavirus outbreak also emerged at a very sensitive time for the country, just after the signing of the phase one trade agreement with the United States and just before the start of negotiations on the second phase.\nFew details are known about what the second phase will entail, but since the start of the outbreak, United States Treasury Chief Steve Mnuchin has already stated that signing the second phase of the agreement will not necessarily imply the imminent removal of All tariffs that have been slapped on Chinese products.\nProfessor Dowd believes that it is \"entirely possible\" for Washington to try to use the coronavirus epidemic to push the provisions of the phase two trade agreement to make it more favorable to the United States.\n“It seems to me that in trade negotiations any suit to beat the other side is considered a fair game, even when it really shouldn't be. This is especially true in today's toxic environment when both sides have proven to be completely unscrupulous and levels of mutual trust have deteriorated sharply, \"added the professor.\nDenis Rancourt, in turn, says that while the United States perceives China as the greatest threat, the outbreak of the virus is unlikely to significantly affect the resulting trade agreement between the two. But the 2019-nCoV could still be used as a \"geopolitical campaign opportunity\" to isolate China, adds the researcher.\n“Indeed, [it is] armed hysteria that creates racist responses in many Western centers. Domestic anti-Chinese racism can be politically exploited in the United States to support aggressive policies against China, including protectionist policies, \"said Rancourt.\nSource US AFRICOM Chief warns that troop reduction in Africa may leave a \"vacuum\" and increase the influence of China and Russia"}, {"url": "https://www.sana.sy/?p=1094450", "title": "Russian politician: the United States behind the Corona Virus-SANA outbreak", "text": "Moscow-Sana\nThe leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, considered that the United States was behind the outbreak of the \"Coruna\" virus worldwide.\n\"Today, the new virus is an artificial crisis behind which the United States is acting, which is economically motivated and fears its inability to pursue China,\" he said, while meeting with students and professors at the Institute of World Civilizations in Moscow today, saying that the situation will calm down within a month.\nGerinovsky pointed to similar crises in the past similar to the outbreak of the \"Corona\" virus, recalling that the spread of bird flu and other viruses led to a ban on the import of British beef and the massive purchase of medicines, which led to billions of dollars for drug companies and certain people."}, {"url": "https://radiovesti.ru/brand/60948/", "title": "Radio station \"Vesti FM\" Live", "text": "Full contact\nMorning show of Vladimir Solovyov and Anna Saffron.

However, neither the place, nor the time, nor the agenda of the meeting has been agreed yet.\nHumanity is divided in the face of threats\nThe Russian leader proposed holding a summit, speaking in Jerusalem on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Holocaust. He expressed serious concern about the \"fragmentation of the world in the face of threats.\"\n“The issues of strategic stability are part of the agenda that requires urgent and extraordinary steps. More broadly, we are talking about the survival of mankind,” said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in turn.\nIn terms of content and drama, these statements resemble the initiatives of the Soviet government in the second half of the 30s. The USSR then insisted on a joint curbing of the aggressor and the creation of a collective security system for this. The West did not heed the Soviet leadership. As a result, the world slid into World War II, and only at its end did the Yalta-Potsdam system arise, within which we supposedly still live.\nIt’s supposedly that we live, since the de facto mechanisms of the Yalta-Potsdam system have not been working for a long time. After the collapse of the USSR, the United States spontaneously, explicitly revised the mechanisms for regulating international relations. Sometimes the modern system is called the post-Yalta system, since formally all international organizations provided for by the Yalta-Potsdam accords are in force, and none of them are infringed on their rights.\nIn fact, Washington himself decides which decisions of international organizations he and his allies should implement and which not. The states that oppose the American dictatorship, their leaders and international organizations face at least sanctions, in the worst case, obstinate leaders are arrested on far-fetched occasions, and overly independent states are subjected to \"humanitarian bombing\" of the United States.\nThe world fell into a systemic crisis\nWe live in a world whose global economy is based on the Washington consensus (the era of the Washington consensus is another common name for the post-Yalta era). Politically, the dominance of the economic model of the Washington Consensus is ensured by the global hegemony of the United States.\nRather, that was until recently. But the return of Crimea right under the nose of the Americans who were already preparing to master it, ousting the United States from Syria, ineffective sanctions against Russia, Washington’s inability to force China to comply with its political and economic demands, a split of elites in the US and the EU, ongoing economic conflicts between America and The European Union - all this has demonstrated that American hegemony is ending.\nAnd without the political hegemony of the United States, pursuing the economic policy of the Washington Consensus is impossible.\nThe world fell into a systemic crisis. The hardest hit (including economically) is in the US and the West as a whole, as the main beneficiaries of the crumbling Washington consensus. When and in what state the Western countries will come out of the crisis and whether they are in full force is unknown to anyone. This is superimposed on the epidemic of coronavirus, which at another time, humanity would not have not noticed, but would have survived without much upheaval, and economic losses, for all their enormity, would not be critical.\nBut in the context of the epidemic imposing on a systemic crisis, when resources are already scarce, and here they still need to be spent on overcoming the epidemic and its consequences, the basis of globalism, the mythical unity of the West, began to crumble. Western countries began to not only be quarantined from each other, but slid into a completely egoistic policy. They refuse to help their EU partners with medical supplies and financial support. The economies of the EU states are losing sectors working for unity (tourism, joint production - the supply of components from quarantine zones through closed borders is now far from guaranteed). The United States conducted a whole military operation to export from Italy half a million tests for coronavirus, which Italy itself lacks. The West is immersed in the classical Middle Ages, where everyone is for himself and everything is against everyone. And the longer the epidemic shakes him, the deeper he will plunge there.\nWill we build a new world?\nIf the old world ends, it is necessary to agree on the rules of a \"beautiful new world.\" Actually, this was suggested by Vladimir Putin.\nA new system of international relations can be established either following the results of world wars (as it was in 1914-1918 and 1939-1945), or on the basis of a general compromise that will allow avoiding a military conflict that threatens the death of all mankind.\nIt is not known whether the summit of the \"five\" UN Security Council will take place in the fall - or later. In any case, it’s worth waiting until the results of the damage caused to the West by the epidemic become clear, the results of the oil (and I would say energy, because gas too) war, and also see how deep the Western exchanges will fall during the current stage of the global systemic crisis.\nAnd after it becomes clear who exactly survived this fascinating struggle, it will be possible to decide with whom and what it is worth talking about.\nThe only positive thing here is that it seems that the overlap of the systemic crisis, the crisis of hydrocarbon prices and the coronavirus pandemic can replace us with a new world war, acting as a \"forest nurse\" and rejecting non-viable political entities.\nThe opinion of the author may not coincide with the position of the publisher."}, {"url": "https://www.saadaonline.net/breaking-news/2697191/%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%88%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A1%D8%9F", "title": "Have we got the Corona virus from space?", "text": "We show you our visitors the most important and latest news in the following article:\nHave we got the Corona virus from space?

It contained the United States' violation of the treaty due to its involvement in an activity related to the development of an offensive biological weapons program They are stored in Sierra Army Depots, in northern California and possibly in other regions. \"\nIt is noteworthy that the then US administration introduced \"Article 817\" to the articles of the Patriot Act, 2001, and it allows the government to develop and store biological weapons and their release systems without restrictions, that is, practically canceling the texts of the international agreement signed on it.\nWhat is striking and disturbing is what was \"foretold\" by the then Deputy Minister of Homeland Security, Daniel Gerstein, addressing the aforementioned international conference, 2012, that his country \"expects a pandemic by the end of 2013\". The diagnosis was shared by Dr. Joseph Kim at the Enuvio Vaccine Production Company.\nThe official American prediction of a pandemic before it occurred raised a range of questions and speculation about the dangerous extent of the biological weapons program and its threat to the lives and welfare of large numbers of people.\nThe Hollywood community accompanied it with the production of a movie called Contagion in 2011, which revolves around a pandemic caused by bats, according to the prepared scenario, which is currently taking place with the Corona epidemic in China, which is likely to be the source of the virus in Wuhan Province.\nIn the context of the American \"prediction\", China was exposed in 2013 to a massive wave of \"bird flu - H7N9\", as it immediately began to exterminate millions of chicken birds, and this not only left negative repercussions on its economy, but at the global level to ban trade and dealing with Beijing. We are seeing it happening again these days.\nOn January 31, the US government announced its implementation of \"new measures to counter the Corona virus, including preventing Chinese citizens from entering its territory\"; and applying quarantine to individuals coming from there.\n“In 1971, Cuba was the first country in the Caribbean to announce its exposure to a dengue (dengue) epidemic, and it is believed to originate in Spain.” This was the summary of a medical bulletin issued by prestigious US health institutes in 2009. Cuba, in turn, accused the US government of spreading the epidemic Its animal wealth from pigs and it was forced to exterminate half a million heads.\nScientifically, the Corona virus infects the human respiratory system, which is similar to the previous SARS epidemic - acute pneumonia - and the origins of the two strains are from animals and have been transmitted to humans, and then to its human brother; , Due to its appearance and spread in Saudi Arabia in 2012, causing severe pneumonia to the patient.\nSome experts in the field of biological sciences suggest that the US government will engage in \"designing a biological attack against China for geopolitical considerations\", coinciding with the spread of \"the new epidemic and danger\" with the Chinese New Year celebrations to paralyze Chinese society, a large majority of whom will use transportation to return to their original villages.\nProfessor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, Richard Iberat, expressed to the Washington Post his doubts about the American source because \"the genome of the virus and its properties do not indicate that it is the kind produced in vitro\".\nThe newspaper and US circles have been charged with developing China for developing biological weapons in the Wuhan facility for a year, for \"engaging in espionage activities to obtain biological components.\"\nIt was recorded earlier this week that a federal court directed an indictment against Harvard professor Charles Lieber and \"two people of Chinese nationality for their attempts to smuggle 21 tubes inside of biological material into China\", and Lieber receives a monthly reward of $ 50,000 from Wuhan Technical University, according to the indictment .\nWhat strengthens the hypotheses of the American source of the virus is the Trump administration’s policy of fighting China by all means, starting with trade wars, and also exposing it to a series of “deadly bacterial attacks and viral diseases, and symptoms targeting both livestock and humans.”\nThe Epidemiologist at the Rand Institute, Jennifer Bowie, confirmed the close link between the two epidemics (SARS and Corona) as \"the compatibility ratio between them is at least 70% of genetic material and transmission mechanisms. The mortality rate for those with SARS is about 10%, compared to 3\" % For Corona virus \".\nBoi praised the transparency of scientists and the Chinese government, and the \"sharing of the international scientific edifice with the genome data of the virus,\" and reached them to know the causes within a short period of time, not exceeding a few days, which will contribute to developing an effective vaccine soon.\nThe American epidemiologist, Dina Grayson, expressed concern about a set of facts surrounding the Corona virus, especially from the high speed of its spread from one person to another \"It is not only contagious, but kills the infected.\" Grayson has long experience in developing drugs to treat the Ebola epidemic.\nIt is worth noting that Corona virus is a US product with distinction, according to the registry of invention submitted in 2015, which was approved in 2018.\nIn the same context, there are \"separate\" strange incidents that targeted China originating in North America; the most prominent of which was the shipment arrival of a source from Canadian biological laboratories, in March 2019, which included \"malicious viruses,\" which the Canadians claimed was \"part of the research efforts to support public health research.\" In the world.\" It is worth noting that this shipment was carried out under the veil of secrecy, in contrast to the usual procedures, which prompted the Chinese side to file a formal complaint in this regard.\nA large US military delegation, consisting of 300 people, arrives in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China on October 19, 2019, to participate in a military games festival hosted by China and held there. On November 2, 2019, the first infection with the Corona virus was recorded in that province, and it later spread rapidly in December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days.\nThe cost of what China has been exposed to as a result of the epidemic is prohibitive by all measures: disruption of flights and the movement of trains and other transportation at the height of its largest and most important annual holidays; and the stricken Wuhan municipality imposed a ban on leaving the town on the population “only for emergency reasons; Everyday life and tremendous business exchanges with the world.\nUltimately, who can answer the question about who benefits from all this can reach the heart of the matter: waging wars with biological weapons at a lower cost than nuclear engagement."}, {"url": "http://podneprovie-info.com/2020/02/18/kirill-vinogradov-oppoziciya-rasprostranyaet-koronavirus/", "title": "Kirill Vinogradov: Opposition spreads coronavirus - Dnieper Info", "text": "Kirill Vinogradov: Opposition spreads coronavirus\nIf the apocalypse of humanity begins, then it will definitely begin with the Belarusian opposition.

Information about the coronavirus is spreading rapidly on the Web and also in the near future, if the authorities do not seriously engage in opposition, “svjadomitami” and young men, then they will spread the same virus on the streets. They need millions of victims in the name of illusory freedom, of which they know nothing. Stepa NEXTA even created a rubric “But this isn’t exact” on his Telegram channel, where he distributes the following fakes: “It’s uneasy in the Goretskaya BSAA. Students say that one of the Chinese students has been sick for several days and even allegedly coughs up blood, only no one cares ”or“ Concerned parents of metropolitan schoolchildren complained to us that there is an outbreak of rotavirus infection in secondary school No. 110 and No. 119. Moreover, in secondary school №110 in some classes there are 10-15 people each, and children are not delivered to the infectious diseases hospital - supposedly there are no places. The situation is similar in secondary school No. 119 - they say that because of the outbreak of infection, a whole class was absent from the lessons. ” Do you think this is all the news from the Belarusian opposition? This is far from everything!\nCloser to the presidential election there will be more and more news on this subject, because the coronavirus has turned into an excellent “hype” - an informational political occasion. Now, with the help of coronavirus, you can scold the Russians that they have closed the borders with China and will now check at the entrance of Belarusian citizens. How many opposition publics have already gained over 10,000 subscribers with the name “coronavirus”, and then they were abruptly renamed to “Tired of this Lukashenko” or “People Against!”. Belarusian opposition play on popular feelings, they manipulate public opinion with the help of their independent resources, which it is time to cover up for a long time. And for the opposition itself, it is necessary to introduce criminal liability for the distribution of coronavirus on the Web, because if they are not stopped now, then they will really distribute it. And as mentioned earlier - if the apocalypse of humanity begins, it will begin with the Belarusian opposition.\nKirill Vinogradov"}, {"url": "https://www.aljarida.com.tn/articles/%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%8A-%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85-5-%D8%B3%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-2015-%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%82%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B1?amp", "title": "Coronary virus puzzle that slept 5 years!

The way some world centers exploit the coronavirus epidemic to control humanity is a classic example of hybrid warfare. This opinion was expressed by social science specialist David Aslanyan at a press conference at the Sputnik Armenia multimedia press center on Monday.\nIn Armenia, the coronavirus was detected on March 1 from a 29-year-old citizen of Iran, who arrived from Iran; the results of the analysis of his wife turned out to be negative. According to the Ministry of Health, the infected person has practically no symptoms of the disease and does not undergo any treatment. In Armenia, 32 people are isolated. They are placed in the Golden Palace hotel of the resort town of Tsaghkadzor.\nAt the moment, nine citizens are being tested. Results will be released during the day.\nAccording to Aslanyan, supporting and creating panic around the coronavirus epidemic, the notorious centers take the opportunity to directly influence the politics and economies of other countries. Also, such a tool helps to break the prevailing system of values, wreak havoc.\n\"It’s easy to control a person living in an atmosphere of fear and panic,\" says the social scientist.\nHe recalled the outbreak of SARS in 2002-2003 in China, which took the lives of 813 people. Then, oil prices plummeted, global stock exchanges collapsed, and China's economy suffered a loss of $ 40 billion.\nAccording to Aslanyan, no matter what the name of the new virus is - coronavirus, ebola, or something else. All this is used to control people's minds.\n“It’s difficult to control a person without panic. A person in normal conditions is busy with his creative work,” Aslanyan said.\nMeanwhile, he is sure that the fear of getting the virus is more dangerous than the virus itself.\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic in the world will cause serious damage to the global economy and lead to a global economic crisis that will be tougher than in 2008, Aslanyan is sure.\nThe analyst is sure that a person living in an atmosphere of fear loses its human appearance.

What their literature admits - beginning with Iraq and accusing it of an American of possessing weapons of mass destruction was the invasion of 2003 AD, what Syria witnessed is the strong country that Israel fears, so it was in 2011 AD and the beginning of a global war against Syria to destroy it and break up its forces, and Iran is another example that America considers guiding D, to her and her allies, sources of American exploitation, Iran's accusation of its nuclear project on the pretext of its military rather than its peacefulness, and much much, and the result is that throughout the history of the United States of America, no country or country or force of forces reached a high level of development and progress unless and tried to destroy it through its military, security and intelligence institutions And her scientific research centers, and based on this fact, my article came to make a mathematical theory in which there is imposition and demand and then proof.\nBased on the foregoing, the hypothesis of this article states that: “The rise of China economically and militarily, and its formation as an ally of the Russian Federation and heir to the Soviet Union in addition to North Korea in the first place and the countries of the resistance axis, China threatens American national security in one way or another, therefore - according to the mentality US Intelligence - From striking a blow to China that weakens its power and causes its overall level of development to decline, in order to keep the gap between China and America widening and farther away, until the ghosts of fears of the \"sleeping dragon\" die out. This hypothesis needs to be investigated in order for us to prove it or deny it.\nFirst, it is necessary to include a list of the most important rumors about Kona virus and the standing behind it, such as the following:\nFirst: The Russian media narrative focuses on one point repeatedly, which is that western political elites, especially American ones, are behind this epidemic.\nSecond: The first Russian government channel, one of the most prominent TV channels, is to allocate a fixed paragraph to address the \"Western conspiracy\" about the Corona virus, in the evening news program \"Time\".\nThird: Officially, China accuses America of being behind the Coruna virus and vowing to wipe Washington from the face of the earth, quoting Egypt's network now.\nIn tandem with the above, there is a question that presents itself: What are the data that suggested that the spread of Corona virus in China is a planned or a conspiracy?\nFirst: The Evidence: Russia's Submission that Corona is an ethnic biological weapon that states use against hostile peoples. One of the Russian experts during the report is that the Chinese Corona virus (“synthetic creature”), and that the pharmaceutical companies are behind this, historically known to be the United States The American was running a laboratory in Georgia, where she was testing biological weapons on humans.\nSecond, the logical evidence: the spread of Corona virus in China came at a time when China was preparing to literally invade the world with technology, industry and the terrible Chinese economy.\nAs a result, this evidence is insufficient and not convincing, but the Western, especially the American, is the biggest beneficiary, in countries that do not believe that what is happening from the epidemic is divine punishment, but rather mocks and employs this media and political, and I, as a researcher, build an opinion on the basis of the beneficiary, especially since its history is full With many such events, experiences and evidence, the most important of which is for human experimentation. Example: First: The Guatemala Project is just one of many gruesome experiments carried out in the name of medicine.\nSecond, US military doctors in the Philippines have infected five people with bubonic plague, and wounded 29 prisoners by land.\nThird: In the 1950s, in order to simulate a biological warfare attack, the US Navy sprayed large amounts of wilted Siratian bacteria - which were considered harmless at this time - over San Francisco during a project called Operation Sea Mist. Many citizens developed pneumonia-like illnesses, and at least one person died as a result.\nFourth: The San Francisco Chronicle, on December 17, 1979, wrote page 5 about the Church’s scientific claim that the CIA conducted a biological warfare experiment in the open air in 1955 near Tampa, Florida and other areas in Florida with pertussis bacteria. She claimed that the experience increased the number of whooping cough injuries by three times in Florida and injured more than a thousand cases, and this caused an increase in deaths due to whooping cough in the country from one to 12 over the previous year.\nFifth: In 1966, the US Army released Bacillus globuli to the New York City subway system as part of a field study called The Affliction of Subway Passengers in New York City Undercover Attack with Biological Agents. The Chicago subway system also underwent a similar experience by the military. There are experiences of atomic radiation and radioactive contamination.\nAnd based on these facts documented historically, I built my belief that the United States of America had planned to spread the Corona virus in China as a biological warfare that relieved it from moving any inhabitants, and its profits were invaluable at all levels.\nEven at the level of countries, there are doubts from some countries that Western countries, especially American ones, are behind the spread of this virus in China, and here the question is, what are their goals? What is their interest? What will America gain from weakening China?\nIn fact, the American interest lies in the same goals, namely the weakening of the Chinese economy and then the weakening of the geopolitical competitor, and here it must be noted the fallacy that: “The goal of pharmaceutical companies is to achieve huge profits from vaccines against the virus.” So far, no western party has claimed that it has treatment, but rather internal Chinese bodies affiliated with the Chinese state itself.\nIn the context of the talk, the interest of the outside to weaken China has already affected it, and the manifestations of the effect of the spread of the virus on the reality and future of China, such as countries withdrawing their citizens from China, and cutting land, sea and air flights, from the closest friends to the enemies, such as Russia reducing flights and trains to China. Likewise, Iran, which reflects negatively on the Chinese economy, which disturbs the progress and development of the American competitor and his intelligence services.\nAs for the most important question, which is, what will America gain from weakening China if it is proven by the definitive evidence - that it is from me who is behind the Corna virus? The answer is as follows:\nFirst: To limit the development of Chinese military power, which, in the nature of nature, will not be able to compete with the American military force.\nSecondly, China discouraged its political stances, especially in the outstanding issues between it and America, such as the position on the Taiwan issue, and China’s support for the Iranian nuclear agreement.\nThird: The impact on the Chinese human power, as China is the first global force in terms of human wealth, with a population of about one billion and 300 million people.\nFourth: A direct blow to the human development process in China. According to (researcher Mahmoud Mohamed in his message “Dimensions of the Chinese Rise in the International System and its Repercussions 1991-2010), the Chinese government paid attention to the health of its residents. In 2006, health spending reached 3.6% of The size of the gross domestic product, and the percentage of those enrolled in basic and university education reached 70% of the total population, while the literacy rate for those over fifteen was 90.9%.\nFifth: Directing a severe blow to the development process in general Development in China has focused on three determinants: agricultural development, industrial progress, scientific and technological development. China has paid great attention to scientific and technological research so that it can achieve its aspirations and aspirations for all purposes.\nIn this regard, it must be pointed out what proves the American action against China and its necessity, namely, the strategy of containing China clearly emerged in an orderly fashion by Condoleezza Rice since the beginning of her work as a national security advisor when she announced that China, as a growing and ambitious force, poses a challenge to vital American interests. In the Asia and other regions of the world for these reasons, Rice has called for more US support for India to maintain regional balance in Asia.\nThe result: The work to spread the Corona virus and amplify its negative effects on China is part of an American plan to hit China economically, militarily and culturally within the framework of what is today called the wars of the fourth and fifth generations; The demolition of values and heritage, the demolition of society in general, and the final move away from the direct clash method, and this result has become clear and proven in light of the historical evidence of the American biological experiments, and for the American dealings with the competitors and the rising powers as well, and on this basis and by returning to the imposition In my article, the Corona virus is a form of an American strike against China in order to weaken its power and cause its level of development in general to keep the gap between China and America widening and far, until the ghosts of fears of the \"sleeping dragon\" disappear."}, {"url": "https://www.fondsk.ru/news/2020/03/25/borba-s-koronavirusom-i-bolshoj-brat-50441.html", "title": "Coronavirus and Big Brother - Strategic Culture Foundation", "text": "I keep repeating a simple truth: the owners of money have plans to become masters of the world. To do this, they, in addition to everything, need to establish control over the world's population. Now, when I write these lines, the Earth’s population counter shows that 7 billion 785 million people live on the planet (check with the counter). This is where they need to be established control, excluding one “golden million” - the owners of money themselves with their families.\nBased on the fact that the coronavirus pandemic is a special operation carried out by order of the owners of money, one of its goals is to completely control the entire population of the planet. Daily reports on the spread of the coronavirus pandemic say states are expanding control over citizens. Here is a small overview of achievements in this area, prepared by the authoritative British publication Business Insider, citing data from the expert group Top10VPN. The survey identifies 11 countries that have made the most progress in monitoring the population during the fight against the virus (in three incomplete months of 2020). These are South Korea, Iran, Taiwan, Singapore, Israel, Austria, Poland, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Great Britain.\nSurprisingly, the list does not include China and the United States. True, in relation to the United States, the review says that the US authorities are conducting secret negotiations with Facebook and Google in order to attract them to state programs of surveillance of the population in a pandemic, but Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg denies the fact of such negotiations.\nAccording to Business Insider, South Korea has advanced most in control. They completed the creation of an open access online map. Any person can use it to find out if he has had any intersections with infected people. Each person is being monitored around the clock. Geolocation data and surveillance camera data are used. All transactions with bank cards are tracked, which allows you to accurately determine the place and time of a payment transaction. South Koreans receive SMS messages about newly identified infected citizens. Recipients of messages are advised to familiarize themselves with the routes of movement of the infected object, to be sure that they did not intersect with it anywhere.\nAnd in Taiwan, \"under the hood\" were people who are ordered to be in quarantine. The surveillance object must keep the phone turned on. Turning off the device or leaving the house is recorded, and the police travels to the place. This control model is called \"electronic fence.\" The same \"electronic fences\" are organized in other countries. For example, in Poland, where authorities require phone owners to install special Home Quarantine applications.\nIn Israel and a number of other countries, the emphasis is on monitoring infected citizens or those on the suspect lists. Suspects are caught.\nIn a number of European countries (Austria, Germany, Italy, Belgium), the authorities manage to negotiate with private mobile companies that supply the authorities with geolocation information. This information allows you to identify quarantine violators and detain potentially infected people. By March 18, in Italy, such information allowed to identify 40 thousand violators.\nIn parallel with this, global giants of private business, intergovernmental organizations, charitable foundations, and various NGOs are building a supranational system of monitoring and control.\nOf particular note is the organization ID2020. This project, supported by the United Nations, is part of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals initiative. The goal of the project is to provide a digital identifier (ID) to the planet’s inhabitants by the end of the third decade of the 21st century. By the end of 2020, it is planned to complete the creation of an experimental version of the ID2020 platform. The project is advertised as a manifestation of the care of its initiators about humanity. So, today in the world there are tens of millions of refugees, many of whom left their homeland without any documents. To settle in new places in such cases is difficult. But in total, experts calculated that 1.1 billion people live without documents in the world. ID2020 proposes the creation of a single data bank, where personal data of each person will be located. And each person will have access to them. The access key can be biometric data or a microchip implanted in the human body. The initiators of the project emphasize that personal data will be available only to this person, although other individuals and organizations can obtain the right of access. Blockchain technologies run in cryptocurrency projects should give additional guarantees to citizens.\nIf you look closely at ID2020, it turns out that this is a project to build a digital concentration camp as part of a new world order, which the English writer Aldous Huxley called \"a brave new world.\" I talked a lot about this and wrote, here I will limit myself to referring to my book: “The World Under Hypnosis of Figures, or The Road to an Electronic Concentration Camp” (M .: Library of REO named after S.F. Sharapov, 2018). There I decipher the crafty calls of the world elite for the speedy digitalization of life and the state. Instead of the promised conveniences and benefits, a digital mousetrap awaits people.\nThe ID2020 project is a public-private partnership. Its participants are such business giants as Microsoft, Accenture, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Cisco Systems. The project is associated with Bill Gates, who has long been among the three richest people in America. He is the founder, co-owner and head of Microsoft Corporation, but in early 2020 he left the company’s capital. This is due to the fact that back in 2000, Bill and Hillary Clinton established a charitable organization - the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Today it is the largest charitable foundation in America with assets of more than $ 50 billion. The main theme of the Fund was viral diseases, financing for the development of new vaccines and the supply of vaccines to the poorest countries. However, many of the vaccines promoted by the Foundation do not save people, but send them to the other world. This side of the charitable work of billionaire Gates is well known to specialists. For those interested I can recommend the book by Tatyana Gracheva “When power is not from God. Algorithms of geopolitics and strategies of secret wars of the world behind the scenes ”(chapter“ Vaccines are weapons of mass destruction ”).\nIn recent years, Bill Gates has joined two areas of his interests: digital technology and vaccines. In September 2019, an ID2020 meeting was held in New York under the motto “Rising to the Good ID Challenge”. From the materials of the meeting it follows that the best moments for “good identification” are the birth of a person and a pandemic. The first one is clear: the child must be digitally identified in the hospital. However, 99 percent of people safely avoided this. For them, the best moment to be included in the global identification system is a pandemic.\nAt a meeting in New York last September, it was announced that a pilot digital identification project in 2020 will be implemented in Bangladesh, with many ID2020 partners participating. One of them is the GAVI - Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization). GAVI has the status of public-private partnership, which is engaged in \"immunization for all.\" Among the main partners of GAVI are WHO, UNICEF, other intergovernmental organizations, and the World Bank. And, of course, the global giants of the pharmaceutical business producing vaccines.\nOn October 18, 2019, a meeting was held in Baltimore at the Johns Hopkins Medical Center, sponsored by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Gates Foundation. All key figures of the GAVI and ID2020 projects participated. The main event at the meeting was a computer simulation of a pandemic based on the Johns Hopkins Center. 65 million deaths were modeled.\nThe discussion of the modeling results in Baltimore was held in January 2020 at the WEF annual closed-door WEF summit in Davos. Just at that moment when the epidemic of coronavirus flared up in Wuhan.\nAnd someone will risk asserting that the events that have been compressed for several months (meetings in New York and Baltimore, discussion of the pandemic modeling in Davos, the coronavirus epidemic in China) are random coincidences in time? No! These were the stages of preparation and the beginning of the special operation of the owners of money.\nAnd the last one. GAVI and pharmaceutical companies have already switched to using a new generation of vaccines based on nanotechnology. Today, on this basis, you can create microscopic chips the size of a speck of dust, nano-microchips. Mass vaccination of the population will mean massive chipization. True, the \"benefactors\" of the Gates Foundation, GAVI and ID2020 do not talk about this.\nI first read about nano-vaccines a dozen years ago, in 2009, in the American electronic publication Prevent Disease. Com in Are Populations Being Primed For Nano-Microchips Inside Vaccines? (Is the population pushing for the adoption of nanomicrochips hidden in vaccines?). Today, a new generation of nano-vaccines has already been developed, including “under the coronavirus”. The Gates Foundation, GAVI and ID2020 are waiting for the team of owners of money to begin the chipization of mankind.\nФото: REUTERS/Andrew Kelly"}, {"url": "http://sst.sy/290686", "title": "New conspiracy theory: Bill Gates behind the genesis and spread of the Corona virus", "text": "New conspiracy theory: Bill Gates behind the origins and spread of the Coronavirus\nRoger Stone suggested on Monday that Bill Gates might have had a hand in creating the Corona virus and spreading the pandemic throughout the world. Former Donald Trump adviser indicated that American billionaire Bill Gates might have done this so he could grow microchips in people's heads to distinguish who was tested for COVID-19 and not tested.\nStone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM waves, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: \"Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate.\" He added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to sow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations. According to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is linked to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain \"mandatory vaccinations.\" Stone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations. Gates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis such as coronaviruses, to the extent of recent talk about Gates's prediction of the disease 3 years ago. As the Washington Times reported, Gates announced earlier this month that his charitable organization would invest billions of dollars in factories that would focus on developing many vaccines."}, {"url": "https://www.fondsk.ru/news/2020/03/31/v-italjanskom-parlamente-spuskajut-flag-evropejskogo-souza-50502.html", "title": "European Union flag lowered in Italian parliament - Strategic Culture Fund", "text": "On March 30, Fabio Rampelli, deputy chairman of the Italian parliament, removed the European Union flag in his office and hoisted the Italian tricolor in his place.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said this after reports appeared that in the south of the country there was not enough food, but people did not have enough money.\nPrime Minister of Italy J. Conte\nFor the first time in the European Union, food cards are introduced.\nThe Italian edition of the American newspaper The Huffington Post posted a report “Fear becomes anger” from its correspondent from southern Italy. He writes: “We want to eat,” sounds a scream, now a whisper, then the anger of those who demand and grab products without payment, because they cannot pay for them. How can I eat if you do not have a salary? And you, the state, should give me this money, otherwise I have the right to grab food from the shelves. \" Caution! The situation is changing, not just statistics. Our country has stopped singing from the balconies ... \"\nI managed to get in touch with my friends in Italy, where I worked for several years. Here are a few opinions.\n“There are many people who are left without funds, in a desperate situation, they are struggling to survive,” says Angelo Tantaro, director of the Sardinian short film festival. “They cannot buy food, they are desperate ... We hope for the solidarity of friendly countries such as Russia, China, Cuba, Albania.”\n“Since most of the production facilities were closed, many were without money, they cannot buy food, and this could trigger a rebellion mechanism,” says Fabrizio Lo Bello, owner of the baby food factory in Syracuse in Sicily. - It seems that the government has allocated funds for communes in an emergency, let's hope that these funds will come. Moreover, we already know well that Russia is close! ”\n“There is a critical situation in Italy,” says Carlo Fredduzzi, director of the Institute of Russian Language and Culture in Rome. - Despite the fact that at first the virus hit the north of the country, protests begin in the southern regions. They write that various mafias are now making billions on frauds with protective masks, medical equipment, antiviral sprays, oxygen cylinders, and medicines. They are then sold on the black market at fabulous prices or exported to other countries ... All newspapers - government and opposition - are attacking the European Union .... My wife and I have taken refuge in our house in the suburbs of Rome since January and we go out just to buy food. You must have a special certificate with you, which is constantly changing. If the police \"catch\" you without this document in its latest edition, you face a fine of up to 5 thousand euros. \"\nStreet in Naples\nThe problem is not only facing Italy. The UN warned that due to the widespread closure of borders in the coming months, the entire European Union may face food shortages. The point is not only that production stopped and many go broke. Farmers in rich countries are used to relying on the cheap labor of seasonal workers from Eastern Europe - Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine. Now the stream of migrant workers is blocked, and the time of the first harvest is approaching. In Italy, a shortage of 50 thousand workers is predicted this spring. France needs 200 thousand seasonal workers on farms, Germany - 300 thousand.\n“We are at war,” said the leader of the Forward Italy! Party, former long-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. “And the future of the EU is in jeopardy.”\nGuy Verhofstadt\n“The crisis with the coronavirus testifies to the collapse of Europe,” says former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt in an interview with the Stampa newspaper. - Since the end of January, that is, since the closure of the Chinese city of Wuhan, we daily receive confirmation of this. Absolutely all European citizens watched on their television screens the daily development of the crisis, in which the national authorities took disparate half measures, although we all know that a pandemic requires a single decision center and a single line of control. A pandemic is not \"like a war.\" She is war. And in the last eight weeks in Europe we have seen a different picture: 28 decision centers, 28 control lines. ”\nNote: the former Belgian prime minister interprets exactly the same thing that is said by the former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, \"the peddler of the global elite's mentality.\"\nGiulio Tremonti\nAnd more and more European politicians are repeating the words of the former Minister of Economy of Italy Giulio Tremonti: “Globalization is over. What happened before, he notes, was called the world order. Now there’s a risk of a global mess. ” Behind these words is the same call for the creation of a world government subjugating the (former) sovereign nation-states."}, {"url": "https://www.alalamtv.net/news/4810731/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%82%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7", "title": "Exciting report throws oil on fire over Corona source theory - Al-Alam news channel", "text": "The World - Health\nThis controversy escalated, especially between the United States and China, to the highest levels, as US President Donald Trump described it as a Chinese virus, while Beijing suspected that he was an American.\nAccording to Russia Today, despite the fact that scientists and specialists are now busy combating this deadly epidemic, regardless of its source, and some of them confirm that there are no indications of its creation and that it is a \"natural\" virus known \"pedigree\", exposed to a mutation that turned it into a \"killer\" who has the ability to Penetration of human cells, but a report published by the American journal, Nature, known for its sobriety, still threw more oil on \"conspiracy theory\" oil.\nThis report was published on November 12, 2015, and reported that US scientists have created in the laboratory a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats in connection with a virus that causes SARS, that is, acute respiratory syndrome.\nThe magazine revealed about 5 years ago that scientists had examined a virus called \"SHC014\", which was found in horseshoe bats in China.\nThese scientists combined the surface protein of \"SHC014\" with the SARS virus, and came out with a new virus that provided the surface protein with a structure that helps it penetrate into the cells of the human respiratory system. It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\nIn this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans.\nResearchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than previously thought.\"\nIn contrast, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify \"potential risks\".\nSimon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on the news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: \"If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.\"\nIn October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on \"job promotion\", especially those causing serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans."}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFwa0N35Nz0", "title": "Viral protests in Ukraine.

The organizers of the protest, a group called the \"Communication Bureau for Democratic Resistance\", say on their website that they stand for \"the constitution, liberal rights and democratic shaping of the new economic rules by the people themselves\". The website asked participants to keep a distance of two meters from each other and to wear face masks. It was suggested that demonstrators should ask the police to provide these masks and said they were \"in short supply\". It is the fourth weekend in a row that the group has called for protests in Berlin and other German cities.\nEurope is slowly waking up from the COVID-19 nightmare and finding itself in the biggest recession it ever faced before. They bombarded us with figures showing deaths and infected people, and we now see discussion about human rights abuses, economy figures, which results in social unrest and upheaval , at least in Germany and the Netherlands, the countries least affected, if we compare them with Italy, Spain and France. T he European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Paolo Gentiloni , warned that € 1.5 trillion euros could be needed to “ deal with the crisis“. He said that Europe is going through the “ worst crisis ” since WWII, which threatens the very existence of the EU as a single economic and political entity. The Eurogroup – the finance ministers of the Eurozone nations – have so far allocated only €500 billion Euros for funding medical expenses and assisting small- and medium-sized enterprises, leaving Europe in need of around €1 trillion euros more. That is the financial side of the crisis, Europe is nearly bankrupt. The constitutions of various EU-member countries are also under threat , human rights are abused, as nearly all our constitutional rights have been taken away . Our income, the majority of small businesses and laborors on small or low-paid jobs, are closed, or without work, and in half of the cases, they received some state help, but the majority is still waiting for help. The right to demonstrat e is gone, visiting your elderly parents is forbidden, children haven't been going to school for more than over a month already. Of course, when this pandemic kills millions , it‘s a logic al thing to do. But with only thousands (of course very terrible) of people who died in each country, mainly the elderly, the measures taken ha ve d one a lot of harm financially and have taken our constitutional rights. Many videos and news emerge in the regular MSM where, for instance in the Netherlands, they use entertainment buildings , such as where the E urovision song contest would take place. They turned this place into a medical facility for COVID-19 patients, but until today not a single patient was delivered to this place. In Germany, according to the latest statistics on the regular MSM: 150,000 beds are empty , these beds are for patients with other diseases like cancer and heart diseases. The doctors and nurses responsible for these departments have been sent home . The COVID-19 facilities are 140,000 beds , approximately 25% are used, the other beds are still waiting for patients. Where people are afraid to visit their general practitioner, one-third fewer patients are received. People who are afraid of the medical costs and COVID-19 will bring the health system in a difficult financial situation. Germany is trying to find a “new economy”, masks are the new hype, every Bundesland is trying to get them, and even if there is a lack of them, they force the people, by law, to wear one. The Netherlands is facing another problem: the wildfires about 5G cell towers, nearly every day a tower is set on fire. These phenomena have swept the Netherlands, the UK and recently Belgium. The reason is the lack of information and a real discussion between governments and their citizens, a real debate is needed to see if the people want 5G and a good explanation of the dangers or if there is no danger at all should be provided to them. Another problem is the exorbitant fines in Germany and the Netherlands, where people have less or no income but should still pay fines. The fines start at € 150 Euros, also part of “the new economy”. Italy and Spain got hit the hardest with COVID-19. Italy has one of the oldest populations in the world, but they got no help from their rich neighbors, EU countries like Germany and the Netherlands, but from Russia Cuba and China , which the EU's MSM regularly tried to portray as a propaganda stunt, and sure, Russia and Cuba would present the bill. These are words from the most capitalistic countries, once united in the EU, to blame countries who come to help. The opposite situation would be much worse, when the EU would come and help , the amounts they would ask would be staggeringly high. Wars in the Middle East are very costly for the EU, the US was forcing NATO to join in bombing Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, and Syria. The EU will not longer exist as we once knew and Europe, when it will not reverse their constitutional and economic measures, will collapse financially and is heading for more unrest and upheaval."}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/rtarabic.ru/videos/213098746732781/", "title": "RT Arabic - Russia fended off a pandemic stronger than SK", "text": "See more of RT Arabic on Facebook\nLog In\nor Create New Account\nSee more of RT Arabic on Facebook\nCreate New Account\nor\nNot Now"}, {"url": "https://sputnik-ossetia.ru/columnists/20200229/10161520/Virus-stal-oruzhiem-kotoroe-obrushit-imperiyu.html", "title": "The virus has become a weapon that will bring down an empire", "text": "If you look at the situation a little deeper, then everything becomes even sadder, because it turns out that using the epidemic as an information weapon is not only an element of the external, but also an element of the internal political struggle of our esteemed Western partners.\nThis problem is most directly related to Russia: we are part of the global economy, and American and European politicians are now mainly engaged in rescuing stock markets and finding the guilty, and not fighting the infection.\nThe Hill’s specialized political publication reports on concerns overseas political leaders: “President Trump on Wednesday accused Speaker (Congress) Nancy Pelosi of trying to cause panic over the coronavirus, saying she doesn't know what she’s talking about (when discussing an epidemic. - Approx.). \"She's trying to create panic,\" Trump told reporters at a White House briefing (which had been called) to discuss the virus, adding that there was no reason for (panic). \"\nThe president himself seems to be more concerned about the fall of the stock market than a viral infection. And it can be understood: inexorable statistics indicate that the behavior of financial markets in the pre-election year greatly affects the preferences of voters, which means that the market needs to be supported by any means. It is this interpretation of the president’s actions that can be seen from his statements. And the same sources say the American media, for example, The Washington Post: \"Although he spent the last two days in India, Trump has closely watched the stock market crashes and believes that the tough warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scared investors.\"\nAs president of the reality control panel, the US president prefers to use Twitter, where he already wrote that “the market is starting to look very good,” probably alluding to the fact that now it’s worth not panicking, but buying shares of American companies.\nWhite House Economic Advisor Larry Cadlow called for buying stocks in almost direct text, but for some reason, investors prefer to buy gold.\nIn this context, it is difficult to disagree with the observation of the chief editor of the Chinese foreign policy publication Global Times, who tweeted: “I think that now the United States is a country with potentially great uncertainty. Many doubt that there are only 57 cases of coronavirus in the United States. \"there is a problem with the diagnosis. Covid-19 is probably the most significant unknown (factor) for the US economy and the US presidential election.\"\nThe statement of the influential Chinese media specialist reads, among other things, a veiled hint that the American media very actively promoted throws aimed at discrediting the actions of official Beijing and criticizing the decisive measures that the Chinese authorities took to repay the epidemic. When the time came for Washington (as well as some European capitals) to demonstrate a master class in applied epidemiology, the results weren’t very impressive.\nCNBC’s US business channel reports: “Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg has posted a video that severely criticizes President Donald Trump’s reaction to the spread of coronavirus. <...>\" The president fired a pandemic chief specialist two years ago, Bloomberg said. “There is no one here who could calculate what the hell we should do.”\nTrump fans are not indebted: American media report that \"some supporters of President Donald Trump see a more important threat than the spread of the extremely contagious new coronavirus: a conspiracy of representatives of the\" deep state \"to use the virus against the president.\"\nIn Europe, the situation is not much better. For example, in Italy there is a political battle in full because of the unwillingness of the country's government to close the borders (despite the fact that the infection has already infiltrated Italy), and Time notes that Prime Minister Giuseppe Conti is “surprised” by how quickly the number of cases grows.\nAccording to the Brussels media, the fragile truce between rival political parties in Rome was disrupted immediately after the prime minister announced that the outbreak of coronavirus in the north of the country was probably due to a gross violation of the rules and procedures of a hospital in Lombardy.\nOn the example of European and American reaction, one can see a radical difference between the \"collective West\" and other countries: the readiness to mobilize and unite society and the political class in the face of a common threat is at an incredibly low level. In any serious crisis, the political and economic system, deprived of the ability to mobilize, will simply fall apart.\nRegardless of how many deaths and the magnitude of economic damage will all end now, the forecast for the future is not encouraging: we can forget about full-fledged and bona fide international and inter-party cooperation for the sake of saving human lives. For the opportunity to earn domestic and foreign policy points is much more important. I would like to believe in the best, but there is a risk that the continuation of this crisis will take place precisely in the field of propaganda and information wars: sooner or later, Western politicians may come to the conclusion that it would be nice to blame all the problems associated with the epidemic on some external enemy. It is possible that China will be chosen as a candidate for the source of all evils, although it cannot be ruled out that theories about the “Russian conspiracy” will go into action this time too."}, {"url": "https://nna.iq/2020/04/09/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%81-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%91%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%B8%D9%87/", "title": "Report: America may unintentionally stand behind the appearance of the Coronavirus in Wuhan", "text": "Follow-up: The Palm Agency\nA report published on the Canadian website concluded that the United States may unintentionally stop the emergence of the emerging corona virus \"Covid-19\" in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\nAnd a former Professor at the University of Shanghai, Larry Romanov, stated in a report published by the Canadian Globalresearch, that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered last summer to close a large military biological laboratory at Fort Detrick base in Maryland, in anticipation of possible leaks.\nAfter the move, the United States last August witnessed a wave of pneumonia and similar diseases, and this was attributed to the repercussions of electronic cigarettes, but this hypothesis raised the suspicions of some experts.\nAfter that, media and activists in China reported that five of the Americans who participated in the international military games competitions hosted by Wuhan last October were infected with unspecified infection.\nChinese sources suggested that this mysterious disease was in fact \"Covid-19\", which he transferred to Wuhan, an American military, and he may have been infected by an accident not announced in Fort Detrick, and he was not diagnosed because of the absence of any concrete symptoms.\nSource: Globalresearch + Russian Channel 1, April 9, 2020"}, {"url": "https://fr.sputniknews.com/international/202003181043321489-obsession-russophobe-le-kremlin-recuse-les-accusations-de-desinformation-sur-le-covid-19-visant-la/", "title": "\"Russophobic obsession\": the Kremlin denies accusations of disinformation on the Covid-19 targeting the Russian press", "text": "International 20:21 18.03.2020 (updated 20:22 18.03.2020) Short URL\nhttps://cdnfr7.img.sputniknews.com/img/104245/77/1042457733_0:282:3140:2048_1200x675_80_0_0_16c4aaed66b271eddc3461c0cd298210.jpg\nSputnik france\nhttps://cdnfr8.img.sputniknews.com/i/logo.png\nSputnik\nhttps://cdnfr8.img.sputniknews.com/i/logo.png\nhttps://fr.sputniknews.com/international/202003181043321489-obsession-russophobe-le-kremlin-recuse-les-accusations-de-desinformation-sur-le-covid-19-visant-la/\nStressing that the allegations of misinformation about the Covid-19 targeting the Russian media were unfounded and not based on any concrete example, the spokesperson for the Russian presidency spoke of \"a Russophobic obsession\".\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov reacted to claims in a recent report by the European External Action Service that Russia is misinforming about the coronavirus.\n\"I cannot comment on this from a common sense point of view,\" he said, adding that the document contained no concrete examples, nor any reference to any specific media. \"These are again unfounded allegations.\"\nThe report says that the Russian media has launched a disinformation campaign to worsen the Covid-19 crisis in Western countries.\n\"Given the current situation, the Russophobic obsession should have decreased, but apparently this is not the case,\" he added.\n\"Misinformation campaign\"\n©\nAP Photo / Patrick Ngugi\nEarlier, the Financial Times newspaper released extracts from the report.

A total of 106 people died of the disease. 976 patients remained in critical conditions. 6,973 people were suspected of being infected, while 4,515 cases were confirmed.\nTroops clad in hazmat suits, with automatic rifles were deployed, and namely in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province.

The SATRS hospital featured individual isolation units that looked like rows of tiny cabins.\nOn January 26, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced that China started to develop vaccine for the novel coronavirus after successfully isolating the first strain of the virus.\nAll people entering and leaving China are having their temperature measured.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most people get infected with coronaviruses at one point in their lives, but symptoms are typically mild to moderate. In some cases, the viruses can cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis.\nThese are more common in animals, and only a handful are known to affect humans, as is the case now. This is what happened with the coronaviruses known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, between 2012-17) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov, 2002-3), both of which are known to cause more severe symptoms.\nThe 2019-nCoV virus has spread, at a relatively rapid pace. The first case was reported on December 31st, 2019, in Wuhan, China. The first cured individual, named Chen, a 56-year old woman was reported by Chinese authorities, as per Chinese media. She spent 2 weeks in hospital and was fully cured.\nSince then, the virus has appeared in several other countries, including Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. The first U.S. case was confirmed on January 21st in a man in Washington state who had recently traveled to Wuhan. On January 24th, officials confirmed a second case in a woman from Chicago who had also recently traveled to the Chinese city. On January 24th, the first three cases were confirmed in France, with two patients being hospitalised in Paris and the other in the southwestern city of Bordeaux. Australia also confirmed its first case of the virus. On January 28th, three suspected cases of the coronavirus were reported in the Indian capital.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus an “emergency in China,” but not an international concern.\nAccording to the Imperial College London, self-sustaining human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is the only plausible explanation of the scale of the outbreak in Wuhan. The released report estimates that on average, each case infected 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5) other people up to 18th January 2020. For comparison, during the SARS outbreak each case infected from 2.0 to 3.5 other people.\n“This implies that control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak. It is likely, based on the experience of SARS and MERS-CoV, that the number of secondary cases caused by a case of 2019-nCoV is highly variable – with many cases causing no secondary infections, and a few causing many. Whether transmission is continuing at the same rate currently depends on the effectiveness of current control measures implemented in China and the extent to which the populations of affected areas have adopted risk-reducing behaviours,” the report reads.\nSo far, the 2019-nCoV mortality rate has been approximately 2.35%. Therefore, the 2019-nCoV speed of spreading, as well as the fatality percentage is in reality lower than SARS, which took place in 2002-3, also in China. In total, there were 8098 confirmed cases of SARS, with a mortality rate of 9.6%. The virus was contacted from bats. The MERS, which spread in the Middle East, between 2012-17, had a confirmed number of 2,000 infected, and a mortality rate of 36%. It was contacted from camels.\nThe Chinese government is taking extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of the 2019-nCoV. Military men in biological protection suits, blocked cities, and hospital construction efforts allow mainstream media outlets to paint an apocalyptic picture of the developments, claiming a pseudo-apocalyptic endemic that would threaten hundreds of thousands, if not millions. Countries such as the UK, the US, and others are carrying out coronavirus tests of various individuals. Mostly of Chinese origin, or those that have recently been to China.\nOne of the speculations is that the 2019-nCoV outbreak is a result of the leak from a secret (not very) laboratory. One of the Chinese BSL-4 rated labs (highest level of biological safety) is located in Wuhan.\n“A laboratory in Wuhan is on the cusp of being cleared to work with the world’s most dangerous pathogens. The move is part of a plan to build between five and seven biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) labs across the Chinese mainland by 2025, and has generated much excitement, as well as some concerns.\nSome scientists outside China worry about pathogens escaping, and the addition of a biological dimension to geopolitical tensions between China and other nations. But Chinese microbiologists are celebrating their entrance to the elite cadre empowered to wrestle with the world’s greatest biological threats,” The Nature article from February 2017 starts.\nRegardless facts, speculations of the biolab in Wuhan became pretty popular, claiming that this is, in fact, a real-life Resident Evil scenario, and its infamous Umbrella Corporation, minus people turning into mindless zombies roaming the streets.\nAnother popular culture comparison is that with the popular game Plague Inc., and that as soon as Greenland hears a Chinese man has sneezed at an airport and it’s closed its borders, and that every other country should follow suit.\nThe media hysteria has gone so far that the developer of Plague Inc., Ndemic Creations, issued a statement saying that their game is realistic, but not with the aim to sensationalize serious world issues. It warned that this is, in fact a game, and not a scientific model.\nOur website is currently offline due to very high player numbers.

(@NdemicCreations) January 24, 2020\nRather dark memes are on the rise, with there even being a specific subreddit focused on coronavirus jokes. Most are harmless jokes, but many of them are tasteless, but they also serve the purpose of presenting China in a light that it is losing grip of the situation.\nThe apocalyptic coverage of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China demonstrates how mainstream media outlets and social media platforms shape the audience’s perception of reality. While the Chinese government appears to be employing needed measures to contain the outbreak and prevent the virus spread, the MSM uses this measures to feed the audience with speculations that this is a signal of the Chinese inability to keep the situation under control.\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n- Coronavirus Claims 81, As China Ramps Up Measures To Curb Spreading\nDonate"}, {"url": "https://www.alalamtv.net/news/4839311/%D9%87%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%87%D9%85-%D9%8A%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%8A-%D8%B3%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%B6%D8%AF-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7", "title": "This important nutrient contains the secret of immunity against corona", "text": "World - Europe\nDuring one of her televised medical programs, Malysheva said: \"Food products that contain large amounts of zinc are necessary to activate the so-called killer cells in the body.

Until recently, such a statement was considered nothing more than a rumor spread by supporters of various conspiracy theories. However, on the eve of the broadcast of \"Russia 24\" this idea was expressed by the President of the National Medical Chamber Leonid Roshal. Life understood why scientists and doctors are increasingly talking about coronavirus as a biological weapon and whether the world is threatened with extinction from an artificially created virus.\nRehearsal of war\n“In fact, today it’s a (coronavirus pandemic. - Note. Life) rehearsal for biological warfare,” Roshal said in an interview. - We are only talking about this now, we are not talking about nuclear war, we are not talking about terrorism. And how general is the health care of the world for this, and how ready are we for it. And we must have reasonable sufficiency.\nThe current situation, he believes, shows the readiness of medical departments around the world for such large-scale biological disasters. And \"the reduction of beds carried out, the reduction of personnel in healthcare, optimization - from this point of view, this is not entirely good.\"\nViral Geopolitics\nNo matter how terrifying the idea that someone will benefit from destroying half of humanity, it finds its supporters, including eminent world experts. One of them is Grigor Grigoryan, an international expert on the control of zoonotic diseases and the organization of veterinary health care, the leader of the \"One Health\" coalition (Armenia).\n- The information available today on the global epidemiological situation with the infection caused by the new coronavirus CoViD-19 suggests that it did not work out, and, let’s say, it was \"put together\" for a specific purpose and that the situation was skillfully \"directed\" towards this goal “He said in an interview with EurAsia Daily.\nPhoto © TASS / EPA / Sebastiao Moreira\n“The main driving mechanism and lever of this scenario is biological weapons and the global panic caused by these weapons, which allows the authors of this process to manage geopolitics at the global level,” added Grigoryan.\nReleased from the laboratory\nIn his interview, Grigoryan also makes another terrible assumption: the virus has an artificial origin.\n“If CoViD-19 were of natural origin,” he says, “then Chinese scientists would have already distinguished it from animal populations that own the virus in nature.” Since such isolation has not yet been achieved, I consider the allegations about the natural nature of the new coronavirus as contradicting the generally accepted epidemiology of zoonotic pathogens (originating from animals. - Life) in general, and zoonotic coronaviruses in particular, the expert explained.\nIn support of this \"theory\" can be found a publication in the journal Nature. Dated November 2015, it talks about the experiments started in 2014 with the coronavirus. Scientists from the University of North Carolina then studied the SHC014 Chinese bat coronavirus, which is still harmless to humans, and combined it with SARS (SARS virus). Scientists, as usual, acted \"for good\", trying to understand whether a zoonotic pathogen mutation is possible and whether it will be dangerous for people. However, in 2014, the US government announced a moratorium on research funding that included mutations in influenza viruses, MERS, and SARS. Other laboratories quickly found other laboratories ... in Wuhan. According to RIA Novosti, as early as 2018, Xinhua reported on studies at the Wuhan Institute of Virology Virology of the immune mechanisms of bats, which for a long time can be carriers of viruses, but not hurt.\nPhoto © TASS / EPA / Sebastiao Moreira\nScientists from India have also confirmed the theory of the origin of the virus in a laboratory in Wuhan. They found that coronavirus has a strange resemblance to HIV. The Wuhan virus contains four inserts of human immunodeficiency virus. \"The amino acid residues of each of them are identical or similar to the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag,\" the document says. -1 is unlikely to be random in nature. \"\n“We decrypted the aligned gene and found that these inserts are present in all 2019-nCoV viruses from Wuhan, except for the mother bat 2019-nCoV virus,” the authors of the study note.\nWho is behind the pandemic?\nFrom the very first minutes of the virus, most Western media rushed to express the idea of a virus leaking from a laboratory in Wuhan. And, indeed, the Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is located very close to the very fish market, from which it is believed that the spread of the virus around the world began.\nBut the Chinese immediately took up a defensive position. Celestial Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijiang tweeted, citing an article from the Center for Globalization Research that the virus was actually created in the United States. The US military allegedly brought the virus to China during the World Military Games, which were held from October 18 to October 27, 2019.\nPhoto © TASS / ZUMA\nAccording to the scientist whose words appear in the article, the first outbreak of coronavirus was the death of electronic cigarettes that swept the United States last August: \"Symptoms and conditions could not be explained by electronic cigarettes.\" After some time, it became clear that in Wuhan there are far from one viral laboratory. Another research center, which, according to the Zvezda channel, \"exists on the money of the famous banker George Soros,\" is also studying dangerous viruses.\nHowever, this video really makes the blood colder.\nIn it, in 2015, Bill Gates told why mankind would die. Probably, no one would have paid attention to this recording five years ago if it had not been for another important event organized with the participation of his foundation. \"Event 201\" (Eng. - Event 201) was held in October 2019 in New York. The powers that be were discussing nothing but the coronavirus pandemic. It was important for them to understand the possibilities of public-private partnerships \"in response to a severe pandemic in order to reduce large-scale economic and social consequences.\" Interestingly, under the scenario of \"exercises\" in the world 65 million people died.

(Highlight from translator.)\nThis was stated by Igor Nyikulin, a former UN expert on bacteriological weapons, in the \"Politics\". publication.\nInformation war during the “plague”\nAs the Global Times c. Chinese National Daily reports on March 15 that a petition appeared on the White House website demanding that U.S. authorities provide information to the Pentagon about its secret laboratory where research into infectious diseases is underway.\nIt’s the “Walter Reed” Military Science Research Center, located in Fort Detrick, Maryland. Unofficially, this center is called the American “Witch Kitchen”. Similar to the “731 team,” the special army of the Japanese army in which biological weapons were developed, manufactured, and tested in practice during World War II. (1) And, as the Global Times notes, U.S. scientists are working on similar developments in Fort Detrick. Among other things, the COVID-19 coronavirus was born there. By now, there is a flare-up of infections in virtually every corner of the world.\nThe fact that the infection is of American origin has also been officially reported by the Chinese authorities. Among other things, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Li-chien announced that it was the U.S. military that brought the coronavirus to Wuhan. That’s why the spokesman called on the United States to confess color, publish all the data, and provide an explanation. In response, the U.S. State Department immediately appointed Chinese Ambassador Cuj Tien-kaj, with whom he had an extremely tough discussion. As political scientist Sergei Markov, director of the Institute for Political Research, explained in a conversation with a staff member of “PoliticoScience,” the Chinese side’s comments seem legitimate and well-founded. At the very least, this suggests how hardened US policy has been in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.\n“America is now going through an active information war against China. And in the context of this, the coronavirus is consciously called “Chinese”. It is clear why this is happening. Namely, to emphasize this: everything bad comes from China. The Chinese are therefore right to ask the question: is this disease not really of American origin? ” - notes the expert.\nAs he said, the Chinese authorities most likely do not yet have clear, substantiated evidence to support their words. However, the fact that Americans have something to do with the development of this bacteriological weapon is suggested by indirect facts that must be made public.\nIn Wuhan, in the area of the former (American) consulate, the Chinese found empty boxes labeled “bacteriological danger”. Again, just a legitimate question: don’t these found objects have anything to do with the coronavirus? Theoretically, of course, you can. Even if it is not the virus itself, but possibly some of its components. And the Chinese are very right to put such issues into public debate, ”the political scientist believes.\nIt should be noted that the Americans themselves provided a reason to start accusing them. For example, Robert Redfield, head of the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), said in a speech to the U.S. House of Representatives that some of the deceased Americans who were diagnosed with influenza had been diagnosed with coronavirus in post-mortem examinations. This suggests that that particular, infamous “zero patient” (i.e., the first infected patient to be found during epidemiological investigations) was in fact American.\nAll roads lead to Fort Detrick\nOn Tuesday, March 17, the Associated Press reported good news for everyone: a clinical trial of an experimental vaccine against the coronavirus has taken place in Seattle, USA. The antibody, which is supposed to be the savior of all mankind, has already begun to be applied to volunteers.\nHowever, the news, which is causing general cheering, also raises certain questions. Today, probably all laboratories around the world are working on the COVID-19 vaccine. Experts unanimously state that it takes a minimum of one year to complete the preparation. The question arises: how did the Americans manage to get, as they say, an effective antibody in such a short time?\n“If the Americans developed and created the coronavirus, it makes sense that, at the same time, they developed a vaccine against it, that is, an antivirus. This is always the case when a strain of an artificial disease or the like is bred. Especially since the epidemic has reached its peak in the United States itself, ”says Sergei Markov.\nAs Igor Nyikulin, a former member of the UN Biological and Chemical Weapons Commission, said in a conversation with a “Political Trouble” staff member, this coronavirus infection was indeed bred in the United States. That was five years ago in Fort Detrick.\n“In 2015, Nature. (2) published an article about a successful experiment with a modified coronavirus from Chinese bats in Fort Detrick, USA. This virus is now able to enter human cells without the mediation of an animal. However, the same article also mentioned that the authors of the article themselves consider such experiments to be extremely dangerous, ”explains Nyikulin.\nThe expert stressed that back in the year 2015, according to former German Deputy Secretary of Defense Willy Wimmer, the Americans had protected the patent for the coronavirus thus obtained. Now, however, whether intentionally or accidentally, the virus has escaped.\n“Last year, around August 5, the New York Times reported that, for security reasons, the laboratory in Fort Detrick had been closed. And the same New York Times had already announced on August 31 that something strange had struck its head in the United States - by that time, 215 had become ill. Slightly less than two weeks later, Donald Trump convened a deliberation for this reason, as the number of illnesses exceeded 500. As a former UN staff member notes, by then some people, including U.S. Army soldiers, had lost their lives.\nIn this way, the statements of the Chinese authorities seem more than logical. Plus, to get the virus to China, the Americans didn’t even need to work out any complicated operations. It was enough to send infected people to the world’s largest international sports meeting for soldiers\n“At the end of October, International War Games took place in Wuhan, China. This crowded American delegation was attended by about 200 soldiers. And the Chinese now suspect that it was they who brought the virus. As the first patient was found in Wuhan on November 17th. That is, it is at the end of the incubation period of this type of coronavirus. In other words, everything looks very logical. There is nothing in this version to suggest conspiracy theory, as all the data comes from open sources, ”Nyikulin believes.\nUndoubtedly, this version, like any other, requires detailed investigation and reliable evidence. But even now, several facts immediately point to the likely motives of the United States. Washington got at least another trump in its hands in the information war against China and was able to deal a delicate blow to its economy.\nWhether this is a leak or not is what the Americans themselves say. We do not know, for example, whether the virus was delivered to China by diplomatic mail. But I think it's obvious that it originated in America, ”concludes Nyikulin.\nEarlier, Brazilian analyst Lucas Leyros explained that the United States has used an outbreak of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus epidemic as a means of a hybrid war against China.\nKonstantin Lipavsky\nNotes:\n(1) Such centers operated in the Japanese-occupied territories of China. The chemical weapons produced and tested there were tested on Chinese citizens, Soviet, Mongolian and other nationalities taken prisoner of war. The victims were then killed if they did not die of the disease caused by the artificial infection. Victims with a particularly hardy, resilient organism, if they survived one infection, tried another, a third, and so on. also - until they were done.\n(2) Science Journal in the United States Not a word about the American-made coronavirus in Ukraine!"}, {"url": "http://www.dampress.net/?page=show_det&category_id=102&id=97958", "title": "The mystery of the 5-year-old coronavirus! ..

Every dead man died from the killer germ as long as his passing still raised questions.\nJournalists vie with each other for the scariest snapshot, the most heartbreaking corona tragedy, the most alarming expert statement. As a matter of course, they are helping to suppress dissenting opinions. No wonder why neither resident doctors nor the pneumological and intensive care units in our hospitals continue to report any worrying increase in serious respiratory diseases. Nobody wonders why death rates everywhere in Europe, even in Italy and Spain, are not soaring rapidly, but are even below the level of previous years. Hardly anyone listens to the well-founded, factual concerns of many doctors and scientists that the corona hype alienates, even horrifies - and when it does, apparently there is a lack of courage to hang what is heard on the big bell.\nMissing questions\nNo one is wondering why free citizens, just because they belong to a so-called risk group, have to let go of the insane - as if they couldn't take care of themselves. Life is always life-threatening, especially in the evening. What health risks grandpa wants to accept or avoid: shouldn't that be left to him, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, lack of exercise and inferior nutrition? Nobody seems to notice that the supposed solution is already far worse than the problem. Nobody wants to know why calls for increased hygiene, special caution and consideration would not have been the same as before 2020.\nNobody researches who actually put all the apocalyptic information and situation analyzes on the bloody medical layperson at the cabinet table of the federal government, which make an emergency actionism seem like no alternative; with how many and which lobbyists they talked about before and during the crisis. Hardly anyone dares to put the shyest question mark behind any infection control measure.\nNobody is concerned about whether it could be of any use to the fact that the crisis caused the greatest possible panic and dragged on. None of them has the uneasy feeling that he is currently being instrumentalized - as a sidekick in a thriller whose story unfolds with the precision of a clockwork, based on a script that may have been written before Wuhan. And and and\nIn short, the so-called fourth violence is no less infected with panic viruses than the state power, which should actually accompany it at a critical distance. Instead, it comes about as weak as an advanced muscular dystrophy patient.\n- You criticize that \"horror numbers\" are spread. Others think that is just the facts. What do you base your criticism on?\nSorry, but confusing the official case numbers with hard facts shows a level of education and IQ that is cause for concern. How can a mentally disabled adult, and especially a journalist, seriously fail to recognize that you can die from a virus, but not necessarily because of it? Is it water that will eventually kill us all because 100 percent of all H2O tests on the deceased would be positive? The official infection and death rates alone are clinically meaningless. Anyone who passes them on to their readers or viewers undigested, knowing which primal fears they are helping to stir up, should be banned as soon as possible. It violates basic rules of journalistic ethics.\n- Why are there no criticisms of the \"pillared saints\" like the Robert Koch Institute or the virologist Christian Drosten who set the tone in the corona crisis, as you find out?\nBecause they represent \"the\" science - or what journalists think. But real science knows no authorities to whom one must bow in awe, like the Catholic before the Holy Father. It knows no untouchable truths, only preliminary hypotheses. It never excludes critics, it does not ignore or suppress undesirable data. Because it lives from open discourse.\nIgnored knowledge\n- They compare, like others, the situation in the announced corona pandemic with that of the annual flu waves. Why, how can that be compared?\nHow can you avoid this comparison? How can a journalist be surprised why suddenly things have to be done differently than in previous flu shafts that came and went reliably, causing millions of people to be infected and tens of thousands killed every year without a rooster crowing. How can a journalist ignore medical observations and scientific studies that have long agreed that SARS-CoV-2 is not more contagious, pathogenic and deadly than influenza and herpes viruses - that 50 to 80 percent of all infected remain completely symptom-free, up to 45 percent have only mild, cold-like symptoms? And that the number of those who die with a detected Covid-19 remains in the tenths of a percent range?\n- In your opinion, why is the solution used by politics \"far worse than the problem\"?\nIsn't that obvious long ago? What incompetent, expert-hearing, hyperactive governments worldwide do with disproportionate epidemic protection transforms entire countries in detention centers, free democracies into fascist hygienic dictatorships. It robs us of the most basic human rights, poisons the intellectual climate, stifles all public life, conjures up an unprecedented economic and financial crisis, destroys an insane number of jobs, and ruins professional livelihoods. Last but not least, it disguises and torments those risk groups that it is supposed to protect.\nConcealed interests\n- What are the interests behind what is currently happening?\nBecause they are not obvious, anyone who dares to think about it must be ridiculed as a conspiracy theorist. One thing is clear: this corona avalanche only started when the WHO declared a pandemic. It did so because of an enigmatic redefinition of the term - before 2009, it referred to a novel pathogen that causes serious disease worldwide and dramatically increases death rates. On the other hand, since 2009, mere distribution has been sufficient, regardless of the extent of the danger to life and limb. When looking for the real background to the corona crisis, a journalist with an intact cerebral cortex should first ask:\nWho was behind the redefinition? Which experts prompted the WHO to do this and what conflicts of interest did they have? It has long depended on the drip of the pharmaceutical industry, 85 percent of which is financed by grants from Big Pharma and pharma-related foundations, especially the Gates Foundation.\nAs journalists should have learned from the unspeakable \"swine flu\" scandal, an industry can make billions if it manages to stir up primal human fears. Every pandemic opens up a terrific business field: for tests, for medication, for vaccines.\nEvery now and then journalists uncover one or the other bribery scandal. Apparently, however, almost everyone lacks an eye for the big picture. Healthcare worldwide is chronically ill - pandemically contaminated with profit interests. An outrageous market has degenerated in which the medical industry, because of its insane financial resources, has an almost limitless power to comprehensively deceive consumers about the advantages and dangers of its products, to discredit undesirable competitors and to prevent regulation Bypassing laws, avoiding effective controls, poisoning all sources of information, harnessing the opinion leaders of conventional medicine as hagglers, freezing critics, making all important players compliant, even putting organizations like the WHO on a leash - for a single purpose: to Maximize profits.\nHuge profits\nThe pharmaceutical industry alone now has an annual turnover of 1.1 trillion euros, with fabulous profit margins of 30 percent and more. A maximum of 10 to 15 percent of this goes into research and development, but at least 40 percent goes into marketing - this corresponds to several hundred billion euros a year. And marketing is much more than traditional advertising - it includes all measures that promote sales, if necessary also through lobbying, corruption, reputation murder and covert propaganda.\nOur health care system, it must be said so clearly, has largely degenerated into a ball of organized crime - a smoothly running supply machine that has by far the most profitable economic sector on the planet, also to the horror of some doctors, has long been mafia-like. He will continue to do so worldwide. Because globalization unleashes capitalism as long as political control doesn't keep pace with it.\nIt would be all the more important that investigative journalism would be fearless and independent, mentally and financially. But how could he do that when he himself has long since become part of the problem? No, \"lying press\" is a common dirty word, because hardly any journalist intentionally spreads falsehoods. But “system press” hits the nail on the head.\nMissing research\n- In your opinion, what are the causes of most journalists' behavior? Is the problem of a lack of scientific knowledge in newsrooms or ignorance of scientific views that either do not fit into a specific intended “message” for an article, report, etc. or are simply not intelligently understood?\nSensationalism, pressure from above, an uncritical way of thinking: all of this plays a role. Ultimately, today's journalists, from TV news presenters to political magazine makers to local editors, fail, but primarily because they are intellectual children of an age in which scientism has replaced Christianity as the state religion. As it turns out not only in the Corona crisis, today's journalists' most thorough research ends at the latest with the statement of Professor X, Chief Virologist Y, Institute Director Z. Most of them fall to their knees before the Holy Cow Science.\n- Science, especially university, is today also a competition for research funding or laboratory equipment. How can journalists recognize relatively quickly whether an expert is really independent or, for example, wants to pay \"open bills\" with colleagues or government agencies?\nThey would often find what they were looking for by entering the names of those concerned in the search field on Google, along with keywords such as “conflicts of interest”. If they searched the Internet to find out which people, companies, and industries appear on the list of sponsors and advisory boards for those employers.\nIf you realized that scientists also have a human psyche, even people like that are not free from prejudice and rulership, from envy, vanity, addiction to addiction and burning ambition. They are also corruptible. They just hide it more successfully.\nDr. Harald Wiesendanger (born 1956) is a studied philosopher, psychologist and sociologist. He has published over 50 books since the late 1980s, mainly on psychological and medical topics, in addition to more than 3,000 articles in newspapers, magazines and Internet portals. After being active in the healer scene for a long time, he turned away from it a few years ago and denounced its excesses, warned those seeking help against alleged “miracles”, against excessive promises, against “wannabe people with cloudy esotericism” try to make up for dubious titles and diplomas, which lack their therapeutic ability ”.\nHe is a member of the board of the “Ausweg” foundation, which he seeks to find therapeutic solutions for chronically ill children and adults.\nHis most recent book \"Das Gesundheitsunwesen\" deals with the medical industry and criticizes it as a \"global profit machine\"."}, {"url": "https://arabic.rt.com/press/1097295-%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D9%87%D8%A8%D8%AA-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7/", "title": "Why Russia came to the aid of Italy?", "text": "Why Russia came to the aid of Italy?\nPress news\nUnder the above title, Artem Kapchuk writes about Russia's assistance to Italy in tackling the Coronavirus.\nAnother huge Russian plane, the fourteenth plane of the Russian military transport plane, landed at the \"Praktika-Di-Marie\" airport at the Italian air base located 30 kilometers southwest of the Italian capital, Rome.\nThe plane carried more Russian military experts and equipment designed to deal with epidemics and outbreaks of viruses, detection and sterilization. Most importantly, the process of transferring additional Russian personnel and equipment to Italy will continue.\nAfter completing consultations with the Italian military, Russian military experts will begin implementing prevention and sterilization operations in areas most affected by the Coruna virus outbreak in Italy, according to a statement of the Russian Ministry of Defense.\nIt is clear that we are facing an unprecedented rescue operation by Russia to ward off an unprecedented pandemic that hit one of the world's most developed and developed countries, which raises the question of the reasons that allowed the newly created coronary killer to be singular in Italy, after he loosened his iron fist from the necks of the Chinese.\nThe amount of urgent Russian assistance to the Italian Republic is truly unparalleled, especially since the delivery of this assistance required the use of the powerful Ilyushin-76 transport planes, which are among the largest transport planes in the world. It is noteworthy that the first ten planes, which formed the vanguard regiment of the group of \"biological\" military experts, were prepared to take off in their entirety human and equipment from the Russian military bases in the suburbs of Moscow to the Italian \"Praktika-Di-Marie\" base within a few hours!\nGiven the size of the payload, is it an exaggeration to say that a military and technical force with this population, and with this unique specialization, can be considered, in military concepts, that they were pushed to the front, as if to face the repercussions of using a biological weapon really?\nWe called from the conspiracies and their endless chapters, especially that Cuba, too, sent a group of its doctors to help their Italian colleagues, to ask at the beginning, why did not other Western countries, collectively, like the European Union, or scattered, come to the rescue of its Italian neighbor, even if it was self-protecting, especially since the virus had had He removed the borders between the countries of the world in two months or less?\nWe postpone the answer to this question a little bit to get to know first the nature of the forces sent by Russia and the type of operations that they will carry out in Italy. And what did the Russian experts bring with them of equipment and technologies to the European focus of the outbreak of corona?\nExperts really know the secrets of the conflict with the epidemic and bacteriological weapons.\nRussian military expert Viktor Murakhovsky, a reserve colonel in the army, editor-in-chief of the \"Arsenal Autocestva\" magazine (\"Arsenal of the Nation\"), a member of the Council of Experts of the Russian Military and Industrial Committee, said in his interview with the \"Russian Dimensions\" program that they are \"radiation, chemical and biological protection forces, And the Department of Military Medicine of the Russian Armed Forces ... We have special units, both in the medical service and in the formation of the radiological, chemical and biological protection forces, designed to combat bacteriological weapons, as a component of weapons of mass destruction. \"\nThe \"Ilyushin-76\" Russian military transport aircraft carried mobile laboratories that allow the identification of the nature of the viral and bacteriological threat.\nColonel Viktor Morakhovsky explains that \"it also allows for medical reconnaissance, identification of foci and sources of pollution, and determination of methods of treatment. It has also sent mechanisms from the radiological, chemical and biological protection forces dedicated to carrying out disinfection.\"\nAs for the type of operations in which the Russian military contributes, Morakhovsky says that it is \"above all measures to disinfect foci that are potentially contaminated biologically ... Radiation, chemical and biological protection forces have special high-efficiency equipment that allows the disinfection of equipment, people, buildings, installations, etc.\"\nAlso important is that among the 100 Russian experts who are now in Italy, it may be those who are familiar with vaccines. They, as expected by infection control specialist Sergei Busheuev, in an interview with the Russian \"Life\" channel in Moscow, can put \"a test vaccine\" against the most dangerous defectors in the field directly.\nBushev explained that such research usually begins 36 or 48 hours after the group reaches the target location.\nSo, the task of these people may not only be to provide treatments for the infected and pandemic, but may also include studying the viruses themselves, according to the Russian doctor.\nHere we return to the question of why Italy failed to anticipate Corona in its early stages, forcing it to face the most dangerous wave of viral outbreaks in Europe and the world. What is surprising is that this is happening in the most developed countries in the world, whose medical and health services are among the best in the world.\n\"The source of this virus in Italy was a hotspot no less severe than China. Maybe a boom occurred after its arrival in Italy. All of this must be analyzed later. Italy is distinguished from the countries that suffer from coronavirus infection,\" Colonel Viktor Murakhovsky said. I do not see at the present time a clear explanation based on scientific facts, which can explain what happened in Italy. So far only hypotheses have been raised, and we have to wait a little while the true picture unfolds. \"\nHowever, is the reason for the weakness in the infrastructure and its lack of capacity to accommodate the state of the epidemic, or that research in Italy and the sciences related to viruses and infection and methods of containing them were not developed enough in general, and conducting so-called epidemiological investigations in particular?\nMost likely, the main reason is the specificity of the emerging situation in general, and the extent of the outbreak of one of the fastest-spreading viruses the world has seen in the last ten or twenty years?\nAs for armies, especially in the major countries, they usually have special scientific and field capabilities. Including the stomach to face chemical, biological or bacterial risks. In many other countries, however, due to the outbreak of Corona, the national armed forces are often used, including, for example, to support quarantine measures. Are the armies of NATO member states lacking these capabilities, I wonder?\n\"The structures concerned with combating the consequences of the use of weapons of mass destruction in the Cold War era, including bacteriological weapons, were developed sufficiently in the armies of NATO members. But, after the end of the Cold War, they were practically nullified, and military medicine was greatly reduced,\" expert Murakhovsky said. \".\nAs for the situation of the Russian army after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was in a deplorable state.\nHere, the Russian expert explains that these areas were also endangered in our country during the 1990s, especially the radiation, chemical and biological protection forces and the Department of Military Medicine in the Russian armed forces, but we, and this is important, we rushed to rebuild these structures after 2012, and it turned out that this was useful \".\nAs for NATO forces, perhaps this potential remained to some extent. However, it is clear that a distress call to the Italian military alliance, and their countries are under the blows of the biological killer, has not been heard.\nReturning to Russia, her stance toward stricken Italy was met with some surprise.\nIt is normal. Viktor Murakhovsky reminds that Italy is a member of NATO and the European Union, and participates in the sanctions imposed by the European Union at the request of the United States on Russia. \"In Sicily an air base from which US drones daily take off to the Russian border with the intention of spying.\"\nAnd do not forget, and the conversation continues for expert Murakhovsky, “The presence of the US Airborne Brigade and the Aviation Group and the headquarters of the Sixth Fleet of the United States in Italy. In response to all these“ wonderful ”things from Italy we decided to help it fight the Corona virus. Therefore, when Italians who do not Still young, especially their young government, in their future, these criteria must be taken into account, that is, what is being imposed and what is really happening. ”\nOn the other hand, Italy is a friendly country of Russia with which it has long-standing friendship. Also, economic ties and contacts between businessmen in both countries remained close despite the sanctions.\nThe Praktika-Di-Marie base of the Italian Air Force also has a special symbolism, as it is the base that hosted the first meetings of the “Russia-NATO” Council after its establishment in 2002 with an Italian initiative in an attempt by Russia and NATO to normalize their relations.\nFinally, we can summarize the main reasons - in an instant motion - for Russia's swift move to help Italy with the following:\nFirst, the virus did not spread in Russia compared to the extent of its outbreak in the Italian peninsula, and this is an opportunity to study the Italian version of Corona, especially after the virus mutated, developed and became more dangerous.\nSecond, the use of special military \"protocols\" that may be more effective than their \"civilian\" counterparts in monitoring and responding to the complications of the pandemic, and definitely, to save more lives, so that the number of deaths in Italy alone due to COVID-19 has reached more than 6800 deaths, And if there are differences between methods of calculating deaths.\nThird, Russia has special forces dedicated to countering nuclear, chemical and biological / bacteriological weapons.\nFourth, prevent the arrival of the most dangerous Italian version of the Corona virus or reduce its leakage to Russia and other countries by checking information on the ages of the infected people, the conditions of their infection, death and recovery in Italy.\nFifth, most of the infected who transmitted the infection to others in Russia had come from Italy.\nSixth, the task of the Russian force in Italy will help us approach the moment of obtaining an effective vaccine against the deadly Corona virus.\nAnother strong impulse is, of course, a humanist. Russia has always been rushing to help other countries cope with various emergency situations such as natural disasters, such as devastating earthquakes, floods, fires, hurricanes and other hardships. Now it is the turn of the virus to be a tool that tests us ... destiny and destiny.\nArtium Capchuk\nThe article only expresses the opinion of the newspaper or the writer\nItalian praise of Field Marshal Hifter\n62 refugees send a distress call from the sea\nMbappe chooses the best goal he has seen in stadiums (video)\nAn Italian oil federation: Haftar is a \"good axis for the oil and gas sector\" in Libya"}, {"url": "https://tsargrad.tv/news/koronavirus-pozhiraet-ssha-rossija-shlet-pomoshh-samoletom_245510", "title": "Coronavirus devours USA, Russia sends help by plane", "text": "Coronavirus devours USA, Russia sends help by plane\nRussia announced its readiness to send a plane to the United States with the help to fight against coronavirus.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also spoke on the phone about the coronavirus epidemic.\nRussian aid to Italy\nLast week, Russia sent 11 aircraft to Italy with medical equipment, medicines and Russian military virologists to help the country overcome the coronavirus epidemic.\nAfter arriving in Italy, Russian specialists were sent to Lombardy, where the situation with the virus is especially difficult. There, Russian virologists, together with Italian military experts, carried out a complete sanitary disinfection of three boarding houses for the elderly in the cities of Clusone, Cheney and Vertol.\nWe believe that there is no better word than THANKS to express our gratitude.

You left your country and your families to be with us, and we are deeply touched by this, ”said a letter from the vice mayor of the city of Chen, Marcela Badzana, addressed to Russian military virologists.\nReaction of Europe\nWhile Italy thanks Russia for the help, the European media \"spit poison.\" A number of publications have published articles criticizing Russian aid. Especially distinguished newspaper La Stampa.

The coronavirus factor worked as a catalyst that activated the imagination of citizens and generated rapidly spreading fear. This was especially facilitated by the fact that, unexpectedly, America became the leader in the spread of viral infection. March 27, the United States came first in the world in the number of cases of coronavirus.\nIn terms of the number of deaths from the disease, the United States is still slightly behind Italy and Spain, ranking third. The United States has the highest growth rate in the number of infected and dead. As of April 2, more than 215 thousand people were registered with the disease, more than 5 thousand died. Now about 80% of Americans are obliged to stay at home, life in the largest American cities is paralyzed, and New York remains the center of the epidemic.\nUS President Donald Trump reassures the population that America conducts mass testing of the population (unlike most other countries), and the more tests, the more infected are detected. However, this is not very reassuring. Moreover, Trump agrees with intimidating forecasts, such as the fact that coronavirus can take in America from 100 to 200 thousand human lives. There are also numbers that can intimidate even more. By order of MTI, experts simulated the spread of coronavirus in the United States in the coming months and said that by the end of 2020, an outbreak of coronavirus could affect from 160 to 214 million people, and in case of development of the “worst-case scenario” from COVID-19 in America, they could die before 2.2 million people.\nTo this are added gloomy economic forecasts. On April 2, Bank of America analysts revised their estimates of the dynamics of US GDP in 2020. The new estimate provides a 6 percent reduction in GDP. And finance minister Stephen Mnuchin said recently that unemployment in America could rise to 20% by the middle of the year.\nThe American auto industry stopped. Shale oil production is paralyzed. In the shops there is a stir, food products and toilet paper are swept from the shelves. A little more, and the picture that was observed in New Orleans in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina destroyed the city, and the survivors began to smash the shops and clean the apartments of the victims, could be repeated.\nAnd now, the media is fueling an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty in the country. Psychiatrists note a \"spring exacerbation\" in their patients (the increase in patients with mental disorders in America exceeds the increase in those infected with coronavirus).\nIn the US, there is a prevailing clip of soothsayers, futurologists, astrologers, which journalists now remind. Some of them predicted that America would die in a great flood. This, for example, Dr. Lindsay, who in the late 1940s \"prophesied\" that the United States would die from the flood, there will be only a small archipelago of islands between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Everyone in America knows the \"sleeping prophet\" Edgar Cayce. He also predicted that New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, as well as Georgia, Carolina and many other states would go under water. Terrible scenarios for America were drawn by such \"visionaries\" as Thomas Descartes, Dannion Brickley, Valdes Jr., a bunch of different psychics.\nAn additional fear on the Americans is inspired by the horror films again in demand today, depicting pictures of the collapse of America. For example, 2012 is a disaster film directed by Roland Emmerich, released in 2009. Here is also a picture of the complete flooding of America by the ocean. Interest in the film after the end of 2012 weakened, but in 2020, the growth in viewing the picture began again. Fortunately, with quarantine, residents of the United States now have a lot of free time.\nSome time ago, Americans were nervous about the volcano in Yellowstone National Park (the park is located in Wyoming, partly in the states of Montana and Idaho). In the area of the park, increased seismic activity is observed, the volcano itself is muffled. For some time, many lived in the anxious expectation that the \"last day of Pompeii\" was about to begin in the country, but the daily bustle gradually distracted from observing the supervolcano.\nAnd now the Americans again have an interest in volcanic activity. It turns out that over the past few months, more than 200 earthquakes have been recorded. They write that if a volcano erupts in Yellowstone, territory with a radius of several hundred kilometers will be flooded with magma, and all living things will die within a radius of tens of thousands of kilometers. Gaseous emissions will lead to an impenetrable night settling over the territory of the USA, and on the whole planet due to severe atmospheric pollution (billions tons of ash) there will be a noticeable decrease in temperature (four year nuclear winter effect). The supervolcano will destroy not only America, but also the states that are in contact with the oceans; a huge tsunami will cover England and Holland, and China will suffer greatly. And they say, Russia will turn out to be one of the safest places in the event of a supervolcano eruption ...\nIn addition to the apocalyptic scenarios of the death of America (scripts, admittedly, cheap), more thorough versions of the end of the \"shining city on the hill\" are also discussed. For example, the collapse of the United States. The famous American political scientist Professor Stephen Cohen has repeatedly expressed the opinion that the preconditions for the collapse of the United States have been building up for decades.\nAnd here is the opinion of the famous American journalist Paul Starobin, which he outlined in the book \"After America: Tales of the Coming Global Age.\" Starobin believes that there has long been an unacceptable interference by the central government in state affairs. It is necessary, in his opinion, to restore the confederal structure, as it was during the creation of the United States. Starobin proposes to consider the option of ridding the United States of \"high-ranking autocracy from Washington\" and turning America into a collection of autonomous regional republics that reflect the economic and cultural characteristics of the regions. In his opinion, this will mean a return to the \"creative sources\" favorable for the United States.\nDiplomat and historian George Kennan predicted the collapse of the United States following the collapse of the USSR. In a 1993 book, Around the Rocky Hill: Personal and Political Philosophy, he wrote that the United States has become a “monster country” that suffers from swollen bureaucracy and “unjustified pride”. In his opinion, life would have been much better arranged if the United States \"were decentralized into something like a dozen constituent republics.\"\nIsolationism, an exciting world with coronavirus, is observed not only at the level of individual states, but also at the regional level. The individual states that make up the US state today are starting to isolate themselves from their neighbors and act differently than Washington would like. The Coronavirus Factor activates separatism in America. Texas separatists became especially lively.\nSo not only astrologers and psychics prophesy the bleak future of America; political scientists and sociologists say the same thing, but everyone has forecasts with an “open date” - they refrain from predicting when the end will come. However, there is one forecast in which the date is specified specifically - 2020. The person who named this date is our contemporary. We will talk about him and his forecast for 2020 in the next article.\nФото: REUTERS / Marco Bello"}, {"url": "https://hathalyoum.net/articles/2292576-%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%8A-%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85-5-", "title": "Coronary virus puzzle that slept 5 years!", "text": "Coronary virus puzzle that slept 5 years!\nThis controversy escalated, especially between the United States and China, to the highest levels, as US President Donald Trump described it as a Chinese virus, while Beijing suspected it to be from the United States.

Fire on \"conspiracy theory\" oil. This report R was published on November 12, 2015, and stated that American scientists have created in the laboratory a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats in connection with a virus that causes SARS, that is, acute respiratory syndrome. The magazine showed about 5 years ago that scientists examined a virus called \"SHC014\", It was found in the horseshoe bats of China. These scientists combined the surface protein of \"SHC014\" with the SARS virus, and came out with a new virus that provided the surface protein with a structure that helps it penetrate into the cells of the human respiratory system. It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but does not kill it. . In this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells.\nThis happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans. Researchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than He previously believed. ”Conversely, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify“ potential risks. ”The virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, Simon Wayne Hobson, commented on the scientists’ innovation of a new, well-growing virus.

The inhabitants of our country need confidence in tomorrow and concrete direct measures of assistance, said the founder of the Tsargrad television channel, Konstantin Malofeev.\nIn the context of the mass transition of the Russian population to a regime of self-isolation, and the economy in a state of prostration and shock, it is extremely important for our country to prevent a situation in which people are left to their own devices. Consolidated government support measures are estimated at 1 trillion 300 billion rubles. They include tax holidays, and holidays that are provided through banks, and other types of support.\nAfter the government announced the first measures to help citizens, the economy and business, it became obvious that they were insufficient. The first step should be followed by the second, which includes direct assistance to companies and enterprises so that they can pay people salaries.\nOn the air of Tsargrad, the founder of the TV channel Konstantin Malofeev assessed the sufficiency of the current measures and the prospects for their expansion, and also commented on the latest reports of the Russian headquarters to combat coronavirus, providing for the introduction of a mechanism of severe restrictions without introducing an emergency mode.\nEconomic support\nKonstantin Malofeev noted that when compared with support measures in other countries, Russia should rather go along the path of China, which “buys out” value-added production, and not along the path of European countries that try to help their economies, but do nothing for citizens .\n\"For example, in China, the government is committed to redeeming everything that enterprises produce during the epidemic. Can you imagine what economic measure is significant? In addition, tax incentives will be increased to stimulate social donations. Donations from enterprises and individuals will be fully deductible before paying income tax.\" - he said.\nAt the same time, Russia should by no means be guided by Europe, which is drowning without effective measures to support citizens and is trying to stabilize the economy with small injections against the backdrop of the raging COVID-19 epidemic.\nEurope does nothing. A task force was created, which included five EU commissioners. An increase in the program for buying up assets in the market by 120 billion euros. How does it help people sick? That is, it is clearly visible that there was a complete failure of the EU project. The European Union is not capable of fighting anything. We forgot about him. We say: news from Italy, news from Spain, from Germany. We are not saying: news from Europe. Because Europe was totally unprepared. No need for the European Union for the population of Europe,\n- said Malofeev.\nIn Russia, a completely different project is needed to support citizens and the economy. An additional and logical package of new measures is needed, he said. And first of all, it is necessary to remove benefactors from the tax blow, as is done in China.\nIn extreme circumstances, charity should be excluded from the tax base. A food fund close to me, Rus, which helps the poor and destitute, receives food from donors and then delivers it free of charge throughout the country. Fund Director Yulia Nazarova turned to Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin a week ago with a request to deduct from the VAT and income tax, attention, products that the manufacturer gives to charity donate to the poor,\n- said Malofeev.\nThe philanthropist, he continued, does not receive any profit from the free distribution of food, which means that the tax is levied on him for some reason. According to Malofeev, Russia destroys 17 million tons of food, while in order to feed all 18 million needy people, only 1.2 million tons are needed, that is, ten times less than what is destroyed.\n\"And this is impossible for us, because the food sector enterprises are going to go bankrupt. Thank God, now, in an emergency, measures are being taken. And if the government, the past government of Medvedev, refused to exclude it from the tax base, now, we see it, the movement begins, \"he said.\nThe current measures to help the Russian economy from the government as a whole are a step in the right direction. However, others should follow. Now direct support measures should be announced, Malofeev said.\nWe supported what the president announced, and immediately indicated that this is the first step. And we talked about the fact that within two weeks, a maximum of three, the second step should come. Week later. Further, we must understand that we are in an extremely force majeure situation. And, accordingly, it can only be supported by revolutionary measures. No past simple measures will help,\n- he noted.\nTargeted Assistance and Nationalization\nThe founder of Constantinople emphasized that the country was faced with a radical situation, and now targeted assistance to people, specific subsidies are needed, as citizens continue to stay at home and cannot earn a living. In addition, employers must be directly supported, otherwise it should be announced that a project called \"market economy\" is being curtailed in the country and Russia is moving to a mobilization economy.\n\"Then, accordingly, publish the relevant laws on how, on what basis and why you will compensate today's business for their employers, and take them away. And then you support the employees, not them. Now we are not talking about either capitalization or \"It’s possible that people are just starting to understand, but in two weeks everyone will understand it. Now we remembered that the economy is not Adam Smith’s Economics or the Friedman’s cave monetarism, according to which our Central Bank and the Higher School of Economics live,\" Malofeev.\nIn this case, monetarists should be replaced by people who understand how to manage a mobilization economy, because Russia is already \"rolling into it,\" he said. And the first task is to save jobs. And the possible nationalization of enterprises.\nThe country is faced with a radical situation, and now it needs targeted assistance to people, specific subsidies, as citizens continue to stay at home and cannot earn a living. Photo: Alexander Avilov / AGN \"Moscow\"\n“If they do not continue to support the existing private business, then in two or three weeks with this approach of Sberbank, all this private business will be in Sberbank and VTB. And these are state-owned banks. It will be nationalized anyway, just a silent glitch, without an announcement. he’ll hang out inside these state-owned banks. Now will state-owned banks steer the whole economy? People who consider credit risks will now steer the industries? This is not normal, \"Malofeev emphasized.\nPrivate business, of course, will be against it. But in this case, the authorities also need to declare open nationalization, which will also be one of the approaches, he noted. Or measures must be announced that will allow private business to stay afloat and feed their employees and their families. Therefore, measures should not concern only small and medium-sized businesses, which are focused on the attention of the government, but should include support for large enterprises where thousands of people work, I am sure Malofeev.\n\"Digital concentration camp\"\nThe founder of Constantinople also commented on the authorities' measures to introduce strict self-isolation of citizens and a system of control over their movement. According to Malofeev, the state of emergency should be introduced in the country, which will immediately transfer all institutions and departments to a special mode of operation and help the state and citizens to resist the spread of infection. Now in Russia there is only a high alert mode.\n\"We are obliged to mobilize the economy, to introduce a state of emergency. Because what the operational headquarters headed by Sobyanin is now undertaking, this already contradicts Article 55 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation. Our constitutional rights and freedoms are already limited,\" said Malofeev .\nAccording to him, for taking special measures in the country there is all the necessary regulatory framework, you just need to launch the appropriate mechanism to protect the country and citizens.\n\"Now everyone has been forbidden to go out. They have restricted constitutional freedom of movement. This, according to Article 55, is possible only by law. There is no law. A subject of the Federation has no right to such actions, even if it is a question of Moscow. But there must be a law. This doesn’t mean that we won’t sit at home. We’re sitting now, because we are responsible citizens and nobody wants to infect each other, \"Malofeev said.\nThe current interim regime, he stressed, is beneficial only to banks. Whereas the emergency regime would mobilize enterprises for the production of protective masks, and the operational headquarters simply abolishes 144-ФЗ on public procurements, because \"it is necessary to save\", although the emergency regime would solve all the problems.\nI offer bankers who have a car, and this is the majority, to work as volunteers. And deliver food to the grandmothers who are sitting at home. Now the All-Russian public organization \"Two-headed Orel\" and \"United Popular Front\" provide a lot of opportunities to help the disadvantaged, ”said Malofeev.\nA separate problem is the initiative to introduce QR codes to control the self-isolation of citizens. The founder of Constantinople noted not only that such measures violate legal rights, but also generally turn a person into a set of numbers.\n\"And now, without declaring war, without declaring an emergency, someone says: now you will not be called Malofeev Konstantin Valerievich, Malofeev - my family name belongs to my family for 500 years, Valeryevich is my father, and Konstantin is my heavenly patron. They say to me: now you will be “number.” I may have read Nikolai Serbsky and do not want to move God's word from civilization to the Kabbalistic civilization of numbers, ”he said.\nMost citizens are rational people who sit at home because they are aware of the situation and the threat. Photo: Kirill Zykov / AGN \"Moscow\nMalofeev noted that legally it looks generally like a seizure of power by the subject of Moscow, as it introduces these norms, and then they are distributed to other regions. Decisions are made by two headquarters - under the State Council and the government.\n\"An emergency - it’s an emergency. And what kind of emergency is it? Are we usually home-staying? Are we afraid to leave? Of course, it’s now emergency. So introduce this regime and we will all understand it under the law, which clearly defines the rights and obligations and who is responsible for the regime. We now have an operational headquarters under the State Council, headed by Sergei Semenovich Sobyanin, and there is a government of the Russian Federation, which also has its own headquarters, which is headed by Mishustin, \"said Malofeev.\nAt the same time, according to him, the majority of citizens are rational people and they go home because they are aware of the situation and the threat. But at the same time, it remains unclear why the special regime is not introduced by law. As a result, the inhabitants of Russia are held hostage by the anti-utopian \"electronic concentration camp\", where there are no names and surnames, but only numbers, and a special emergency regime along with all relevant laws does not apply.\nSerious self-isolation: The first day of Novosibirsk under the new rules\nNow free: List of what has fallen in price and become a gift because of coronavirus\nWhy you can hate the Russian oligarchs.

Mr. Aslanyan is convinced that the coronavirus is, first of all, a test of the weapon to control people through fear.\n\"We have to learn to live in a state of panic, because if there is no coronavirus, there will be Ebola or another infection or phenomenon that will keep people in a constant state of panic, because it is not easy to control people without panic.\"\nAccording to him, in 2002-2003 another species of coronavirus broke out in China, which killed 813 people and spread the virus to the world economy, costing 40 billion dollars. Oil prices fell by 35% and securities by 15%.\nDetails in the video\nAccording to David Aslanyan, the number of deaths does not say anything, because no one has statistics. \"We don't know who those people are, what diseases they have. Coronavirus behaves strangely, choosing countries that are trying to collapse. For example, China, Iran. Why in Italy, too? Because there is a pope there, whose sneezing can cause great panic. ”\nAccording to Mr. Aslanyan, the next stage of the crisis of the world economy is knocking on our door. \"I consider living in Armenia a strong competitive advantage, because the less serious the economy, the lighter the consequences of collapse. The bigger the economy, the more painful it is to collapse. ” David Aslanyan thinks that the spread of this virus is a task to slow down the growth of the world economy and freeze the world economy. \"Freezing the world economy through China is more efficient,\" Mr Aslanyan said, noting that there are no world wars now, there are hybrid wars, and \"the coronavirus is an example of a hybrid war.\"\nAccording to the analyst, the value side of the phenomenon is that the goal is to deprive societies of their human face, but he hopes that the Armenian mentality will not allow each other to help each other, reach out and unite in other situations.\nLusine BUDARYAN"}, {"url": "https://www.salam-tv.net/ar/news/142038.html", "title": "Study: \"Corona\" is not considered fatal to all humans

imposes a number of questions about the truth of their scientific roots, in the first place, and the political and strategic dimensions of all mankind from the directions of countries producing biological weapons arsenals, led by the United States.\nOn these days in January 2012, an international conference convened by the United Nations in Geneva to develop mechanisms for controlling biological weapons failed, in which the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, made a speech \"encouraging the ongoing efforts to protect humanity from the specter of biological weapons.\" Strongly rejected the establishment of international restrictions to verify the safety of the world.\nRead also: Corona Virus outbreaks violate husbands' secrets\nJohn Bolton preceded him in his official position as Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, 2001, by rejecting the investigation system that the United Nations reached after painstaking years of negotiations, in whole and in detail, saying, \"... the United States will simply not enter into agreements that would allow Rogue states or others develop and deploy biological weapons. \"\nThree countries are internationally \"trusted\" to implement the Biological Weapons Convention concluded in 1975 with the signature of 165 countries: Russia, Britain and the United States; to receive complaints and suggest solutions.\nAmong the scientific complaints received by the “Big Three,” December 9, 2001, was a briefing by the American human rights organization Ithaca to the Seventh International Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention: its content was that the United States violated the treaty due to its active involvement in developing an offensive biological weapons program They are stored in \"Sierra Army Depots,\" in northern California and \"possibly in other regions.\"\nIt is noteworthy that the then US administration introduced \"Article 817\" to the articles of the Patriot Act, 2001, whereby the government would allow the development and storage of biological weapons and their release systems without restrictions, that is, a practical abolition of the texts of the international agreement signed on it.\nWhat is striking and disturbing is what was predicted by the then Deputy Minister of Internal Security, Daniel Gerstein, addressing the aforementioned international conference, 2012, that his country \"expects an epidemic to spread at the end of 2013.\" \"Diagnosis\" was shared by Dr. Joseph Kim at the Enuvio Vaccine Production Company.\nThe official American prediction of a pandemic before it occurred raised a range of questions and speculation about the dangerous extent of the biological weapons program and its threat to the lives and welfare of large numbers of people.\nHollywood was accompanied by the production of a movie called Contagion in 2011, which revolves around a pandemic caused by bats, according to the prepared scenario, which is currently taking place with the Corona pandemic in China, which is likely to be the source of the virus in Wuhan.\nIn the context of the American \"prediction\", China was exposed in 2013 to a huge wave of \"bird flu - H7N9\", which immediately started to exterminate millions of chicken birds and the negative repercussions it left not only on its economy, but at the global level to ban trafficking and dealing with Beijing. Repeat it these days also.\nOn January 31, the US government announced that it had implemented \"new measures to combat the Corona virus, including preventing Chinese citizens from entering\" its territory, and applying quarantine to people coming from there.\n\"Cuba in 1971 was the first country in the Caribbean to announce its exposure to a dengue fever, which is believed to come from Spain.\" That was the summary of a 2009 medical publication from the prestigious US Institutes of Health. Cuba, in turn, accused the US government of spreading the epidemic that infected its livestock from pigs and of having to exterminate half a million heads.\nScientifically, the Corona virus infects the respiratory system of a person, similar to the previous SARS epidemic - acute pneumonia - and the origins of the two strains are from animals transmitted to humans, and then to its human brother; And spread to Saudi Arabia in 2012, causing severe pneumonia to the patient.\nSome experts in the field of biological sciences suggest that the US government will engage \"in designing a biological attack against China for geopolitical considerations,\" coinciding with the spread of \"a new and dangerous epidemic\" with Chinese New Year celebrations to paralyze Chinese society, the vast majority of whom will use transportation to return to their original villages.\nProfessor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, Richard Eberat, expressed to The Washington Post his doubts about the American source because \"the genome of the virus and its properties do not indicate that it is the kind produced\" in the laboratory.\nThe newspaper and US circles in general have accused China of developing biological weapons at the Wuhan facility \"for engaging in espionage actions to obtain biological components.\"\nEarly this week, he recorded a federal court filing an indictment against Harvard professor Charles Lieber and \"two people of Chinese nationality for trying to smuggle 21 tubes with biological materials into China;\" and Lieber receives a monthly reward of $ 50,000 from Wuhan Technical University, according to the indictment.\nWhat strengthens the hypotheses of the American source of the virus is the Trump administration’s policy to fight China by all means, starting with trade wars, and also subjecting it to a series of “deadly bacterial attacks, viral diseases, and symptoms that target both livestock and humans.”\nEpidemiologist at the Rand Institute, Jennifer Bowie, confirmed the close link between the two epidemics (SARS and Corona) as \"the compatibility ratio between them is at least 70% of genetic material and transmission mechanisms ... the mortality rate for people with SARS is about 10%, compared to 3\" % For Corona virus. \"\nBowie praised the transparency of scientists and the Chinese government, and \"the sharing of international scientific edifices with the genome data of the virus,\" and reached them to find the causes within a short period of time, not exceeding a few days, which will contribute to developing an effective vaccine soon.\nThe American epidemiologist, Dina Grayson, expressed concern about a set of facts surrounding the Corona virus, especially the high speed of its spread from person to person, \"It is not only contagious, but kills the patient ...\" Grayson has long experience in developing drugs to treat the Ebola epidemic.\nIt is worth noting that Corona virus is a US product with distinction, according to the registry of invention submitted in 2015, which was approved in 2018.\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US10130701B2/en?oq=10130701\nIn the same context, there are strange \"separate\" incidents targeting China originating in North America; the most prominent of which was the shipment arrival incident that was issued by Canadian biological laboratories in March 2019, which includes \"malicious viruses,\" the Canadians claimed to be \"part of the research efforts to support public health research in the world.\" . \" It is noteworthy that this shipment was carried out under the veil of secrecy, in contrast to the usual procedures, which prompted the Chinese side to file a formal complaint.\nA large US military delegation, consisting of 300 personnel, arrives in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on October 19, 2019, to participate in a military games festival hosted by China held there. On November 2, 2019, the first infection with the Corona virus was recorded in that province, and it later spread rapidly in December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days.\nThe cost of what China has been exposed to as a result of the epidemic is prohibitive by all measures: disruption of flights and the movement of trains and other transportation at the height of its largest and most important annual feasts; and the stricken Wuhan municipality imposed a ban on leaving the town for its residents “except for urgent reasons; Daily and phenomenal business exchanges with the world.\nIn sum, who can answer the question of the identity of the beneficiary of all this can reach the heart of the matter: waging wars with biological weapons at a lower cost than nuclear engagement.\n* Director of the Center for American and Arab Studies\nAlso read: The Day of the Prisoner ... in the Shadow of the Corona Epidemic\n** All published opinions express the opinion of their authors and do not necessarily express the opinion of \"Dar Al Hayat\""}, {"url": "https://www.geopolitica.ru/en/article/pandemic-and-politics-survival-horizons-new-type-dictatorship", "title": "Pandemic and the Politics of Survival: The Horizons of a New Type of Dictatorship", "text": "Pandemic and the Politics of Survival: The Horizons of a New Type of Dictatorship\nThe breakdown of the global liberal world order and its foundations\nWhat is happening now is a global breakdown of the world order. It does not matter at all whether the nature of the coronavirus is artificial or not, nor is it even of principal importance whether, if it is artificial, it was deliberately released by the “world government” or not. The epidemic has begun - it is a fact. Now the main thing is to trace how the \"world government\" has reacted to it.\nTo clarify, the \"world government\" is the totality of global political and economic elites and the intellectuals and media (mediacrats) that serve them. Such a \"world government\" necessarily exists, because on a global scale there are strictly-defined, fundamental norms that determine the basic parameters of politics, economics and ideology.\n- In the economy, the only recognized norm is capitalism, the market economy (which is disputed only by North Korea - not, and this is very important, by China, which presents its own version of national state capitalism under the management of the Communist Party).\n- In politics the only recognized norm is parliamentary liberal democracy, based on civil society being the subject and source of legality and legitimacy (besides North Korea, almost everyone is in agreement with this, although China interprets \"civil society\" in a special socialist and partly national-cultural optic and carries out mediacratic screening by means other than direct parliamentary elections; and some Islamic states - for example, Iran and the Gulf monarchies - have a number of special features.)\n- In ideology, everyone agrees with the arrangement that any individual has a number of inalienable rights (to life, freedom of conscience, freedom of movement, etc.) which all states and societies are obliged to guarantee.\nIn essence, these are the three basic principles of the global world that emerged after the collapse of the USSR and the victory of the capitalist West in the Cold War. The main players in politics, economics and ideology are concentrated in Western countries, which set the model for others. This is the core of the \"world government\". Inside this government, China is beginning to play an increasingly important role, towards which the elite of Russia and all other states are rushing.\nWhether the coronavirus is artificial is not so important\nIt does not matter whether the coronavirus was produced artificially and deliberately used by the \"world government\" in this sense.\nBut it is this world, under the umbrella of such a \"world government” with all three of its axiomatic foundations, that is collapsing before our very eyes. This is reminiscent of the end of the socialist camp, the bipolar world and the USSR, but then one of two worlds disappeared, while one remained and extended its rules to all others including its yesterday's opponents. Gorbachev himself wanted to get into the \"world government\" without dissolving the USSR, but he was not accepted. Nor were the pro-Western leaders of the Russian Federation who surrendered to the West accepted. They still are not. And now, today, this very \"world government\" is collapsing. Could it have voluntarily opted for liquidation? Hardly. But it reacted to the coronavirus as if to something inevitable, and this was a choice.\nThere was freedom on whether or not to recognize the coronavirus as existing. And by the very fact of its recognition of the pandemic, the \"world government\" signed its own death sentence. Did it do so consciously? No more (or no less) consciously than Gorbachev in Perestroika. In the case of the USSR, one pole disappeared, while the other remained. Today the end of planetary liberal democracy means the end of everything. This system has no other paradigm - except for North Korea (which is still a pure anachronism, albeit a very interesting one) or China’s compromised version.\nWho should have defeated the coronavirus and how?\nThe coronavirus has already struck a blow from which neither politics, economics, nor ideology will recover. The pandemic would have to have been dealt with by the existing institutions, in normal mode without changing the basic rules:\n- neither in politics (meaning no quarantine, no forced isolation, let alone a state of emergency);\n- nor in the economy (no remote work, no stopping of production, exchanges and financial- industrial institutions or trading platforms, no vacation, etc.);\n- nor in ideology (no restrictions, albeit temporary on essential civil rights, freedom of movement, the cancellation or postponement of elections, referenda, etc.).\n...but all of this has already happened on a global scale, including in Western countries, i.e., in the territory of the \"world government\" itself. The very foundations of the global system have been suspended.\nThis is how we see the ongoing situation. For the \"world government\" to take such a step, it had to be forced to do so. By whom? After all, there simply cannot be any higher instance of authority than modern materialistic, atheistic and rationalistic humanity...\nLiberalism as the final result of New Time\nLet us postpone this question for later and now look at the larger historical trajectory of the modern liberal-democratic global system, that is, the government of the \"liberal political elites\" (parliamentarism), major economic players (oligarchs and transnational monopolies), the ideologists of the \"open society\" and the journalists who serve them (including moderators of sentiments on social networks and the Internet). The source of this system should be sought in the end of the Renaissance and in the “New Time” (early Modernity) that emerged therefrom, which saw a fundamental break with the Middle Ages with regard to the subject of power and, consequently, to its very nature. In the Middle Ages and in the society of Tradition overall, the legitimacy and legality of the political model of society were based on the transcendent - superhuman, divine - factor. The supreme subject of power and law was God, His revelations and the laws and settings established by Him, as well as those institutions which were considered to be his representatives on Earth: in the Christian world, these were the Church and the monarchical state. The New Time of Modernity abolished this vertical and set itself the goal of building a society on earthly foundations. Thus the main subject and source of legitimacy and legality became man, and the \"celestial government\" - the \"supra-world government\" - gave way to the \"earthly government\". Politics, economy and ideology changed accordingly: democracy, capitalism and civil society emerged.\nFor several centuries, these principles fought against the old (medieval) order until the last empires - the Russian, Ottoman, Austrian and German - fell in the 20th century. However, liberal democracy still had to cope with such heretical (from the liberal point of view) versions of Modernity as communism and fascism, which in their own ways interpreted \"civil society” and the human being as such: the former in class optics and the latter in national or racial terms. In 1945, the Communists and Liberals jointly ended fascism, and in 1991 the Communists fell. The liberals were the only ones left, and henceforth the \"world government\" turned from a plan into nearly a reality, as all countries and societies have recognized the standards of democracy, the market, and human rights. This is what Francis Fukuyama meant in his book The End of History and the Last Man. The history of this New Time began when the goal was set to replace the celestial subject with the earthly one, and it ended when this replacement was accomplished on a global scale.\nThe end of the liberal world and its parallels with the end of the USSR\nToday, instead of the end of history, that is, instead of the total triumph of liberal democracy, world capitalism and the ideology of the \"open society\" (rights of the human as an individual), we have collapsed into completely new conditions overnight. This is as unexpected as the end of the USSR. Even after 1991, many people could not believe that the Soviet system had disappeared, and some cannot even realize it now. Of course, the end of globalism was sensed by some critical thinkers: it was spoken of by conservatives, and the sharp rise of China, which represents a special model of globalism, Putin's refusal to cede power to the manipulable and controllable (as the West thought) Medvedev in 2012, and perhaps most importantly, Brexit and the rise of populism, could all be considered clear signs that, despite its proximity to the final point, globalism has not only been unable to effectively achieve the “end of history”, but is beginning to paradoxically move away from it. On a philosophical level, the postmodernists began to reflect on this, loudly proclaiming that something was wrong with Modernity.\nBut history has no other way left: it must either move forward along the inertia which it has over the past few centuries, since New Time and the Enlightenment, or collapse. Everyone believed that somehow everything would resolve itself, and that the only thing that mattered was to effectively confront those who were categorized as the \"enemies of open society”, i.e., Putin, Iran, Islamic fundamentalism, or the new rise of nationalist movements rapidly responding to the crisis of mass migration. In general, no one thought of an alternative, even consciously ruling out such. And that is why, in the moment of serious crisis, the global liberal system has failed and collapsed. Almost no-one has understood this yet, but it has already happened. And it has happened irrevocably. Coronavirus, by its very fact and especially by the way in which it has been responded to by the \"world government\", has become the end of the modern world.\nThe end of \"the Ego and Its Own\"\nDoes this mean that humanity will die? This is still unknown, but it cannot be ruled out. One can only guess whether it will perish or not. But what can already be said with certainty is that the global world order based on capitalism, liberal democracy and the principles of the sovereign individual (civil society, the open society) has already perished. It is gone, it has collapsed, although desperate efforts will still be undertaken to save it for some time to come. How they will be deployed and how long they will last is not crucial now. It cannot be ruled out that it will disappear altogether like smoke, just like the Soviet system dissolved in thin air.\nThat which just a second ago was, was fleeting, as if it never was. It is much more important to look at what is coming to replace the old world order.\nThe most important thing to understand is that it is not merely a technical failure in the system of global governance that has happened, but rather the resulting, final element of the entire historical process of Modernity, of New Time, over the course of which power was transferred from the celestial subject to the earthly one, and this subject itself - through the ideological and political battles of the last centuries, including the world hot and cold wars - moved towards a certain crystallization, that of parliamentary democracy, the global capitalist market and the individual endowed with rights. The whole system of modern global capitalism is built on the premise of \"the Ego and its Own\" (Max Stirner). The political rights of the \"Ego\" (the individual in complete isolation from nation, race, religion, sex, etc.) were fixed and entrenched in the global systems of political democracy. Economic rights were embodied in the norms of private property and market mechanisms. Thus, the source of political power reached its imminent limit: in liberalism and globalism, the last hints of verticality and “transcendence\" which had been preserved still at the first stages of Modernity, in particular the structures of the state, were eliminated. Hence the globalist aspiration to abolish the sovereignty of the state and transfer its powers to the supranational level, thus legalizing the \"world government\", which de facto already exists. In other words, the political, economic, and ideological history of New Time moved towards a quite definite end, in which the purely human, immanent, individual subject would be finally formed and laid as the basis for political legitimization. Little was left to chance: the complete abolition of states which took place on the level of the European Union was to be repeated on a global scale.\nThe cancelled finale of liberalism\nThis final moment, to which everything was headed, today is not merely postponed indefinitely, but is altogether cancelled. If political history could not reach this point without the coronavirus, then the whole process collapsed in the face of this epidemic. In order to effectively counteract the epidemic, the authorities of nearly all countries, including those of the West, have introduced compulsory quarantine with strict measures for its violation, or have outright declared emergency situations. The economic mechanisms of the global market have collapsed due to closure of borders, as have stock exchanges and financial institutions. The open society and unhindered migration have come into direct contradiction with basic sanitary standards. In fact, a dictatorial regime has rapidly been established all over the world, under which power has been transferred to a completely new entity. Neither \"the Ego\", nor \"its Own\", nor all of the world's giant superstructures that guaranteed their legal and legitimate rights and statuses are any longer considered the source of political power. What Giorgio Agamben has called the \"naked life\", i.e., the absolutely special, physical survival imperative that has nothing to do with the logic of liberal capitalism, has come to the foreground. Neither equality, rights, law, private property, collective decision-making, the system of mutual obligations, nor any other fundamental principle of liberal democracy has real power. Only those mechanisms that contribute to survival, to stopping infection and providing for the simplest, purely physiological, needs, are important now.\nBut this means that the subject of power is radically changing. It is no longer the free society, nor the market, nor the humanist presumptions of the sovereign individual, nor guarantees of personal freedom and private life. All of this is to be sacrificed if the matter at hand is physical survival. Political rights are abolished, economic obligations are abolished, total surveillance and strict disciplinary control become the only overriding social norm.\nIf the \"world government\" has gone into a state of emergency, proved unable to or did not even dare to bypass it, or was simply forced to accept it, then this means that the paradigm which just yesterday seemed to be unshakeable has been abandoned. And in this case, there is either no \"world government\" at all, and every society saves itself as it can, or the fundamental paradigm abruptly changes and turns into something else. Both in the first and in the second cases, the former order has collapsed, and something new is being built before our very eyes.\nSuch radical conclusions are not just related to the scale of the pandemic, which is not even so great yet. Much more important is the perception of the epidemic by the power elites, who have so quickly and easily abandoned their seemingly inviolable foundations. That is the most fundamental thing. The measures aimed at combating the coronavirus have already undermined the foundations of liberal democracy and capitalism, rapidly abolishing the subject of power itself. From now on, the \"ego and its own\" is no longer the basis of legality and legitimacy: under the conditions of the State of Emergency, power is being transferred to another authority. Something new is becoming the bearer of sovereignty.\nSo what is it?\nThe coronavirus as the ruling subject: the secular gods of the plague\nOn the one hand, it could be said that the coronavirus itself (the virus has its \"royal\" name for a reason) is demonstrating a status unique to that of the subject. To better understand this, we can recall the ancient plague gods, who were considered formidable deities in the religious beliefs of the peoples of the Middle East. The peoples of Mesopotamia had Erra, Nergal, and others, and in the monotheistic traditions, in particular in Judaism, plagues were sent by the supreme deity, Yahweh, to punish the Jews for idolatry. In the Middle Ages, epidemics and plagues were considered signs of divine punishment. Traditional society can justifiably give the status of subjectivity to large-scale phenomena or link them to the divine element. However, in the New Time of Modernity, man held himself to be the complete master of life, hence the development of modern medicine, drugs, vaccines, etc. Therefore, it is as if the complete inability of governments to counteract the coronavirus today is casting mankind beyond the edge of New Time. But the God or gods to whom the modern virus plague could be ascribed and left to no longer exist. The modern world is convinced that the virus must have earthly, material and immanent origin. But what kind of materiality is stronger than man? Hereby arise the many conspiracy theories linking the origin of the virus to malefactors aspiring to establish their control over mankind. For the philosophers of \"speculative realism,\" who for decades have been thinking about the need to replace humanity with a system of objects - whether Artificial Intelligence or cyborgs - the virus itself might very well be granted the status of sovereign actor, a kind of hyperobject (a la Morton) capable of subjugating the masses of beings to its will, as does mold, the rhizome, and so on. In other words, the collapse of the liberal model brings to the forefront the hypothesis of the post-human, post-humanist actor.\nCoronavirus, whose Latin name literally means “the crowned poison”, is thus (at least theoretically) a contender for the center of the new world system. If the main concern of mankind from now on will be to counteract the virus, fight against it, protect against it, etc., then the whole system of values, rules and guarantees will be rebuilt according to absolutely new principles and priorities. Speculative realists go even further and are ready to recognize in the hyperobject the presence of infernal entities of the ancient gods of chaos emerging out of the bottom of existence, but it is not necessary to go that far, insofar as, if we simply assume that\npolitical, economic and ideological rationality will henceforth be built around the counteraction of contagious viruses, we will live in a different - for example, in a hygienocentric - world, organized in a completely different way than the modern world. The \"Ego\", \"its Own\" and all the structures which guarantee them predictability, stability and protection, which elevate them to the status of the foundations of legality and legitimacy, will fall into the background, while the coronavirus or its analogue will establish a different hierarchy, a different political and economic ontology, a different ideology.\nThe state vs. coronavirus. But which state?\nIf we look at how the fight against coronavirus is unfolding today, we can notice an abruptly sharp increase in the role of the state, which over the course of globalization was considerably relegated to the back-burner. It is at the level of the state that decisions on quarantine, self- isolation, travel bans, restrictions on freedoms and economic measures, are being made. In fact, everywhere in the world - whether openly or by default - a state of emergency has been declared. According to the classics of political thought, and in particular Carl Schmitt, this means the establishment of a regime of dictatorship. The sovereign, according to Schmitt, is he who makes the decision in an emergency situation (Ernstfall), and today this is the state. However, it should not be forgotten that today’s state has until the altogether recent last moment been based on the principles of liberal democracy, capitalism, and the ideology of human rights. In other words, this state is, in some sense, deciding on the liquidation of its own philosophical and ideological basis (even if such are for now formalized, temporary measures, the Roman Empire still began with the temporary dictatorship of Caesar, which gradually became permanent). Thus, the state is rapidly mutating, just as the virus itself is mutating, and the state is following the coronavirus in this constantly evolving struggle, which is taking the situation ever further from the point of global liberal democracy. All the extant borders which until yesterday seemed to be erased or half-erased are once again gaining fundamental meaning - not only for those who are going to cross them, but also for those who simply have managed in time to return to their country. At the same time, in larger countries this fragmentation is being carried over to individual regions, where states of emergency are leading to the establishment of their own, regional dictatorships, which in turn will be strengthened as communication with the center becomes more difficult. Such fragmentation will continue all the way down to small towns and even individual households, where forced closure will open up new horizons and volumes of domestic violence.\nThe state is taking upon itself the mission of fighting the coronavirus under certain conditions, but is waging this fight in already different circumstances. Over the course of this mission, all state institutions related to law, legality and economy are being transformed. Thus, the very introduction of quarantine completely overturns the logic of the market, according to which only the balance of supply and demand and the agreements concluded between employer and employee can regulate the relations between them. Bans on working for hygienic reasons are irrevocably collapsing the entire construction of capitalism. The suspension of freedom of\nmovement, assembly and democratic procedures is blocking the institutions of political democracy and paralyzing individual freedoms.\nPost-liberal dictatorship\nOver the course of this epidemic, a new state is emerging which is beginning to function with new rules. It is very likely that in the process of the state of emergency there will be a shift of power from formal rulers to technical and technological functionaries, e.g., the military, epidemiologists, and institutions especially created for such extreme circumstances. The physical threat which the virus poses to leaders is forcing them to be placed in special conditions that are not always compatible with full control over situations. As legal norms are suspended, new algorithms of behavior and new practices are beginning to be deployed. Thus is born the dictatorial state, which, unlike the liberal-democratic state, has completely different goals, foundations, principles and axioms. In this case, the \"world government\" is dissolved, because any supranational strategy loses all meaning. Power is rapidly moving to an ever lower level - but not to society and not to citizens, but to the military-technological and medical-sanitary level. A radically new rationality is gaining force - not the rationale of democracy, freedom, the market and individualism, but that of pure survival, for which responsibility is assumed by a subject combining direct power and the possession of technical, technological, and medical logistics. Moreover, in the network society, such is based on a system of total surveillance excluding any kind of privacy.\nThus, if at one end we have the virus as the subject of transformation, then at the other end we have military-medical surveillance and punitive dictatorship fundamentally differing in all parameters from the state that we knew until yesterday. It is not at all guaranteed that such a state, in its fight against the secular \"plague gods”, will precisely coincide with the borders of existing national entities. Since there will be no ideology or politics beyond the straightforward logic of survival, centralization itself will lose its meaning and its legitimacy.\nFrom civil society to \"naked life”\nHere once again let us recall the \"naked life\" of Giorgio Agamben, who in a similar vein and based on Schmitt's ideas on the \"state of emergency\" analyzed the situation in Nazi concentration camps, where the dehumanization of people attained the extreme, under which the \"naked life\" revealed itself. The “naked life” is not human life, but some other life that is beyond the limits of self-consciousness, personality, individuality, rights, and so on. Hence why Agamben has been more radical than others and opposed the measures taken against the coronavirus, preferring even death to the introduction of a state of emergency. He clearly saw that even a small step in this direction will change the entire structure of the world order. Entering the stage of dictatorship is easy, but exiting it is sometimes impossible.\nThe \"naked life” is the victim of the virus. It is not people, families, citizens, or private owners. Here there is neither one nor many. There is only the fact of infection, which can turn anyone - including oneself - into an other, and therefore into the enemy of \"naked life.” And it is fighting this other, \"naked life\" that grants dictatorship the new status of the subject. Then, society itself, at the mercy of dictatorship, will be turned into “naked life” organized by the dictatorship in accordance with its own peculiar rationality. Out of fear of the coronavirus, people are ready to go for any of the steps of those who have taken upon themselves responsibility for the state of emergency.\nThus, the fundamental split between the healthy and the sick, considered by Michel Foucault in his book \"Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison”, becomes even more impassable of a line than all the oppositions of the classical ideologies of Modernity, e.g., between the bourgeoisie and proletariat, the Aryans and Jews, the liberals and “enemies of the open society”, etc., and will see its dividing line set between the poles of the “naked life” and “medical technologists”, who have in their hands all the instruments of violence, surveillance, and authority. The difference between the already sick and the not yet sick which at first justified the new dictatorship will be erased, and the dictatorship of virologists, which has built new legitimacy on the basis of this distinction, will create a completely new model.\nThe new dictatorship is neither fascism nor communism\nThis situation will seem to many to be reminiscent of fascism or communism, but these parallels are imaginary. Both fascism and communism represented types of “civil society”, albeit totalitarian ones, with pronounced ideologies which guaranteed civil rights - not to all, but to the significant and, de facto, overwhelming majority of their citizens. Liberalism, by reducing all identities down to the level of the individual, paved the way and created the preconditions for a special type of post-liberal dictatorship that, unlike communism and fascism, should have no ideology at all, insofar as it will have no reason to persuade, mobilize, or \"seduce\" the element of the “naked life\". The \"naked life” is already consciously ready to surrender to dictatorship, regardless of what it promises or insists on. The structures of such a dictatorship will be built on the basis of the fact that it opposes the virus, not on the basis of ideas and preferences. The military-medical hygienic dictatorship will be characterized by a post-liberal logic, for which the only operation will be rational treatment of the \"naked life\", the bearers of which have no rights at all and no identity. This order will be built along the infected vs. healthy watershed, and this dual code will be as powerful as it is obvious, with no need for any justification or argumentation.\nArtificial Intelligence and its enemies\nHere the following consideration comes to mind: in the carriers of such a post-liberal anti-virus dictatorship, we see virtually no properly human traits. Any humanity would only hinder the most effective operation on the \"naked life\", and would thus represent a restless, trembling,\nsurvival-at-all-costs-seeking chaos. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence, abstract mechanical calculation, would cope best with this task. In military-medical dictatorship we see a distinct cybernetic dimension, something machine-like and mechanical. If the \"naked life\" is chaos, then there must be a cold mathematical order at the other pole. And from now on, its only legitimization will be not the consent of society, which loses everything but its survival instinct, but the very criterion of its ability to make balanced logical decisions without being affected by superfluous emotions and passions. Therefore, even if a military-medical hygienic dictatorship is established by people, sooner or later its main bearers will be machines.\nThere will be no return\nSeveral conclusions can be drawn from this very preliminary analysis of the near future - the future that has already begun:\n1. It is impossible to go back to the world order that existed only recently and which seemed so familiar and natural that no one thought about its ephemerality. Liberalism either did not reach its natural end and the establishment of a \"world government\", or nihilistic collapse was its original goal, merely covered by increasingly less convincing and increasingly perverse \"humanist\" decor. Proponents of philosophical \"accelerationism\" speak of \"Black Enlightenment,\" emphasizing this dark, nihilistic aspect of liberalism as representing merely the accelerated movement of man toward the abyss of post-humanism. But in any case, instead of \"world government\" and total democracy, we are entering an era of new fragmentation, of \"closed societies\" and radical dictatorship, perhaps exceeding Nazi concentration camps and the Soviet gulag.\n2. The end of globalization will not mean, however, a simple transition to the Westphalian system, to realism and a system of closed trade states (Fichte). Such would require the well- defined ideology that existed in early Modernity, but which was completely eradicated in late Modernity, and especially in Postmodernity. The demonization of anything remotely resembling “nationalism” or “fascism” has led to the total rejection of national identities, and now the severity of the biological threat and its crude physiological nature makes national myths superfluous. The military-medical dictatorship does not need additional methods to motivate the masses, and moreover, nationalism only enhances the dignity, self-consciousness and civil feeling of society which contradict the rules of the \"naked life\". For the society to come, there are only two criteria - healthy and sick. All other forms of identity, including national ones, have no meaning. Approximately the same was true for communism, which was also a motivating ideology that mobilized the consciousness of citizens to build a better society. All these ideologies are archaic, meaningless, redundant and counterproductive in the fight against coronavirus. Therefore, it would be wrong to see any \"new fascism\" or \"new communism\" in the impending post-liberal paradigm. It will be something else.\n3. It cannot be ruled out that this new stage will affect so greatly the life of humankind or what will remain of it that, having passed through all these trials and tribulations, mankind will be ready to accept any form of power, any ideology, and any order that will weaken the terror of the Artificial Intelligence-military-medical dictatorship. And then, in a cycle, we cannot rule out a return to the project of \"world government\", but this will already be on a completely different basis, because society will be irreversibly changed over the period of “quarantine\". It will no longer be the choice of \"civil society\", but the cry of \"naked life”, which will recognize any authority that can offer deliverance from the horror that has occurred. This would be the right time for what Christians call the \"Antichrist\" to appear.\nExaggeration and the liquidation of leaders\nIs such an analytical forecast too much of a dramatized exaggeration? I think it is quite realistic, although, of course, \"nobody knows the time\", and in any situation everything might be postponed for some time. The epidemic could end abruptly and a vaccine will be found. But all that has already happened in the first months of 2020 - the collapse of the world economy, all the radical measures in politics and international relations imposed by the pandemic, the disruption of civil society structures, psychological shifts and the introduction of surveillance-control technologies - is irreversible. Even if everything stops right now, it will take so long for liberal globalization to return to its ever-delayed finale that many critical aspects of society will have already undergone profound transformations. At the same time, the very assumption of a rapid end to the pandemic does not belong to the class of analysis, but to the realm of naive fairy tales with happy endings. Let us look truth in the eyes: the global liberal world has collapsed before our very eyes, just as the USSR and the world socialist system fell in 1991. Our consciousness refuses to believe in such colossal shifts, and especially in their irreversibility. But we must. It is better to conceptualize and comprehend them in advance - now, as long as things have not yet become so acute.\nFinally, it may seem that this pandemic is a chance for those political leaders who hypothetically would not mind taking advantage of such an extreme situation to strengthen their power. But this could work only for a short time, because the logic of the \"naked life\" and military-medical dictatorship belongs to a completely different register than the most authoritarian leader in the modern world system can imagine. Hardly any of today's rulers will be able to maintain their power for so long and so reliably under such extreme conditions. All of them, to one or another extent, derive their legitimacy from the structures of that liberal democracy which is being abolished before our very eyes. This situation will require completely different figures, competencies, and characters. Yes, they are likely to start this consolidation of power, and they have even begun to do so, but it is unlikely that they will last long.\nThere is something genuinely new awaiting us ahead, and it is most likely something really terrifying.\nRussian version - https://www.geopolitica.ru/article/pandemiya-i-politika-vyzhivaniya-gorizonty-diktatury-novogo-tipa"}, {"url": "http://24.com.eg/Mnwat/6207/%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-24--%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%84-%D8%AD%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-.html", "title": "Egypt 24 \"Corona\" ...

It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\nIn this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells.

A professor at Harvard University and two other Chinese citizens were charged on three separate occasions for lying to the United States because of their participation in the Chinese government.\nDr Charles Lieber, head of the chemistry and biology department at Harvard University was arrested for being paid $50,000/month by communist China and over 1.5 million for opening up a lab in Wuhan, China. Two other Chinese spies in US arrested as well. #CoronavirusPandemic pic.twitter.com/v6QFsTpoIC — Anna Khait (@Annakhait) April 5, 2020\nThe American television channel WCVB broadcast the official statement by the US Department of Justice and the detention of the scientist right in the office.\nAuthorities told reporters that the cases highlighted the ongoing threat posed by China, using unconventional intermediaries, academics and researchers, to steal US research and technology.\nDr. Charles Liber has received a series of accusations of working for China and links to a laboratory in Wuhan. The first charges went back in January, but now the excitement is becoming more acute, although he has not yet been charged with the virus itself.\n60-year-old Dr. Charles Lieber, who heads the Harvard Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, is accused of lying about working with several Chinese organizations. According to court documents, the Liberian research team at Harvard received more than $ 15 million in funding from National Institutes of Health and was affiliated with Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in China. Liber had a contract with a Chinese talent pool to attract high-level scholars to the country.\nNow the accusations have reached the official line. The messages say this:\n“Dr. Charles Lieber, head of the Department of Chemistry and Biology at Harvard University, was arrested because communist China paid him $ 50,000 a month, and more than $ 1.5 million to open a laboratory in Wuhan, China. Two other Chinese spies in the US have also been arrested. ”\nCharles Lieber is accused of not disclosing funding information that he received from the Chinese government.\nMeanwhile, British intelligence has put forward a version that the outbreak of coronavirus was caused by a leak from a Chinese laboratory. According to the Daily Mail, there are at least two laboratories in Wuhan that could have leaked: the Institute of Virology and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control.\nAccording to biosafety expert Professor Richard Ebright, he personally observed how scientists in these laboratories studied viruses, while not adhering to any safety requirements. The official authorities of Great Britain and China do not recognize the intelligence version. So the question of Charles Lieber’s activities in China will still be studied.\nOne of the points of accusation - earlier, Liber in official statements denied participation in this program and the presence of ties with the PRC. But, according to US prosecutors on the basis of hacked email by special services, in 2012, a scientist could sign a contract with ... Wuhan University of Technology. There, Liber allegedly received a substantial salary and research grant of $ 1 million (part of the amount usually goes to buy reagents and other expenses, and part to the scientist’s own pocket).\nGetting foreign grants is not a crime in itself. The crime for which Professor Lieber, for example, faces five years in prison, is withholding the fact of receiving a grant.\nWhat does the virus have to do with it? Lieber's research area is the medical use of nanotechnology. For example, how to deliver medicine to a diseased cell with the help of a nanorobot — a molecular-sized structure so as not to get an “immune response” (when the body rejects uninvited guests).\nBut it is easy to assemble a radio transmitter from a radio receiver, and a combat virus from a doctor-nanorobot. Which, on the contrary, affects healthy cells without provoking an immune response ... At least in theory. However, we emphasize that all this (as well as the hypothetical participation of Charles Lieber in the research of Wuhan virologists) is only a version, and quite speculative.\nANOTHER OPINION\nMikhail Friben, political scientist:\n- I am not a virologist; I cannot judge the origin of the “crown”. But all this is very similar to the next pogrom campaign in a friendly performance of the Western media. Likewise, exactly two years ago, on the basis of equally “convincing evidence”, the West accused Russia of “poisoning the Skripals in Salisbury,” using this as an excuse to strengthen sanctions.\nChina, although not without loss, was able to stop the epidemic. And while the world's largest economies are plunged into chaos, he uses this to strengthen his influence in the world. Of course, many do not like it. Hence the attempts to expose China as the culprit, and, possibly, impose sanctions against it. And there is always a reason (see “The Skripals case”).\nCaught in time\nThe news of the arrest of Professor Lieber in academia caused a scandal. Too big a scientist, and too surprising is the charge brought against him. Professor Lieber’s connections with China were well known: he is a foreign member of the Academy of Sciences and part-time member of several Chinese scientific societies. And the fact that the recipient of the millions of grants from the Ministry of Defense will be risking these grants (not to mention the reputation) for the sake of some $ 50 thousand seems to many to be completely impossible.\nBut it seems to them not only possible, but also quite likely that Professor Liber was the victim of a campaign to identify Chinese spies and their accomplices in the United States. This is indicated by many circumstances. After all, even the statement of special agent Bonavolanta began with the words that no country in the world poses a more serious and longer-term threat to national security and economic well-being of the United States than China. “In simple terms, China wants to take the place of the United States as the leading superpower of the world and is committing crimes for this purpose,” the agent said.\nShe was detained at the airport when she was returning to China. The FBI, however, did not explain why she was allowed to fly out of the country. But they arrested a certain Zheng Zhaoson. He also studied in Boston and was detained almost on board an airplane with stolen research data and several test tubes with samples of research material that he had hidden in his underwear.\nOutstanding, but not the only one\nHowever, not only the professor’s supporters believe that he is even the most significant, but nevertheless only one of the many American scientists working for China. According to The Wall Street Journal, when one of the universities in Texas decided to find out the number of employees receiving grants from China, it turned out that there were about a hundred such scientists at the university. But officially only five have notified of their ties with China.\nAs follows from the newspaper’s investigation, the relationship between the Chinese authorities and American scientists is approximately the same in all cases: the salary is at least $ 100 thousand a year higher than that obtained at the main place of work; $ 1 million for the opening of the laboratory and other bonuses, of course, not subject to American taxes.\nReference:\nCharles Liber (born Charles April 9, 1959, Philadelphia, PA) is an American chemical scientist.

Similar camps are to be found in Italy: Sicily and Calabria, the Southern parts of Italy where the migrants are helped by friendly EU-sponsored NGOs to come ashore from all parts of Africa and be used in the new slave market.\nThe southern parts of Italy and Spain are becoming the “ African“ slums of Europe, where hundreds of thousands of African migrant workers live under circumstances similar to, or perhaps even worse than, the slaves who worked on US cotton farms in the the 19th century. The supermarkets are full of cheap fruits and vegetables. Most of the goods come from Spain, but Italy is also an important supplier. How can countries produce so cheaply? A video reveals catastrophic working conditions. Spain and Italy provide us, the Europeans, with cheap fruits and vegetables, oranges, mandarins, tomatoes, and cucumbers. The big supermarkets of Europe, like Aldi, REWE, Lidl,Carrefour, Albert-Hein (called Albert in Eastern European countries) dictate the prices to the companies in Spain and Italy, who are subsidized by the European Union (EU). The EU has created a slave working force in the southern countries and subsidizes the big companies there with EU tax money. It makes you wonder and explains, on the other hand, the EU migration policy. They want “new” working slaves, like in Roman times, to provide the bourgeoisie with cheap fresh food and vegetables. The work on the fruit and vegetable farms, proposed by companies and accepted by workers, is without any contract. It's also without insurance and security guarantees in the workplace. The irregular migrants (those without legal permits) are being exploited by accepting these forms of work. Because they are working without a contract, they cannot ask for a residence permit, and vice versa; on the other hand, because they cannot claim rights as workers, except in cases where physical violence is suffered, they therefore remain victims of serious labor exploitation. Almeria, the southern part of Spain, hosts the biggest slum s , which are set on an arid patch of wasteland outside the small town of San Isidro. Almeria hosts the world's largest concentration of greenhouses. Covering over 31,000 hectares (76,600 acres) and visible from space, Almeria's \"sea of plastic\" produces roughly 3.5 million tonnes of fruit and vegetables per year. According to the regional distribution company Agrosol, 61% of Almeria's production is exported , with 99.8% bound for Europe – the Netherlands (13.55%), France (13.5%) and the UK (11.4%) being the top markets. Tomatoes: Germany (253,603,412 tonnes), the UK (145,786,239 tonnes) and the Netherlands (108,809,177 tonnes) Pepper : Germany (289,784,484 tonnes), France (117,876,979 tonnes) and the Netherlands (91,559,489 tonnes) Cucumber : Germany (176,469,357 tonnes), the Netherlands (63,069,737 tonnes) and the UK (59,003,974 tonnes ). This leads to a weird situation. Whoever in the Netherlands thinks that they're eating Dutch tomatoes is tricked since it’s all from the slave market in Spain. In reality, what is referred to as Almeria's \"economic miracle\" among Spanish economists, is almost exclusively dependent on an invisible, expendable, illegally employed migrant worker force working under 40-degree heat and extreme humidity. They live in slums, and when they can't cope anymore, another boat of \"refugees\" is waiting to come ashore and replace them. Coronavirus The coronavirus is getting out of control in the EU, especially in Italy and Spain. With these two being the suppliers of nearly all our fruit and vegetables, Europe may face a shortage of these products. Since a few days ago, there are riots in Southern Italy, a bad sign for the EU's import of fruits and vegetables from the slave market. If the lockdown continues, the prices will increase. On the other hand, the harvest of asparagus and apples is in danger in Germany and the Netherlands because these EU countries are dependent on the labor force from Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland. They harvest the asparagus and apples since there are no German or Dutch workers who want to do these kinds of jobs. The EU is at its end, which is painfully clear. Like in the old Roman Empire, the Vandalen brought upheaval to the Empire and eventually it broke down. This is what we see right now. The EU countries are unable to help each other, getting help from Russia and China instead, which the EU governments try to label as propaganda. The healthcare system has broken down a long time already. They don’t have masks, no electronic fever thermometers, and are imposing martial law.\nWhen they continue with the lockdown, it will be the end of Europe as we knew it. Russia and China will rise, and more and more EU countries know that “brotherhood” is non-existent.

Russia sends 8 mobile brigades of military virologists and doctors to Italy, diagnostic equipment, transport and area disinfection complexes, other medical equipment.\nThe Medical Special Forces includes about 100 leading specialists from the Russian Ministry of Defense in the field of virology and epidemiology, who have many years of experience in combating epidemics. The Russian landing party is equipped with all the necessary medical equipment and modern special equipment. In agreement with the Italian side, Russian military doctors and virologists will start fulfilling the set tasks.\nAt the behest of the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Armed Forces, Vladimir Putin, the Russian Ministry of Defense has set up an air force consisting of nine Il-76 aircraft to provide operational assistance to Italy. This air bridge will probably operate throughout Italy during the entire period of the Coronavirus epidemic. Russian specialists are waiting for a time-consuming and dangerous job. As of March 24, the number of people infected in Italy had reached 63,927, with 6,077 people killed in COVID-19.\nForces and means\nDuring a telephone conversation on March 21, the Presidents of Russia and Italy discussed the situation with the pandemic and measures to prevent infection. Vladimir Putin reaffirmed his readiness to help Italy.\nThe first Il-76, which landed at the Italian air base, was met by Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mayo and the Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic Enzo Vicherel, who on behalf of the Italian people thanked Russia for its assistance. It was a heartfelt thank you. Neighboring European neighbors have long been reluctant to provide even financial assistance to Italy.\nItaly definitely needs help from abroad, with 4,824 health care workers infected in the republic - twice as many as in China. However, everything is the opposite. The newspaper La Repubblica reports that the party of masks and respirators sent by the Chinese government to Italy has been removed by the Czech authorities. However, the Czech Republic has promised Italy the same amount of protection.\nThe North Atlantic Alliance is inactive. After sending several Russian military planes loaded with virologists and medical equipment to Italy, the Italian authorities appealed to the Pentagon for help. In particular, Italian Defense Minister Lorenzo Guerini asked US Secretary of Defense Mark Espera to send artificial lung ventilation equipment and medical masks. Rome also hopes to help US troops stationed in Italy as part of the US military. However, the request did not provoke an immediate response from Washington.\nThe ninth Il-76 flew to Italy on the morning of March 23. A group of military doctors with full staff and the necessary equipment is in Italy. Mobile disinfection complexes are located in the most affected areas of Italy. Apart from Russia, only medical groups from Venezuela, China and Cuba are helping Italy fight the epidemic at the state level.\nBy sending unique specialists, medical drugs and special equipment, Russia is primarily providing Italy with a successful military-medical experience in the fight against epidemics and dangerous diseases (Ebola, Siberian ulcers, etc.). Of course, Russian specialists will also gain new invaluable experience in fighting the lesser-known virus in Italy.\nMedical Special Forces\nVirtually all members of a group of Russian specialists sent to Italy are from the elite of military virologists and world-class physicians. For example, Major General Sergei Kikot is the head of the Medical Special Forces. He has extensive experience working in the most difficult epidemiological conditions of Siberian ulcers, eliminating the consequences of epidemics.\nLeading scientist-epidemiologist, Candidate of Medical Sciences, Colonel Alexei Smirnov is the author of more than 70 scientific papers. Actively participates in the development of a vaccine against Ebola.\nCandidate of Medical Sciences Gennady Eremin - a leading researcher at the Scientific Research Center, an authoritative specialist in organizing and conducting anti-epidemic measures.\nCandidate of Medical Sciences, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Yumanov worked on the creation of a mobile hospital in the framework of the international program to fight Ebola in the Republic of Guinea, etc.\nIt should be noted that the Russian army has not yet spread coronavirus - largely thanks to such a high level of science and practicing doctors.\nAnd yet, the March 20 meeting of the Russian Defense Ministry began with a discussion of the problem of COVID-19. One week ago, an operational headquarters was set up to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the armed forces, and special units were trained in 32 hospitals to detect the disease among the military. Special exercises of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense Troops with the participation of doctors were held on March 18-19 to stabilize the epidemiological situation and fight infection.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry hopes that everything will be fine, but is always ready for any scenario.

Recently, Hong Kong was stunned by the news that their favorite Jackie Chan was also a victim of the virus and is in quarantine.\nThe basis for such rumors was the corporate party of the Hong Kong police, where, allegedly, a Hollywood star was invited. As it turned out, several police officers were infected with a coronavirus.\nA video appeared on the Internet from a corporate party, where, in addition to Jackie Chan, there were other famous actors. Fans recognized Eric Zahn and Alan There. The audience was outraged by the fact that none of the guests of the event wore a mask, although the situation in the city was considered rather complicated.\nIn confirmation of this, some time after the video appeared on the network, the city police informed that after the corporate party 59 employees were forced to quarantine, because four of their colleagues had symptoms of coronavirus. The tests confirmed a disappointing diagnosis, and the spouse and mother-in-law of one of them were added to the four patients.\nFor this reason, many fans of the famous actor were seriously excited, but as it turned out later that day, two special events took place in the city and Jackie Chan was present at another party, which was not related to the one where the police officers had fun, seeing off well-deserved rest of his comrade.\nJackie himself hastened to refute this information, however, skeptics still doubt it. Otherwise, why would he offer a reward of 1 million yuan to someone who comes up with a vaccine?

It should be noted that this decision was made by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos (January 21-24, 2020) behind closed doors as a completely non-medical and political body. This was attended by Dr. Tedros, Director-General of WHO, who, for the first time in the history of WHO, was not a doctor himself.\nThe short, medium, and long-term consequences of this decision will have a dimension that no one is able to understand at present. It can lead to such a change in the paradigm of our life and the life of society, which mankind has not experienced in the last 200 years or more.\nIn Germany, honest scientists begin to move, they confront the authorities, providing them with facts. Dr. Suharit Bhakdi, Emeritus Professor of Medical Microbiology at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, sent an open letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, calling for an urgent re-evaluation of the answer to Covid-19, asking the Chancellor five important questions.\nWhat about China, you may ask? China is a special case. Virologists in Wuhan discovered very early that what was originally called 2019-nKoV (WHO renamed it COVID-19) was nothing more than a more powerful mutation of the SARS virus that hit Hong Kong and China in 2002-2003 and killed 774 people worldwide. Since the SARS virus was specifically created for the Chinese genome, a Chinese scientist discovered that his new and stronger mutation was also focused on Chinese DNA.\nChina also knew that since it was a laboratory virus, since it came from outside - probably from the USA, which are waging an economic war against China. A deadly virus can be an ideal - and invisible - tool to weaken China and its economy. Therefore, without hesitation, China quarantined the vast territories of the country, and then proceeded to a complete blockade. Thanks to this quick reaction from Chairman Xi and nationwide discipline, China now controls COVID-19, and the country's economy is recovering quickly.\nIt is like a global coup d'etat carried out by an invisible \"dark deep state.\" Some selected countries impose curfews and even house arrests for everyone - not with weapons or bombs, not with tanks on the streets and police repressive forces, but with the help of an invisible tiny enemy, a microscopic virus. Can you imagine that? Invented is just a genius. Control the world with a virus. He must be given his due. 0.01% of the population put 99.99% of the population on their knees and forced to ask for mercy. Begging for vaccinations, not knowing about the cocktail of substances that this malicious dark force wants to enter into your body. “Please bring us the vaccines!” People will run out into the streets - when it will be allowed again - to offer their hands and bodies to everyone who comes with a syringe.\nInjections can be harmful sterilizing agents that can cause long-term neurological damage - damage that can be passed on to future generations. They may contain DNA-manipulating proteins - agents that reduce life. Injections can also contain an electronic nanochip that will track all personal data - from medical records to bank accounts. In a state of complete despair, people are not interested in knowing anything. They just want to get rid of fear and sleep peacefully again at night.\nThis human-made pandemic outbreak is not new. Of course, the mainstream media does not mention that the COVID-19 coronavirus was produced in the laboratory (like SARS, MERS, H1N1, swine flu, Ebola, Zika and many others), and that outbreaks in the past and now are focused on specific population groups. In fact, in the infamous Plan for a New American Century (PNAC), which is still very much alive; its 2000 update on p. 60 mentions that future wars may not be fought with conventional or nuclear weapons, but with invisible substances, biological weapons, and viruses. They are more effective than conventional weapons and do not destroy infrastructure.\nThis new “crown” is a new bonanza for Big Farm. It was planned for years and used the 2009 swine flu outbreak and the H1N1 virus. This went on for about a year - from April 2009 to April 2010. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 12,500 people died from swine flu in the United States, and around 300,000 died worldwide. Unlike COVID-19, the vast majority, about 80%, infected with the H1N1 virus were younger than 65 years old.\nThen, as today, WHO announced a pandemic. For the pharmaceutical industry, this has become a green signal for vaccine production. Big Pharma promised it could produce 4.9 billion H1N1 flu vaccines. As a result, the industry has provided millions of doses to governments that had not been used by the time they arrived, since the flu had passed by then. Taxpayers paid billions in vain. Because seasonal flu mutates from year to year, storing vaccines is useless. What have some governments done? Listen to this! They sent them to Africa as development assistance. Where the vaccines, of course, were completely useless.\nToday we are again faced with a tireless, propaganda machine working around the clock and seven days a week, which spreads fear and anxiety about an invisible virus. An enemy that the population does not see. An enemy that cannot be traced. For example, to understand how it is distributed - or not distributed. An enemy about whom people simply have to believe the authorities that it exists. How clever! Advocacy and fear are enough to conquer the population of the whole world in a few weeks.\nFor example, a new study by the University of Oxford concluded that COVID-19 is likely to exist in the UK since January 2020, and that at the same time, about half of the UK population was infected and thus immunized against this virus. Most people have no symptoms or only lungs. This will mean that only about 1 out of 1000 infected people should be hospitalized, which corresponds to the usual flu or lower.\nDr. David Katz, American physician and founding director of Yale University’s Prevention Research Center, notes: “I’m deeply concerned that the social, economic, and administrative consequences of this almost total collapse of normal life — the closure of schools and businesses, banned meetings — will be long-lasting and catastrophic, perhaps even more serious than the direct damage from the virus itself. The stock market will rebound over time, and many enterprises will never. Unemployment, impoverishment and despair are likely to be disasters of the highest class for public health. ”\nNone of those who fueled the pandemic panic seem to have a clear idea of the big picture. Government officials around the world are co-opted. They follow orders. They know what they must do, otherwise ... This is an important step towards a gigantic change in the social paradigm in the interests of the Kingdom of the New World Order (RIGHT NOW).\nOn a positive note ...\nDarkness is followed by light. This is the universal law of nature. And as they say, each dark cloud has a silver lining. Could it be that this low-intensity jerking of the world can have a rejuvenating effect? A significant part of the polluting industrial enterprises has been destroyed, and now comes a healthier, oxygenated air. Air and water are in a constant cycle. They move fast and endlessly. Even a short break in mockery of nature can lead to vivid results, which, in turn, can cause changes in human behavior. And a whole new ecological reality may appear.\nThe trees breathe again, the ocean begins to rebuild its ever-moving marine life, the heavy industrial pipes emitting carbon dioxide have stopped doing this - the sky has become bluer, the grass is greener, and the birds are singing joyfully again. Dream? Some of this may have already begun. Perhaps there will be some people who will awaken in this new potentially cleaner, healthier and safer environment, in a world of smiles, where light is reflected, which is gradually replacing darkness. New, clean and safe forms of life can be born and come into the world. Surely we do not know this. But we hope so. The dynamics are unpredictable, but endless.\nWe, humanity, have the spiritual ability to abandon the trajectory of the disaster of Western neoliberal capitalism and instead support solidarity, compassion and love for each other, for our society and for Mother Earth, nourishing a new era of Light.\nPosted by Peter Koenig - Peter Koenig is a researcher at the Center for Research on Globalization [CRG], Montreal, Canada), an economist and geopolitical analyst who previously worked at the World Bank.

The circumstances of the \"Wuhan syndrome\" epidemic led to suspicion", "text": "Coronavirus - a new US bio-weapon? The circumstances of the epidemic of \"Wuhan syndrome\" led to suspicion\nLDPR head Vladimir Zhirinovsky called the outbreak of coronavirus a biological attack by the United States. Biological and chemical weapons expert Igor Nikulin and KP military observer Viktor Baranets pointed out all the suspicious details of the virus outbreak in China.\nLDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky said that the cause of an outbreak of coronavirus in China could be Americans, and the virus itself - biological weapons of the United States. How true are the assumptions of the politician, a former member of the UN Commission on Biological and Chemical Weapons, military expert Igor Nikulin and military observer of Komsomolskaya Pravda Viktor Baranets commented on Constantinople.\n\"How well, on New Year's Eve\"\nAccording to Igor Nikulin, there are more than enough reasons for suspicions that the coronavirus is a US biological weapon. Firstly, the time and place are too well chosen to be considered a mere coincidence. Now between China and the United States, the height of the trade war, and US President Donald Trump half a year ago, said that if the Chinese did not change their minds, they would regret it.\nWhy the outbreak occurred in Wuhan, and not in Beijing, Hong Kong or Shanghai, is also approximately clear. In Hong Kong, there is a pro-American Maidan. There are a lot of American representative offices in Shanghai, almost all American companies are there, thousands of Americans work there, if not tens of thousands. And Beijing is the capital, there are too much control measures, there are a million cameras with face fixation, the expert explains.\nSo they chose where the control is weaker, respectively, plus the fact that there is an institute of virology there is also good, you can blame the Chinese that they arranged everything for themselves, so successfully and on New Year’s, Igor Nikulin said in an interview with Tsargrad.\nIn addition, there was an American consulate in Wuhan. But they closed it, and before the Chinese announced an epidemic, the expert says. So they knew about it beforehand? The information is also not in their favor, says Nikulin.\nThat is, there are many details that show that this is no coincidence, ”he emphasizes.\nThe expert also recalls that until 2000, coronavirus never passed to humans. And since the Americans in 1999 adopted a program to create ethnically specific biological weapons, eight out of 38 viruses have already passed from animals to humans.\nThis is somehow too much. For thousands of years, never, but here in 20 years, eight dangerous viruses appeared at once, ”says Igor Nikulin.\nEconomic strangulation\nThe military observer of \"KP\" Viktor Baranets agrees with his opinion. He points out that today in the world there are approximately 400 centers and laboratories in the United States of America that develop biological weapons. And about 40 of them are located near the Russian borders.\nAs for China, the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak occurred, is located in the very center of the country. That is an ideal place for the spread of a dangerous virus throughout China, Baranets explains. In addition, the outbreak happened just before the Chinese New Year. That is, another 5 million people additionally came to the 11-million city, and when the first symptoms appeared, these 5 million had already gone somewhere, the expert points out. In this regard, he also recalls Trump’s promise to make China \"regret\" that he got involved in a trade war with the United States.\nAnd here it turns out, in general, that if you take and launch the coronavirus, then China will suffer huge economic losses. And this is a favorite feature of the current White House policy. Now they do not swing missiles, tanks, guns and so on. Look, the United States has embarked on the economic strangulation of competitors, ”Viktor Baranets notes in an interview with Tsargrad.\nAs examples, he cites the story of sanctions against Nord Stream 2, as well as the threat of sanctions against countries that have expressed a desire to buy Russian weapons.\nThus, we can say that coronavirus is already, so to speak, a new way of the struggle of the United States of America for global superiority over its main opponents. I do not rule out. But I speak carefully. This is my version that I am building, - said Victor Baranets.\n\"Chinese coronavirus is not like the others\": Scientists have revised the version of the origin of the 2019-nCoV virus\n“There may be severe side effects”: Coronavirus drug list published\nNot only pneumonia: the Ministry of Health has warned doctors how a new coronavirus may manifest"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX4BkJzAoGk&t=145", "title": "The fewer people, the better for globalists: The horns of coronavirus, the bacteriological weapon of the United States", "text": "LEARN MORE ON THE LINK: https: //news-front.info/2020/03/16/ch ...\n#Ukraine, #VladimirRogov, #Samomdele,\nPolitical columnist Vladimir Rogov commented on what is happening in the world and Ukraine today.\nVladimir Rogov noted that today we see how the world is changing under the influence of the coronavirus, which is a specific infection and bacteriological weapon of the United States.

Given that China is the number one country in the world today. “Back in 2015, American scientists in uniform published the results of experiments on bats, noting that this could be carried over to people,” says Rogov.\nRegarding the spread of this virus, a political observer emphasized that the EU has shown that it is not a second world country.

Some are higher, much higher. In some areas temporary hospitals are being used but more often non-COVID patients are being “turfed” to rural medical centers where their needs may not be properly addressed.\nAs with any emergency, the first victim is truth. Social media lends itself toward sensationalism and can attract those with victimization fantasies. Thus, only information from known sources is accepted and nothing from mainstream or social media can be trusted.\nThe situation in American hospitals, not all but more than the public would imagine, is grave. Currently, PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) is in good supply with the exception of N95 masks and that situation is rapidly improving.\nAvailability of ventilators in the US is currently very good, thanks to individuals like Elon Musk, the governments of Russia and China and many charitable organizations that have gone to great efforts.\nBy “very good” we are speaking of supplies as predictive modeling indicates. One of the problems, however, is that the predictive models are predicated on assumptions not in evidence and are failing. This critical failure, and the cloak of secrecy around it, has given rise to the lunacy and subterfuge we are seeing in Washington.\nPart of that failure is at hospital level.\nTo clarify, the issue is getting patents off ventilators. Nearly half of those on ventilators now are at or above 10 days and face a poor outcome. Claims that half may die are low. Most or all will die unless a late stage treatment protocol is developed in time.\nThis is a life and death race and we are losing.\nMoreover, many patients who are never intubated but stay on cannula for oxygen, as we are told was the case with Boris Johnson, seem to recover then quickly succumb for no apparent reason.\nJohnson likely received Remdesivir, which has been denied other NHS patients. If so, the political fallout for Johnson, whose policies left the NHS grossly unprepared for the COVID 19 pandemic, will and should be catastrophic.\nThe biggest morbidity factors are the following:\n- Age (60 plus)\n- Obesity\n- Smoking\n- Diabetes\n- Any other cardiopulmonary issues\nThe glaring question of irregular morbidity figures must be addressed. This is what we have learned:\n- The healthcare systems of Italy and Spain were very much “not as represented.” Claims that the hospitals of Northern Italy, in particular, are among the “best in the world” is patently false. Were it not for Russian and Chinese aid, both Italy and Spain would have collapsed. Standards of care considered “normal” in Britain, France, Belgium, Spain and Italy rate at or below the worst in the US.\n- That said, with massive medical infrastructure, the US was blindsided as well. Twenty percent of COVID 19 victims are healthcare professionals. Past that, vital support personnel for health care are primarily African American or Hispanic.\n- This has given rise to issues of specific genetic vulnerabilities which are likely at this point overemphasized. Households with healthcare and support workers most often have one or more adults working away from home, often in areas of very high exposure.\n- Past this we look at Iran, hard hit early on. If figures are to be believed, Iran peaked on March 29, 2020 and is showing a steady decline in new patients barring a second wave. Iran’s testing program has been more aggressive than most and if these figures are reliable, they offer some hope to nations, unlike the United States, that took the threat seriously.\nThe material offered here is an intelligence briefing on a vital situation. The US government is keeping secret, even from state governors, the real situation with the COVID 19 pandemic, as a first wave, ending many lockdowns, by May 1, 2020 is planned.\nThere is nothing worse than an election year in the United States, nothing worse except, maybe, an election year with a nation fully engaged in not just a pandemic but economic collapse as well.\nNever has the very real threat of extremism and totalitarianism been this close for the United States. We will be addressing this issue, the failure of governance but also the “elephant in the room,” how the lockdowns themselves are a panacea.\nOur models are failing, based on mixed data on acquired immunity. We have had several reports this week that reinfection rates are high, particularly from South Korea.\nBy the first week of February, the US had reached one of two scenarios, that could have only been mitigated by a quick vaccine, not possible, and assumptions on immunity that were not evidence based:\n- Where a 10 lockdown would have applied on February 1, a two-month lockdown from mid-March to mid-May is likely to lead to waves of reinfection, through September. Lockdown beyond that would do nothing and economic factors dictate opening up, taking the extinction level hit, to an unimaged level.\n- This scenario advocates a May 1 end to lockdown, if continued reliable reinfection reports come in, which is likely to give us a “wash through” lasting until February 2021.\nOption 2 is most likely and may well be inexorable, a “wash through” combined with waves of reinfection. New treatment protocols, and there few showing promise, would be the priority. Generally, Hydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine is facing a dim future. Side effects are devastating, and effectiveness has, thus far, been in only moderate cases and anecdotal.\nConvalescent serum is at an experimental stage and weeks from deployment. Initial tests show it to be useful in a percentage of cases with the following caveat, patients thus far either improve quickly or die of a reaction to the serum.\nThis information is being withheld.\nWe have promising antivirals, but these have only been used in non-defining test situations that, out of humanitarian concerns, do not have a double-blind.\nWe are hopeful.\nSaying we have reached an ‘end of the world as we know it’ has both good and bad connotations. Large military forces are no longer in the cards for the major powers. It has been proven how easy it is to take a ship at sea down.\nThere are so many ways to target infections to diminish military capability, there is now a weapon that makes any state a major player again, and the US is entirely to blame with their massive biological weapon research program. You see, the US allowed the program to filter into the universities for ‘cover” as numerous treaties are being violated. Every president since and including Clinton has a hand in this.\nBush 41 tried to stop this and this and other reasons were why his presidency was ended, a story that will never be told. Bush learned early about the planning of 9/11 and watched Clinton increasingly lose control of the reins as right wing extremist elements in Washington partnered with rogue elements in the Pentagon, CIA and the criminal elites of the former Soviet Union, soon to make up the core of the Kosher Nostra crime syndicate.\nTrump’s handling of this issue, if one is to assume his blunder was unintended, is the single biggest failure of governance in American history.\nWhile covering his tracks, working with organized crime to foster internal rebellion, wrongly targeting China and continually diminishing the presidency, a wave of damage that may eventually be more costly than the pandemic itself has been fomented.\nOil will never be the same. Fracking will never be profitable, current pipelines and refineries under construction are now useless as are those built in recent years, many at incredible cost to the environment.\nRussia’s moves into the Arctic are now likely to be curtailed.\nA good example will be Norway. Their GDP for the next 48 months, even without a permanent market contraction, will be down by 15% with exports down 40% or a bit more.\nThey will move from a social welfare state with a very high standard of living to a debtor nation in less than 5 years.\nThis is a best-case scenario for the wealthiest of nations.\nSaudi Arabia is entering uncharted waters. Clearly, Saudi Arabia and the UAE will end their issues with Iran. From Press TV:\n“A Saudi whistleblower has said that the number of Saudi royals infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19) has “exceedingly surpassed” figures previously revealed by a New York Times report.\nThe Saudi al-Ahd al-Jadid Twitter account made the revelations on Friday, more than a week after the NYT report said as many as 150 Saudi royals had contracted the virus.\nThe report at the time said that over 500 beds were being prepared at the elite King Faisal Specialist Hospital that treats members of the Saudi family.\nOn Friday, however, al-Ahd al-Jadid, which is known for whistleblowing on high-profile cases within the Saudi court, revealed that the Saudi hospital reserved for the royals in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah had been overwhelmed with coronavirus cases.\n“The Jeddah specialist hospital, which is reserved for Saudi royals, is no longer capable of accepting new cases,” the Twitter account said.\n“Therefore, two hotels have been reserved to be fully used for accommodating and curing infected royals,” it added, naming one of the hotels as being the “Movenpick Hotel”.\nAs of 1400 GMT on Friday, more than 7,142 confirmed coronavirus cases were reported in the kingdom, with 87 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.\nAnother Saudi whistleblower, Mujtahid, however, has cast doubt on official figures, arguing that the situation throughout the kingdom is much more critical.\nThe reports of the COVID-19 disease spreading among royals come as the Saudi family is embroiled in a bitter power struggle between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his potential rivals, according to reports.”\nNations like Iraq have been, thus far, exceptionally effective in limiting the spread of the pandemic. Their last case was on April 16, 2020 and thus far register only 82 deaths with over 500 active patients.\nTurkey is reporting a possible downturn, as of April 14, with new cases peaking a few days earlier at around 4500 new cases a day. Turkey, however, has nearly 80,000 active patients and has been accused of significant underreporting.\nRussia’s COVID 19 surge began in April but cases are a small fraction of what the US is seeing with a mortality rate, based on official reports, half of that in the US.\nConclusion\nCOVID 19, a disease that many experts weren’t expecting for a hundred thousand years, is a highly modified version of the Wuhan Horseshoe Bat Virus. It is not plausible that COVID 19 developed without a gene-splicing laboratory. The odds against such a disease developing naturally are astronomical yet we are continually informed of the opposite.\nIn order to prepare this, front line medical personnel were interviewed, even interrogated to an extent, within parameters of required tenets of patient privacy laws. The truth, the horror of the truth, is worse than the dramatic twitter video. We are asking too much of far too few and this should never be allowed to happen again.\nWe have turned medical personnel/first responders into “cannon fodder.”\nGordon Duff is a Marine combat veteran of the Vietnam War that has worked on veterans and POW issues for decades and consulted with governments challenged by security issues.

To the layman, it's just a stronger mutation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, which broke out in 2002/2003, also in China. Without a doubt, a mutation made in a laboratory. In an American high-security biological warfare laboratory. In other words, both SARS and COVID-19, among many other biological warfare agents, were manufactured in the USA. USA\nAnd now, the chaotic race of western-style private corporations for a vaccine that wants to outdo each other has begun.\nWho is the first to develop a vaccine? - It is fierce competition to establish a patent, a monopoly, for a possibly multi-million dollar business. Its neoliberal western capitalism at its worst, or better, depending on the angle from which it is viewed.\nThere are no words to describe this chaotic fever for profit on human well-being. It has nothing to do with health, with the healing of sick and suffering, possibly of people who die. It's all about money. Hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of profits for the pharmaceutical oligarch and its associated research labs and companies. And even more, if the WHO-declared \"pandemic\" (sic) will drive a forced vaccination campaign, enhanced by military and police surveillance.\nLet's put COVID-19 in context. As of March 23, 2020 (18:33 GMT), and according to WHO statistics, the reported global cases are 372,572; deaths 16,313; recovered 101,373 - a mortality rate of 4.37%. However, these figures should be viewed with caution. In many countries, especially in developing economies, accurate testing can be a problem. Test kits are often unavailable or unreliable. Therefore, it is possible that people who go to the doctor with some flu symptoms may be falsely diagnosed as victims of COVID-19, as it is used for advertising.\nEven miscalculations and false reports can occur in the United States. Mr. Robert Redfield, CEO of the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC), testified before Congress that CDC no longer conducts regular testing, which was done at the state level and only in extreme cases. See also this reference form on LA Times of California measures and directives.\nIn comparison, the CDC of EE. USA They estimate that only in the 2019/2020 flu season in the US. In the US, 38 to 54 million people can get the common flu, and 23,000 to 59,000 can die from it. The vast majority of these deaths will be people over the age of 70 and many of them with pre-existing health and / or respiratory problems. This is more or less the same pattern of illness and death as with COVID-19. Expanding these common flu numbers globally linearly would lead to hundreds of thousands of flu deaths. In the US flu season. USA 2017-2018 particularly strong, an estimated 60,000 people died from the flu in the US alone. USA The reader himself can judge whether the WHO was justified in declaring COVID-19 a 'pandemic', or whether there may have been, perhaps, another agenda behind it.\nThe vaccine that could eventually be applied to COVID-19 is probably no longer valid for the next coronavirus outbreak, which, according to Mr. Redfield, CDC, is likely to occur. A subsequent virus will surely have mutated. It is quite similar to the common flu virus. In fact, the common influenza virus that repeats annually contains a 10% to 15% (sometimes more) proportion of coronaviruses.\nThe effectiveness of annual flu vaccines is on average less than 50%, not to mention all the possible harmful side effects that come with it. COVID-19 is very similar to the flu. Will a coronavirus vaccine be equally weak to protect a potential patient from future infection?\nCooperation instead of competition does not occur in the west. It all depends on earnings. With a number of different vaccines from different giant pharmacies hitting the market, who will tell the patient which one is the best and most appropriate for the patient's condition? Smells like an absolute chaotic scam.\nThe real question is: are vaccines or a vaccine necessary? Maybe, maybe not. Vaccine production is driven for profit and for an important political agenda for a New World Order, which has been planned to change human life as we know it, or think we knew it. See more explanations below.\nVaccines do not heal, they can prevent the virus from hitting as hard as it would otherwise, or not at all, depending on a person's age, fitness, and health. Global statistics show that generally a person in their 40s or 50s, who is infected with COVID-19, has none or only mild symptoms, there is nothing to worry about.\nIf symptoms appear, staying home, resting, and using traditional medications from yesteryear, just as you could use for the common flu, might be enough to get rid of the virus. This could resolve the disease in one to two weeks. Then the person will naturally be \"vaccinated\" against this coronavirus chain. People over the age of 65 or 70 may be at higher risk and special care may be in order: separated from the crowds, isolation during a two-week quarantine (the incubation period), while the rest of society continues to life as normal as possible, thus reducing the enormous cost to society.\nChina has controlled the COVID-19 pandemic without a vaccine, but using common sense and low-cost, traditional medication. What are these regular medications that are effective and have helped control COVID-19 in China without a vaccine?\nThe «Defense of Children's Health» (Children's Defense Fund - CDF), an American NGO, founded in 1973 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., represents the current power struggle in France between the health official and the country's leading virology experts, representing the global fight between government-sponsored (purchased) corporate pharmacies and international organizations, such as the WHO, and renowned scientists. If left open, it is a revelation. See full CDF study.\nFrench professor Didier Raoult, one of the world's top 5 communicable disease scientists, argued that the mass quarantine approach is inefficient and outdated and that large-scale testing and treatment of suspected cases achieve much better results.\nAt first, Dr. Raoult suggested the use of hydroxychloroquine (chloroquine or plaquenyl), a known, simple, and inexpensive drug that is also used to fight malaria, and which has been shown to be effective with previous coronaviruses such as SARS. In mid-February 2020, clinical trials at his institute and in China already confirmed that the drug could reduce viral load and provide dramatic improvement. Chinese scientists published their first trials in more than 100 patients and announced that the Chinese National Health Commission would recommend chloroquine in its new guidelines for treating Covid-19.\nCOVID-19 - The Fight for a Cure: A Giant Western Pharma Scam\nIn addition, China and Cuba are working together with the use of interferon alfa 2B, a highly efficient antiviral drug developed in Cuba some 39 years ago, but little known in the world, due to the embargo imposed by the United States on anything from Cuba. Interferon has also been shown to be very effective in fighting COVID-19 and is now produced in a joint venture in China.\nChinese researchers in cooperation with Cuban scientists are also developing a vaccine that will soon be ready for testing. Unlike the West, which works exclusively for profit, the Sino-Cuban vaccine would be available at low cost to everyone.\nOther simple but effective remedies include the use of large doses of vitamin C, as well as vitamin D3, or more generally the use of essential micronutrients to fight infections, including vitamins A, B, C, D, and E.\nAnother remedy that has been used for thousands of years by the ancient Chinese, Romans, and Egyptians is colloidal silver products. They come in forms to be administered as a liquid orally, or injected, or applied to the skin. Colloidal silver products are stimulating the immune system, fighting bacteria and viruses, and have been used to treat cancer, HIV / AIDS, herpes zoster, herpes, eye diseases, prostatitis and COVID-19 .\nAnother simple and inexpensive remedy, to be used in combination with others, is menthol-based \"Mentholatum\". It is used for common cold and flu symptoms. Rubbed over and around the nose, it acts as a disinfectant and prevents germs from entering the airways.\nNorthern Italy and New Orleans report that an unusual number of patients had to be hospitalized in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and were administered 24 × 7 on a 90% strength respirator, and some of them remained unanswered, with respiratory failure. The reported mortality rate is around 40%. The condition is called acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS. That means the lungs are full of fluid. When applying this description of ARDS episodes, Dr. Raoult and other medical colleagues recommend that COVID-19 patients \"sleep in a sitting position\" until they are cured. This helps drain fluid from the lungs. The method has been known to work successfully since it was first documented during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic.\nUnsurprisingly, if you search for any of these alternative cures on the Internet, the Internet controlled by Google and the Great Corporatocracy, including pharmaceuticals, it will logically advise you not to use them. At best, they will tell you that these products or methods have not been shown to be effective, and at worst, they can be harmful. Don't believe it. None of these products or methods are harmful. Remember, some of them have been used as natural remedies for thousands of years. And remember, China has successfully coped with COVID-19, using some of these relatively simple and inexpensive medications.\nUnfortunately, few doctors are familiar with these practical, simple, and inexpensive remedies. They are safe and most of the time they are not successful. The media, under pressure from pharmaceutical giants and compliant government agencies, have been asked to censor such valuable information. Neglect or failure to make easily accessible remedies public knowledge is killing people.\nNow, let's move on to the persecution, to what is behind everything: behind the extraordinary monstrous propaganda of the media that is bringing down the entire socioeconomic system of the (western) world, creating innumerable miseries, famines and deaths. A misery with suffering potentially orders of magnitude worse than the Great Depression of 1928/1929 and the years after.\nIf anyone had any questions so far, where the virus originated, the truth was surreptitiously revealed, a slip of the tongue or on purpose, by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo when he addressed the Nation on March 21 at COVID-19 He said: \"It is not about retribution, we are in a live exercise here ...\", which means military exercise or a war game.\nPresident Trump next to Pompeo whispered: \"You should have warned us.\" Whatever that means. It is hard to believe that Trump did not know. But these are the vagaries of American politics, even on a serious issue such as the death of the new coronavirus. Watch here with a short video. Check this out too.\nThis live (military) exercise has unimaginable global implications that can completely transform our lives. It is economic war. Almost every country on this planet is under some form of blockade, a kind of quarantine for an as yet undetermined period, with businesses closed, shops and restaurants fired, construction sites stopped, people working from home if they can, being banned in streets, in many countries under police and military surveillance, with cases of people beaten and handcuffed, if they do not have a good explanation.\nFrench police inspired by President Macron is especially known for his uncontrolled brutality in the fight against yellow vests. They have already shown their same contempt for their fellow citizens, when they are on the street, even buying food, without special permission.\nBorders skyrocket, airlines are punished, tourism stops, basically overnight, stranded around the world. With some exceptions, Germany and France are rare, they organize return flights for their citizens abroad. Otherwise, with uncertain flight departures, overloaded and overcrowded flights, stranded tourists hardly have a chance to return home anytime soon.\nThe socioeconomic cost is astronomical. In the multi-quadrillion, or quintillion; numbers with so many zeros that you get dizzy. This calamity can only be valued in part with numbers, and not now, since the blockade of the world continues, with a social cost that cannot be valued. The stock market slump by about 30%, a typical bonanza for forward speculators and Big Finance, Big Banking, with multi-million dollar losses for small investors.\nMillions, if not hundreds of millions of small and medium-sized enterprises went bankrupt, unemployment soared, in the hundreds of millions, worldwide, and the poorest of the poor, especially in developing countries, who are unemployed or survive in small hourly or day-to-day jobs (they have no income, they cannot buy the basics to survive), some may starve, others may commit suicide, others become criminals. This is Greece by a factor of a thousand, or worse.\nThen there is a moral and social collapse of a forced quarantine, for which there is no clear end in sight. This creates fear and anxiety, frustration and anger. For many it is like solitary confinement, all of which is bad for health and reduces the immune defense system. Just what those who handle the threads want.\nSo who does this live (military) exercise serve? - First it would be supposed that it is destined to break the backs of China, since China is the new economic power. Admittedly, China's economy has suffered tremendously, with around 60% to 70% of all production halted during the first two months of this year, the time of the outbreak and the peak of COVID-19, which means a drop significant of China's GDP, perhaps as much as 40% for January and February 2020.\nHowever, China has the coronavirus now firmly under control. And since China is China, its economy is recovering rapidly and will soon return to what it was in December 2019. Indeed, despite the significant impact of COVID-19, China's economy may soon outpace that of the self-styled empire. , United States. States of America China's currency, the yuan, is solidly underpinned by a strong economy and gold, and is slated to become the world's leading reserve currency, replacing the US dollar, which played that role for the past 100 years. years. When that happens, American hegemony is doomed.\nIt's more. This attack on China is actually counterproductive in a big way. China is the supply chain of almost everything to the west. To increase corporate profits, the US USA And other western countries have outsourced almost everything to China with low-cost labor. This concerns not only high-tech electronics, but also medicines and medical equipment. About 80% and the ingredients for producing medicines come from China. For antibiotics, the ratio is approximately 90%.\nWith much of Chinese production halted for almost 2 months, the delay in delivery is huge.\nA plan has been on the board for the past few years, dictated by the Dark Clan, or \"Deep Dark State,\" and designed by his minions, who hope to be handsomely rewarded in one way or another. Or, you can put it this way, the absence of punishment and torture is also a form of reward.\nUniversal vaccination\nFirst, there is a huge push towards universal vaccination, because vaccination will be the cornerstone of all that follows, that is, a universally imposed electronic identification of every person on the planet. And what is the most appropriate to force a vaccination program? - A pandemic, of course, with more and more scared people. The fear factor is key. It is increasing by an undetermined quarantine over time and by constant dripping indoctrination of bad news on the COVID-19 front. Every day, the pace of an increasing number of infected people and those who died accelerates, increasing fear and anxiety.\nThe time will come, when people will literally scream for help. They want a police and military state to protect them from the virus, I suppose, and they want to be vaccinated. They don't care or ask what cocktail is injected into their body and what their long-term implications may be. For example, the vaccination cocktail could serve to reduce the fertility of men and women, or cause long-term neurological defects that can even be passed on to future generations. People with fear just want to sleep peacefully, getting vaccinated. They do not care, nor do they want to know, that together with the vaccine, a nanochip could be injected that will contain all their personal data, from health records to bank accounts, and can be electronically controlled remotely.\nIt goes without saying that our monetary system is planned to be fully electronic, no more effective, cash is poison, or as the WHO Director-General recently warned, not literally, but with that meaning, cash is dangerous for infections. , paper money and coins can carry deadly viruses, thus paving the way for the complete digitization of our monetary system. In fact, this has already been proven in recent years, mainly in Scandinavian countries, where department stores refuse to accept cash. In response to the recommendation of the WHO DG, some shops and restaurants in Germany refuse to accept cash.\nUniversal vaccine and electronic identification go together and will be tested first in some developing countries. Bangladesh is one of them. The vaccination program is the platform for the mega changes that the New World Order (NOW) or the One World Order (OWO) wants to achieve. This, in addition to the enormous bonanza to make money.\nAn almost unknown agency called Agenda ID2020 is behind all of this, monitoring, directing and fine-tuning the implementation of the various programs, which are supposed to eventually lead to the Full Spectrum Domain. For more details, see also the recent article on the dangers of the ID2020 Agenda.\nBehind this complex and complex web of things, a prominent name appears again and again: Bill Gates, the Bill Foundation and Melinda Gate. Bill Gates has been funding vaccination programs in Africa for decades. And Bill Gates and the Rockefellers do not hide that one of their main goals for planet Earth is a drastic reduction in population.\nSummary of the ID2020 Agenda\nID2020 Agenda: It is an alliance of public-private partners, including United Nations agencies and civil society. It is an electronic identification program that uses widespread vaccination as a platform for digital identity. The program leverages existing birth registration and vaccination operations to provide newborns with a persistent, biometrically linked digital digital identity.\nGAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, identifies itself on its website as a global health association of public and private sector organizations dedicated to \"immunization for all.\" GAVI is supported by the WHO, and it goes without saying that its main partners and sponsors are the pharmaceutical industry.\nThe ID2020 Alliance at its 2019 Summit, titled 'Rising to the Good Identification Challenge', in September 2019 in New York, decided to implement its program in 2020, a decision confirmed by the FEM in January 2020 in Davos. Your digital identity program will be tested with the government of Bangladesh. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and \"partners in academia and humanitarian aid\" (as they call it), are part of the pioneering party.\nIs it just a coincidence that ID2020 is being implemented at the beginning of what WHO calls a pandemic? - Or is a pandemic needed to \"roll out\" the multiple devastating ID2020 programs?\nHow Vaccination Research and Production is supposed to work.\nHow will this complex and complex business of creating vaccines and implementing vaccination campaigns work? Since most official activities that are basically government responsibilities are privatized and subcontracted, they become complex, chaotic at times, and inefficient. In the case of the West, EE. USA He pretends to take the initiative, but will also assign responsibilities to European pharmaceutical laboratories.\nThe National Institute of Health (NIH) has overall responsibility for national health research and program implementation. The NIH director is Anthony Fauci. The Institute was created in 1955. Under the NIH, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), one of 27 institutes, which reports to the NIH, is responsible for vaccination programs. NIAD's mission is to conduct basic and applied research to better understand, treat and prevent infectious, immunological and allergic diseases. NIAD has outsourced the vaccination program to the Coalition for Outbreak Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).\nCEPI was formed by the WEF (World Economic Forum) in Davos in January 2017. It was founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the London-based Welcome Trust, created in 1936, but which now includes as members various European countries. and the European Union (EU). The BMGF made a first infusion to CEPI of US $ 460 million. CEPI also receives funds from Norway and India and also has strong support from the pharmaceutical industry.\nAccording to the CEPI website, CEPI has requested $ 2 billion to support the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 and expand the number of vaccine candidates to increase the chances of success and to fund clinical trials for these candidate vaccines. CEPI's ambition is to have at least three candidate vaccines, which could be submitted to regulatory authorities for licenses for general use / outbreak use.\n“Governments around the world will need to invest billions of euros more in the development of the coronavirus vaccine to move forward with some promising candidates that are emerging. - It is a very risky business: everything is being done in parallel, not taking advantage of the experience of others, but great progress is being made, \"said Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at CEPI.\nCEPI already has some shortlisted international pharmaceutical corporations to research and work on a COVID-19 vaccine. They include \"Modern\" biotechnology in Seattle, not far from Microsoft headquarters, also a brainchild of Bill Gates; the Inovio biotechnology laboratory, the University of Queensland, Australia, and the Germans, BioNTech and CureVac.\nFrom the outset, it appears that Moderna, CureVac and BioNTech are best suited to produce a rapid vaccine, because according to a Health and Science report published on March 17, 2020, \"these three companies specialize in messenger RNA therapies ( MRNA). These mRNA molecules are used to signal the body to produce its own immune response to fight a variety of different diseases. This type of vaccine can potentially develop and be produced more quickly than traditional vaccines. \"\nCOVID-19 - The Fight for a Cure: One Gigantic Western Pharma Rip-OffEnters GAVI - The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization has also been created by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is a global health association of public and private sector organizations dedicated to \"immunization for all.\" GAVI is supported by the WHO, and it goes without saying that its main partners and sponsors are the pharmaceutical industry. GAVI has already announced that it needs billions of dollars to support its COVID-19 vaccination program. In June 2020, the UK Government will sponsor a donor conference in support of GAVI's COVID-19 vaccination program, with the expectation of raising $ 7.3 billion.\nFrom this maze of overlapping organizations, unclear activities and responsibilities, the flow of money is likely to be a crossover that no one can follow. Large-scale responsibility will be lost.\nAs for production, hopefully one vaccine, or several vaccines. For the layman and the potential patient, it will be a matter of luck (or bad luck) which cocktail of biological substances will be injected into their body. In any case, the long-term result is unpredictable. Remember, Bill Gates has been chasing his own very special agenda for the past fifteen or twenty years. It is unlikely to leave him now. Rather, COVID-19 and the resulting vaccination program will allow you to improve it.\nIn conclusion: it is widely clear that this is a great proposal to make money and public scam by the pharmaceutical industry. What makes this multi-billion dollar scam even worse is that it has an official rubber stamp, being supported by Western governments and international organizations, primarily WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank.\nThis may be the last chance for the elite, 0.1%, to mix social capital and worker-financed assets from the bottom up, before entering an era of full control through electromagnetic fields (EMF),\nSource In videos-The Russian response team against COVID-19 moves to Bergamo from the Pratica di Mare air base"}, {"url": "https://www.zamainfo.net/%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A6%D8%A9/%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B4%D9%8A/", "title": "Russian politician: the United States behind the outbreak of \"Corona\" virus", "text": "The leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, accused the United States of being behind the spread of the new \"Corona\" virus across the world.\nHe asked, “Is it really a new type of influenza?

On 30 January, he declared the virus an international emergency, but made clear that there was no reason for countries to issue travel-advisories against travelling to China. Let me speculate – the ‘international emergency’ was declared at the request of Washington, and the comment against the travel-advisory was an addition by Dr. Tedros himself, as he realized that there was indeed no reason for panic, that China is doing wonders in stemming the virus from spreading and in detecting the virus early on.\nIn fact, Dr. Tedros has himself, as well as other high-ranking WHO officials, on various occasions praised China for her effort to contain the virus, the speed with which Wuhan (population of 11 million, capital of the center-eastern Province of Hubei) and China as a whole has reacted to the outbreak. The latest achievement – in 8 days China has built in Wuhan a 25,000 m2 special hospital for treatment of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV and possible mutations, with 1,000 beds, and for about 1,400 medical personnel, for a budget of the equivalent of US$ 43 million – equipped with state-of-the-art medical technology. No other country in the world would have been capable of such an achievement.\nNevertheless, and against WHO’s guidance, Washington immediately advised its citizens not to travel to China, and withdrew non-essential staff from US consulates and the Embassy in Beijing, thereby triggering an avalanche of similar reactions among Washington vassals around the globe – i.e. most of the European countries did likewise, many of them canceled their flights to China, as did of course the US. For some reasons I have yet to understand, Russia closed her 4,200 km long border with China. Would Russia fall to the western panic-mongering propaganda hype? – Hard to believe. But then what is the reason?\nThe NYT and WashPo are on a vicious daily campaign to slander and vilify China with lies and manipulated information on how badly China is managing the disease, when the complete opposite is the case. Compare this to the common flu epidemic, that hits the US and most of the western countries, despite the fact that the US and Europe have virtually implemented carpet vaccination (in some US States and EU countries even compulsory).\nYet, this 2019 / 2020 flu season which is far from over, has so far claimed more than 8,400 lives alone in the US, more than 140,000 hospitalizations and more than 8 million infected people. The US has about 330 million people. Compare this to China’s 1.4 billion population – with, as of 3 February, an infection rate of less than 21,000, a death toll of 425 in China, and outside of China reported two, one in Hong Kong, another one in the Philippines.\nExpand these statistics to Europe and you find similar figures. Of course, nobody talks about it. This is an annual occurrence – a bonanza for the western pharma industry. In the west, disease is business. The more the merrier. Once you are in the “medical mill”, it’s difficult to escape. “Specialists’ find always another reason to send you yet to another “specialist” – for another treatment. The ignorant patient has no option than to obey – after all its his health and life. In China it is the total opposite. The Chinese system does everything for its population’s health and well-being.\nYet, China bashing in one way or another seems to intensify by the day. Yesterday, 3 February, the UN in Geneva has issued an edict that all UN employees returning from China must stay home and work from home for 14 days, i.e. a dictated self-quarantine. And new contracts for Chinese staff will be temporarily suspended. This is all propaganda against China.\nQuarantine is absolutely not necessary. Chinese biologists of the Office of Science and Technology of the city of Wuxi (south-eastern Jiangsu province, near Shanghai) have developed a test kit that can detect the 2019-nCoV virus within 8 – 15 minutes, similar to a pregnancy test. This test kit is available to the world. In fact, it has been used to test an airline crew member arriving from New York at the Zurich airport and feeling ill. Within less than an hour, the crew member was sent home – it was the common flu.\nIn China, where by now scientific evidence is mounting that the disease – like all the coronaviral diseases, including the 2019-nCoV predecessor SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 2002 / 2003 also in China), and its Middle East equivalent, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) are not only laboratory fabricated, but also patented. And so are many others, for example, Ebola and HIV. Both, SARS and 2019-nCoV are not only man-made, but they are also focusing on the Chinese race. That’s why you find very few people infected in the 18 countries where the coronavirus has spread.\nIt sounds like a strange coincidence that in October 2019 a simulation with precisely the coronavirus was carried out at the John Hopkins Institute in the US, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the WEF (World Economic Forum), as well as the Pirbright Institute of the UK, one of the world’s few level 4 (highest security level) bio-warfare laboratories.\nThe west’s ‘demolition’ priority seems to have shifted drastically from Russia to China. Why? – Because China is an ever-stronger economic power, soon to surpass the United States in absolute terms. Since mid-2017, China is already number one, measured by the PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) indicator, indeed the most important one, because it demonstrates what people can actually buy with the money.\nChina’s currency, the Yuan, is also advancing rapidly as a reserve currency, gradually replacing the US-dollar. When that happens, that real money, like the Chinese Yuan, based on a hard economy and covered by gold, against a “fake” fiat currency (based on nothing), like the US-dollar, is taking the lead, then the US-dollar hegemony is broken and the US economy doomed.\nTo prevent that from happening Washington is doing everything possible to destabilize China – see Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Uyghurs in China’s western Xinjiang Province, Tibet, the infamous Trump-inspired “tariff war” – and now the new coronavirus outbreak. The death toll is at present about 2.1% (of total cases of infection), down from 2.3% a week ago.\nBut that and the constant bashing with negative western propaganda, travel bans, border closures, flight bans – and more – plus the disease itself, the medical care, work absenteeism, medication and medical equipment, not to forget the specially-built 1,000-bed emergency hospital in Wuhan – and an 8% average decline at the Shanghai stock exchange, bear a considerable economic cost for China. So much so, that the People’s Bank of China (PBC) has recently injected some 1.2 billion yuan (about US$ 174 million equivalent) into the economy.\nThis new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, may just be a trial. Imagine a stronger mutation of a coronavirus would be implanted into the Chinese population, say with a mortality rate of 10% to 20% or higher – it could cause real havoc. However, a stronger version may not be so easily controllable and directable – i.e. towards the Chinese race – and may risk spreading to the Caucasian race as well – meaning the executioner would risk committing mass suicide.\nRemember the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the deadliest in history, infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide – at that time about one-third of the planet’s population – and killed at least 50 million people (a death rate of 10%), including some 700,000 Americans.\nWhile preparing for the worst, because Washington – with the help of its level 4 bio-war lab – will not let go easily, China’s approach of endless inventive creation, avoiding conflicts, will outlive the aggressor.\nPeter Koenig is an economist and geopolitical analyst.

Written by: Dr. I will be back, I will be back\n# Ambassador\nThis virus, which has spread to a superpower, is striking; China, which the United States fears militarily and economically and has dubbed it in its political literature as a “sleeping dragon”, is a country in which China’s experts and experts recommend that “do not awaken the dragon”.\nIt is not the habit of the United States of America to leave its opponents and those who threaten its security in peace, evidence and evidence, many of which are the American containment strategy for communism during the Cold War, and the Soviet Union also America's opponent that was the cause of its collapse in 1991 AD, as well as the countries of the Middle East region that threaten the security of Israel - just from their point of view. What their literature admits - beginning with Iraq and accusing it of an American of possessing weapons of mass destruction was the invasion of 2003 AD, and what was witnessed by Syria is the strong country that Israel fears, so it was in 2011 AD and the beginning of a global war against Syria to destroy it and break up its forces, and Iran is another example in which America considers guiding To her and her allies are the sources of American exploitation, so Iran's accusation of its nuclear project was pretended that it was militarized, not peaceful, and much much, and the result is that throughout the history of the United States of America, no country or country or force of forces reached a high level of development and progress unless and tried to destroy it in a manner through the method through Its military, security, and intelligence institutions and its scientific research centers. From this fact, my article came to create a mathematical theory in which there is imposition and demand and then proof.\nBased on the foregoing, the hypothesis of this article states the following: “The rise of China economically and militarily, and its formation as an ally of the Russian Federation and the heir to the Soviet Union in addition to North Korea in the first place and the countries of the resistance axis, China threatens US national security in one way or another, and therefore must - According to the American intelligence mentality - from striking a blow that weakens its power to China and causes its overall level of development to decline, in order to keep the gap between China and America widening and far, until the ghosts of fears of the \"sleeping dragon\" are extinct. This hypothesis needs to be investigated in order for us to prove it or deny it.\nFirst, it is necessary to include a list of the most important rumors about Kona virus and the standing behind it, such as the following:\nFirst: The Russian media narrative focuses on one point repeatedly, which is that western political elites, especially American ones, are behind this epidemic.\nSecond: The first Russian government channel, one of the most prominent TV channels, is to allocate a fixed paragraph to address the \"Western conspiracy\" about the Corona virus, in the evening news program \"Time\".\nThird: Officially, China accuses America of being behind the Coruna virus and vowing to wipe Washington from the face of the earth, quoting Egypt's network now.\nIn tandem with the above, there is a question that presents itself: What are the data that suggested that the spread of Corona virus in China is a planned or a conspiracy?\nFirst: The Evidence: Russia's Submission that Corona is an ethnic biological weapon that states use against hostile peoples. One of the Russian experts during the report is that the Chinese Corona virus (“synthetic creature”), and that the pharmaceutical companies are behind this, historically known to be the United States The American was running a laboratory in Georgia, where she was testing biological weapons on humans.\nSecond, the logical evidence: the spread of Corona virus in China came at a time when China was preparing to literally invade the world with technology, industry and the terrible Chinese economy.\nAs a result, this evidence is insufficient and not convincing, but the Western, especially the American, is the biggest beneficiary, in countries that do not believe that what is happening from the epidemic is divine punishment, but rather mocks and employs this media and political, and I, as a researcher, build an opinion on the basis of the beneficiary, especially since its history is full With many such events, experiences and evidence, the most important of which is for human experimentation. Example: First: The Guatemala Project is just one of many gruesome experiments carried out in the name of medicine.\nSecond, US military doctors in the Philippines have infected five people with bubonic plague, and wounded 29 prisoners by land.\nThird: In the 1950s, in order to simulate a biological warfare attack, the US Navy sprayed large amounts of wilted Siratian bacteria - which were considered harmless at this time - over San Francisco during a project called Operation Sea Mist. Many citizens developed pneumonia-like illnesses, and at least one person died as a result.\nFourth: The San Francisco Chronicle, on December 17, 1979, wrote page 5 about the Church’s scientific claim that the CIA conducted a biological warfare experiment in the open air in 1955 near Tampa, Florida and other areas in Florida with pertussis bacteria. She claimed that the experience increased the number of whooping cough injuries by three times in Florida and injured more than a thousand cases, and this caused an increase in deaths due to whooping cough in the country from one to 12 over the previous year.\nFifth: In 1966, the US Army released Bacillus globuli to the New York City subway system as part of a field study called The Affliction of Subway Passengers in New York City Undercover Attack with Biological Agents. The Chicago subway system also underwent a similar experience by the military. There are experiences of atomic radiation and radioactive contamination.\nAnd based on these facts documented historically, I built my belief that the United States of America had planned to spread the Corona virus in China as a biological warfare that relieved it from moving any inhabitants, and its profits were invaluable at various levels.\nEven at the level of countries, there are doubts from some countries that Western countries, especially the American ones, are behind this spread of this virus in China. Here is the question: Why are their goals? What is their interest? What will America gain from weakening China?\nIn fact, the American interest lies in the same goals, namely the weakening of the Chinese economy and then the weakening of the geopolitical competitor, and here it must be noted the fallacy that: “The goal of pharmaceutical companies is to achieve huge profits from vaccines against the virus.” So far, no Western party has claimed that it has treatment, but rather internal Chinese entities affiliated with the Chinese state itself. In the event that it happened and monopolized the drug in an agent abroad, but this did not happen so I called it a fallacy, launched by the friends of China.\nIn the context of the talk, the interest of the outside to weaken China has already affected it, and the manifestations of the effect of the spread of the virus on the reality and future of China, such as countries withdrawing their citizens from China, and cutting land, sea and air flights, from the closest friends to the enemies, such as Russia reducing flights and trains to China. Likewise, Iran, which reflects negatively on the Chinese economy, which disturbs the progress and development of the American competitor and his intelligence services.\nAs for the most important question, which is, what will America gain from weakening China if it is proven by the definitive evidence - that it is from me who is behind the Corna virus? The answer is as follows:\nFirst: To limit the development of Chinese military power, which, in the nature of nature, will not be able to compete with the American military force.\nSecondly, China discouraged its political stances, especially in the outstanding issues between it and America, such as the position on the Taiwan issue, and China's support for the Iranian nuclear agreement. China also rejects the idea of American domination of world affairs.\nThird: The impact on the Chinese human power, as China is the first global force in terms of human wealth, with a population of about one billion and 300 million people. China has managed, with its management of its human wealth, to achieve huge economic progress and build a military force that is the largest in the world.\nFourth: A direct blow to the human development process in China, according to (researcher Mahmoud Mohamed in his message “Dimensions of the Chinese Rise in the International System and its Repercussions 1991-2010), the Chinese government paid attention to the health of its residents. In 2006, health spending reached 3.6% of The size of the gross domestic product, and the percentage of those enrolled in basic and university education reached 70% of the total population, while the literacy rate for those over fifteen was 90.9%.\nFifth: Directing a severe blow to the development process in general Development in China has focused on three determinants: agricultural development, industrial progress, scientific and technological development. China has paid great attention to scientific and technological research so that it can achieve its aspirations and aspirations for all purposes.\nIn this regard, it must be pointed out what proves the American move against China and its necessity, namely, the strategy of containing China, which was clearly shown in an orderly manner by Condoleezza Rice since the beginning of her work as a national security advisor when she announced that China, as a growing and ambitious force, poses a challenge to vital American interests. In the Asia and other regions of the world for these reasons, Rice has called for more US support for India to maintain regional balance in Asia.\nThe result: The work to spread the Corona virus and amplify its negative effects on China is part of an American plan to hit China economically, militarily and culturally within the framework of what is today called the wars of the fourth and fifth generations; which are based on creating crises and spreading epidemics and diseases under the framework of biological wars, sowing discord and rumors The demolition of values and heritage, the demolition of society in general, and the final move away from the direct clash method, and this result has become clear and proven in light of the historical evidence of the American biological experiments, and for the American dealings with the competitors and the rising powers as well, and on this basis and by returning to the imposition In my article, the Corona virus is a form of an American strike against China in order to weaken its power and cause its level of development in general to keep the gap between China and America widening and far, until the ghosts of fears of the \"sleeping dragon\" disappear.\n# Severbers _ By: Dr. I will be back, I will be back"}, {"url": "https://syrianownews.com/404", "title": "Sorry, the page does not exist", "text": "https://syrianownews.com/404\nSorry, the page does not exist\nSorry ... the page you requested does not exist\nPlease make sure the link is correct or search the site"}, {"url": "https://www.alsumaria.tv/news/%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA/338484/%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B2-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D8%AF%D8%AF-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3", "title": "Corona's puzzle ... an exciting report that renews \"conspiracy theory\": the virus was created 5 years ago", "text": "This controversy escalated, especially between the United States and China, to the highest levels, as US President Donald Trump described it as a Chinese virus, while Beijing suspected that he was an American.\nAlthough scientists and specialists are now busy combating this deadly epidemic, regardless of its source, and some confirm that there are no indications of its creation and that it is a \"natural\" virus known to \"lineage\", it was exposed to a mutation that turned it into a \"killer\" that has the ability to penetrate human cells, except A report published by the American journal, Nature, known for its sobriety, still threw more oil on \"conspiracy theory\" oil.\nThis report was published on November 12, 2015, and reported that US scientists have created in the laboratory a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats in connection with a virus that causes SARS, that is, acute respiratory syndrome.\nThe magazine revealed about 5 years ago that scientists had examined a virus called \"SHC014\", which was found in horseshoe bats in China.\nThese scientists combined the surface protein of \"SHC014\" with the SARS virus, and came out with a new virus that provided the surface protein with a structure that helps it penetrate into the cells of the human respiratory system.

It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\nResearchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than previously thought.\"\nOn the other hand, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify \"potential risks\".\nSimon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: \"If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.\"\nIn October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on \"job promotion\", especially those that cause serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans."}, {"url": "http://www.khabr.online/2020/04/covid-19.html", "title": "New conspiracy theory: Is Bill Gates behind the genesis and spread of COVID-19 SK?", "text": "New conspiracy theory: Is Bill Gates behind the genesis and spread of COVID-19 SK?\nStone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM waves, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: \"Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate.\"\nHe added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to sow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations.\nAccording to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is linked to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain \"mandatory vaccinations.\"\nStone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations.\nGates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis such as coronaviruses, to the extent of recent talk about Gates's prediction of the disease 3 years ago.\nAs the Washington Times reported, Gates announced earlier this month that his charitable organization would invest billions of dollars in factories that would focus on developing many vaccines.\nSource: New York Post"}, {"url": "https://www.rt.com/news/484593-disinformation-russian-aid-italy-covid/", "title": "How disinformation really works: Activists linked to pro-NATO think tank smear Russian Covid-19 aid to Italy", "text": "Here's what happened. The weekend before last, Vladimir Putin called Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. During the conversation, Conte asked for help, in fighting coronavirus, according to the Kremlin readout which hasn't been contradicted by Italian officials.\nLet's be clear from the outset, there was undoubtably a strong PR, as well as practical, element to Russia's assistance. However, there were also advantages to Rome from this approach, as the move may have helped to concentrate a few minds among its traditional allies.\nMoscow sent teams of \"doctors, protective gear and medical equipment\" to the stricken country. The detail included 100 military virologists and epidemiologists, along with eight medical teams, according to Russian news outlets. Most importantly, it delivered 600 ventilators.\nA significant amount given Italy apparently had only about 5,000 of the devices. Indeed, a few days after the Putin/Conte call, the New York Times was writing about Italy's \"ventilator crisis.\"\nThere's usually nothing like a bit of Russian influence to jolt EU and NATO elites into action. As mentioned above, no doubt this was also part of Conte's reasoning. That said, it's also worth mentioning that some other Europeans states have tried to help the Italians. Germany and France, in particular, took patients and sent supplies, despite dealing with outbreaks of their own. Yet, many in Italy feel they haven't done enough.\nPutin was also surely thinking ahead to a post-coronavirus crisis time when Italians will remember who stood by them in their hour of need. Especially given Italy is now the third most powerful country in a European Union which has Russia under sanctions.\nIndeed as the Diplomatic Editor of BBC’s newsnight, Mark Urban, noted “Russia and China have sent help to Italy. You might argue it’s not huge in scale and given for political reasons. But when Italians remember this crisis and wonder what the US did for them at this hour of need…”\nRussia and China have sent help to Italy.

The first I saw of it was a tweet from Oliver Carroll, of London’s Independent newspaper, who presumably speaks Italian (I don’t, so I am relying on his translation).\n“Some Italians are expressing unease about Putin's Covid-19 emergency aid,” he wrote. “Acc(ording) to La Stampa, 80 percent of supplies (are) “useless,\" (and) sources worry about high-ranking military officers now in (the) country. Russian soldiers (are) free to roam (in) Italy a few steps away from NATO,” the paper stated.\nSome Italians are expressing unease about Putin's Covid-19 emergency aid.

Thus, we have to take the author's word for it.\nHowever, the same day, Italy’s Ambassador to Moscow had a rather different point-of-view. “Pasquale Terracciano thanked Russia for its assistance in the fight against novel coronavirus, adding that the humanitarian aid to his country included about 600 medical ventilators,” reported the TASS news agency. It then quoted Terracciano as saying \"it is very important that all this medical equipment includes 600 ventilators, which are critically important at this stage of the epidemic.\"\nMeanwhile, the President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, openly dismissed La Stampa’s report. \"I say thanks to the Russians who sent us doctors and other people who can help with disinfection,\" he told an online press conference. Lombardy is the Italian region most affect by the Covid-19 crisis.\n“The Russian Federation has sent face masks, ventilators and medical staff and teams to disinfect public buildings and our cities,” Italian Foreign Minister Di Maio said. “They have helped in their own way in an act of solidarity.”\nAs you can see, those entitled to speak for Italy seem to be pretty grateful for Moscow's aid. Nevertheless, predictably, 'Atlanticists' weren't happy. Despite the fact that Trump's America has been about as useful to Europe in this emergency as a wetsuit in the desert.\nThe president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, also dismisses @Lastampa's report. \"I say thanks to the Russians who sent us doctors and other people who can help with disinfection,\" he told an online press conference. https://t.co/5EG3PkvZT3\nThe president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, also dismisses @Lastampa's report. \"I say thanks to the Russians who sent us doctors and other people who can help with disinfection,\" he told an online press conference. https://t.co/5EG3PkvZT3 — Bryan MacDonald (@27khv) March 26, 2020\nEto Buziashvili of NATO's Atlantic Council adjunct wrote on Twitter that \"80% of the Covid-19 supplies supplies that Russia has sent to Italy are useless,\" citing La Stampa. Her Twitter biography, by the way, claims she's an expert in 'disinformation.'\nNext up was Olga Tokariuk, who writes for Atlantic Council as well as a Kiev-based news site, Hromadske, which is bankrolled by the local US embassy. \"According to La Stampa sources in the Italian military, 80% of items they [the Russians] brought are useless,\" she tweeted.

But hey, at least the Russian military turned up: https://t.co/Sbw6xBYoB2 — Michael Weiss (@michaeldweiss) March 28, 2020\nWhat's most interesting here the fact that so many of the people pushing the disinformation are connected to the pro-NATO pressure group. Not to mention the fact that they used almost the same form of words. Was this coordination, or coincidence?\nCircling back to the original La Stampa piece, it seemed logical to check whether the reporter had any think tank links himself. Not surprisingly, it turns out Jacopo Iacoboni has also written for the Atlantic Council. He most notably assisted Alina Polyakova with a 2017 report dubbed 'The Kremlin's Trojan Horses.' This hit job smeared numerous Italian public figures — such as politician's Beppe Grillo and Matteo Salvini — as effectively operating as proxies for Moscow.\nPolyakova has since been appointed to run CEPA, a lobby firm, masquerading as a think tank. It's raison d'être to promote NATO's role in Eastern Europe. To this end, it's funded by American and British weapons manufacturers which have profited from the US-led alliance's expansion.\nIt turns out Iacoboni's anti-Russia credentials are quite well known. Indeed, they have even been endorsed by the Intregity Initiative. In case you have forgotten, this was a British government funded undercover \"information wars\" effort which didn't stay secret for very long.The Integrity Initiative included him in its list of people in particular countries its organizers felt they could use to run anti-Russian coverage. This is not to imply Iacoboni knew he was he being considered by the British for such operations, but it does mean they regarded him as reliably anti-Russian. Which tells its own tale.\nThe La Stampa story, based on anonymous sources, which may or may not be legitimate, was a curious intervention at a time when Italy is on its knees. It's quite instructive that the think tank crowd, most notably those from Atlantic Council who rarely show any interest in Italian affairs, jumped on it. As is the author's own association with the pro-NATO institution. Make of it what you will.\nLike this story?

This is stated in a statement published on the website of the Russian Foreign Ministry.\n“Russia has consistently opposed the use of unilateral restrictions, which run counter to international law and cause significant damage to the socio-economic development of states. We presume that in the context of the rapid spread of infection, the question of removing such barriers is of particular relevance, including with a view to providing the countries affected by the restrictions with the necessary medical supplies, ”the diplomatic department notes.\nThe Foreign Ministry also believes that international restrictions imposed earlier by the UN Security Council should not be a \"brake on the fight against a pandemic.\"\n“Sanctions regimes of the Security Council provide for exceptions and exceptions of a humanitarian nature. It is necessary that these safety mechanisms work smoothly and do not fail due to the politicized installations of individual states, ”the department noted.\nEarlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin came up with the initiative to lift sanctions against COVID-19-affected countries at the G20 virtual summit. He proposed the creation of “green corridors”, free from trade wars and restrictive measures, for the mutual supply of medicines, food, equipment and technology.\n“In this regard, the head of the Russian state voiced the idea of introducing a joint moratorium on restrictions on essential goods, as well as on financial transactions for their purchases,” the Russian Foreign Ministry notes.\nA few days before the G20 summit, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, in his letter, urged G20 leaders to lift sanctions that impede the supply of food and medical supplies amid the spread of coronavirus. He also emphasized that in this situation, states should be in solidarity with each other.\nAn urgent review of sectoral sanctions against countries facing the COVID-19 problem was also called on by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet. She noted that restriction could have disastrous consequences for the health system and a violation of human rights.\n“In the context of a global pandemic, barriers to medical care in one country only increase the risk for each of us,” she said in a message posted on the UN website.\nRecall that the outbreak of COVID-19 was recorded in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of December 2019. Currently, outside of China, the disease has been reported in patients in more than 190 countries. On March 11, the World Health Organization announced the coronavirus pandemic. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, as of March 28, a total of more than 600 thousand people had the disease confirmed, more than 28 thousand people had died. The United States came to first place in the world in the number of cases, more than 100 thousand cases of infection were detected there. In Europe, Italy remains the leader in terms of the number of infected people (about 86 thousand cases), followed by Spain (over 72 thousand), Germany (more than 53 thousand) and France (about 33 thousand).\nAccording to experts, in such an extremely unfavorable epidemiological situation, all countries of the world should come to the realization of the need to lift unilateral sanctions.\n“It is very important to remove restrictions in a situation of such a global challenge as coronavirus, when it is necessary to create maximum conditions for protecting the population of certain countries,” Vladimir Shapovalov, deputy director of the Institute of History and Politics of the Moscow State Pedagogical University, emphasized in an interview with RT.\n“It is very important to remove restrictions in a situation of such a global challenge as coronavirus, when it is necessary to create maximum conditions for protecting the population of certain countries,” Vladimir Shapovalov, deputy director of the Institute of History and Politics of the Moscow State Pedagogical University, emphasized in an interview with RT.\nHe called the call of the international community justified, because every day sanctions against certain countries \"take a large number of lives in a pandemic.\"\nPolitical analyst Alexander Asafov, in turn, noted in a conversation with RT that the “introduction of green corridors” that Vladimir Putin spoke about could “significantly help” countries in the fight against COVID-19.\nAt the same time, as analysts note, the call to lift sanctions restrictions is aimed primarily at the United States and other Western countries.\nThus, according to the head of the Federal Bundestag Committee on Economics and Energy Klaus Ernst, the sanctions policy of Washington against the backdrop of a pandemic is unacceptable.\n“Instead of negotiating mutual compromises and thus contributing to the peaceful world community, the US is trying through a policy of sanctions to impose its will unilaterally on others and put them at a disadvantage in favor of the US economy,” Ernst told RIA Novosti, commenting on the situation. around possible new measures against Russia.\nWe will remind, earlier the American newspaper The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House is considering introducing sanctions restrictions against the Russian Federation in order to achieve \"stabilization of oil prices.\"\nIn addition, according to Ernst, Washington’s attempts to impose its interests unilaterally for the sake of economic benefit are “irresponsible and take away lives”, in particular in Iran and Syria, which suffer from a shortage of medical supplies, including drugs, due to restrictions.\n“The lifting of sanctions, and not their extension, is what is required at the moment. And I really hope that the German government and the rest of the EU will come to realize this fact, ”said the head of the Bundestag committee.\nRussia previously also called on the United States to abandon sanctions against Iran amid the situation with COVID-19. This was stated by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov. According to him, Washington realizes that its policy seriously limits Tehran’s ability to combat the coronavirus, but ignores this in pursuit of its geopolitical goals.\nRecall, on March 20, the Iranian representative to the UN said that the country's efforts \"to identify cases of infection and treat patients, as well as effectively prevent the spread of the virus are blocked by American economic and medical terrorism and sanctions.\"\n“By limiting our ability to prevent the further spread of coronavirus (including to other countries), inhumane and illegal US sanctions harm the health and lives of citizens of both Iran and other countries. In other words, while the United States is trying to keep the virus at home, it also contributes to its spread in the rest of the world, limiting the capabilities of professionals in specific countries affected by the virus, who are trying to fight a pandemic in their country, ”the document says.\nIt is worth noting that the United States, despite the pandemic, continues to expand sanctions restrictions, in particular against Russia, Iran, Syria and Iraq.\nAccording to Vladimir Shapovalov, the sanctions of the United States and its allies “flagrantly violate” the UN Charter and the norms of the World Trade Organization.\n“But the United States and other Western states are members of the UN Security Council and the WTO. A large number of deaths from coronavirus are already on the conscience of Western countries, since the sanctions regime creates serious barriers to the provision of medical care and the purchase of necessary medicines. At the same time, Washington artificially creates a situation of humanitarian catastrophe, and its allies follow this fairway, ”the expert said.\n“But the United States and other Western states are members of the UN Security Council and the WTO.

Moreover, the US will try to use this pandemic situation to deliver even more blows to countries under their pressure, because in this situation they are in a vulnerable position, ”the analyst said.\nAlexander Asafov also believes that, despite the need to unite countries around the world to face new challenges, the United States and its allies are not ready to take such a step.\n“They do not want to change the logic of their foreign policy, to give up economic pressure. Let me remind you of the attitude of the American side as a whole towards the UN, including regular threats from Washington on the cessation of this organization. The call to lift unilateral sanctions will also not be heard. On the contrary, the Americans are intensifying their pressure on their opponents by means of restriction, using various reasons for this, including the same coronavirus infection, ”the expert said.\nAnalysts also agree that with their aggressive actions in the context of the spread of the coronavirus, Washington and its allies \"threaten the security of the whole world.\"\n“After all, the virus knows no boundaries, and the situation in one country can directly affect the state of affairs in another. Moreover, Western states led by the United States risk the lives of their own citizens, but this does not stop them - a cynical policy takes over for the sake of realizing their own goals and strengthening their positions, ”Shapovalov concluded.\n“After all, the virus knows no boundaries, and the situation in one country can directly affect the state of affairs in another.

In the article: The vast majority of European countries were forced to take emergency measures to combat the Corona virus . Governments restrict citizens ’freedom of movement and freedom of assembly and cancel elections.\nFrequently, the recess of parliamentary debates is resorted to. A clear example is the European Parliament, where all non-crisis debates have been postponed indefinitely. Another frightening trend is widespread application of emergency procedures and martial law, which breaks the backbone of existing systems of separation of powers.\nThe epidemic also gives authoritarian leaders the opportunity to control the country and benefit from unconditional population support. Moreover, if the infection threatens politicians, parliaments often become less effective. This is evident in the United States, where the Republican Party lost the majority in the Senate due to the quarantine of five Republicans. As a result, the emergency measures bill to deal with the consequences of the epidemic continued for several more days.\nTo avoid such situations, countries with particularly difficult epidemiological conditions are taking measures that were previously considered dangerous and unacceptable to doing business. Parliaments are actively working to introduce remote voting systems. In Canada, Parliament was generally closed for five weeks. Moreover, as practice shows, totalitarian regimes demonstrate greater effectiveness in fighting the Coronavirus. As the epidemic began, China fought very harshly and quickly overcame the crisis. But now, strict internal restrictions are put in place and new restrictions are imposed on entering the country, so that the virus does not enter it from European countries, as the number of infected people increases daily.\nThe article only expresses the opinion of the newspaper or the writer\nRead more: RT Arabic\nCorona is not an epidemic but a mercy from God Almighty\nThe death of the second Sudanese doctor in the face of the Corona virus in Britain, Sudanese doctor Amjad Al-Hourani joins the first leading doctors who lost their lives in the United Kingdom due to infection with the Corona virus, while participating in the fight against the new epidemic.

In Russia, they created three drugs that could potentially be used against the coronavirus COVID-19, said RIA Novosti vice president, head of the biomedical sciences section of the Russian Academy of Sciences, academician Vladimir Chekhonin.\nThere is no special drug in the world that can be prescribed in the treatment of a new coronavirus. Therefore, many countries are conducting clinical trials of existing drugs to study their effects on COVID-19.\nTo date, three drugs have shown activity against coronavirus: remdesivir - an intravenous drug with broad antiviral activity, as well as antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. The latter is used as the recommended antiviral agent for treating COVID-19 in China.\nAccording to Chekhonin, several years ago, an antiviral triazavirin was created in the country, which is now interested in Chinese doctors regarding the possibility of its use for the treatment of coronavirus infection.\nCoronavirus medicine: WHO told when testing begins >>\n“But for today, a special, inhaled form of this drug is ready, which can be used exclusively for the treatment of respiratory viral infection. I am sure that it will be more acceptable for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. And, of course, this option is extremely important in the current situation.” - Chekhonin noted, adding that the medicine is already ready for transfer to tests in specialized institutions.\nA synthesis scheme was also created for the antiviral drug favipiravir, previously developed in Japan for the treatment of infections caused by so-called RNA viruses, which include the current coronavirus.\nThe third drug, fortepren, was created on the basis of the drug phosprenyl, which is used to treat coronavirus infections in animals.\nIn addition, as the vice president of the Russian Academy of Sciences specified, three vaccines against a new infection are being developed in Russia with the participation of specialists from the Academy of Sciences.\nThe World Health Organization on March 11 declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. According to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 724 thousand people are already infected in 177 countries of the world.

From now on, the topic of open borders and the idea of reducing the role of the State in human life will be addressed with great caution. And Europe, which until now boasted of its freedoms, will have to restore them for a very long time.\nIt’s not even about the victory that China won\nThis is not even about serious shifts of \"tectonic\" geopolitical strata - everything is clear with this. Unable to (and not seeking) to help its closest ally - Europe - the United States will necessarily cede part of its influence to China. From now on, it can already be said with great certainty that Washington has already lost its war with Beijing for \"preventing\" the new Silk Road.\nBut in the trading game that the current US President Donald Trump started against his ideological and economic rival - China, access to the European consumer market was by no means a secondary trump card. And Trump has already lost this part of his trade war.\nOne cannot even speak about the role of Russia in this context. We are talking about such a global redistribution of civilizational values that it is not worth mentioning the anti-Russian sanctions imposed by the United States on the neck of Europeans. It is clear that amid the military transport IL-76, which landed in Italy with medical help, this is a trifle.\nBut today the fourteenth board has landed with military doctors and specialists, as well as with the equipment necessary to combat the coronavirus. In general, in the current situation, trade and financial and economic sanctions against Russia are not worth a penny - this is obvious. And it is unlikely that in the future they will play some role in the world that will come after the pandemic.\nNot for nothing, for example, in Poland, known for its anti-Russian mood, a quiet tantrum ripens. There, they understand better than everyone else the irreversibility of the changes that began in Europe. And they are quietly beasting from the fact that the maximum that this country is capable of is not to give an air corridor to the planes of the Russian aerospace forces, rushing to the aid of Italy suffocating from a lack of artificial breathing apparatus.\nBut they - Italy and Poland - are parts of a single European Union, allies in the NATO military bloc. And jointly unanimously adopted all the anti-Russian sanctions that the Americans dictated from across the ocean to their Atlantic “protégé”.\nEuropean trials are by no means coronavirus and pandemic\nThe current realities in which Europe found itself at once, suddenly, in just a couple of weeks, are completely different. And in these realities basic ideas no longer exist, designed to ensure the existence of a single market on which the principles of the European Union are based. There is no single economic space. The free movement of labor is not permitted.\nThe movement of goods, services and capital is tightly controlled. In current realities, it is possible that in the same Poland (and in the Czech Republic), batches of Chinese-made medical masks aimed at helping Italian doctors were intercepted. And in Italy the cargo for Greece was intercepted - 1840 devices intended for intensive care.\nThis is in the current realities in Italian Lombardy, not NATO, but Cuban virology specialists work. From that very Cuba, which has long been an outcast for the entire Western world. And it is precisely in the current geopolitical realities that the EU is at risk of providing financial assistance to a choking Iran.\nArmenia and the world in the \"era of COVID-19\", or the Way from economic losses to political games >>\nDid Europeans finally have the courage to go against the will of their overseas ally, who has long been doing everything possible to strangle this very Iran. But hitherto, Brussels had the courage to only hint slightly to Washington about the interests of European business in the Iranian market - as a sharp wave from the ocean followed.\nAll this, together, means that the very liberal, pseudo-democratic values that the gentlemen from the Brussels tribunes loved to talk about do not just leave, but have already left the stage of modern geopolitics. Civilization groups, trying to replace the idea of national statehood, simply could not stand the test ... by no means a coronavirus and a pandemic, no.\nThe very core of pseudo-democracy, from which the idea of European unity was fostered after the Second World War, turned out to be rotten. It turned out that history has not taught anyone anything. It turned out that the principle is delicious and sweet to sleep - it is very seductive in the wrapper in which America proposed it to Europe.\nWhile Italy is saved by Cubans, and in Spain, wild boars and bears run along the streets\nIt turned out that you can simply pay with money for the opportunity not to care about your national identity, put it under the control of someone else - and everything will be in full openwork. That security from threats and trials of the outside world can simply be bought. And in addition, get the opportunity to do literally anything you want (without any logical or traditional restrictions).\nAnd so, by and large, Europe lived the entire period after the Second World War (if we exclude the part that used to be part of the Eastern Bloc). As it turned out - until the first serious test, when only a coronavirus pandemic put everything in its place. She showed who and what is in the current world realities.\nAnd now, in fact, about the future of the European Union, about the principles and ideas on which its existence was based. The economic collapse caused by a pandemic will last an order of magnitude longer than the process of spread of infection. And these will not be the most “sweet” and trouble-free times of the EU.\nThe political and economic association of 28 countries in their current form will not be preserved: this is already understandable. A person (anyone) needs years, or even generations, to move away from the stress caused by the betrayal of your relative, friend, ally. And to this, to the awareness of the level of betrayal, the Europeans have not even reached yet. While doctors from Russia, Cuba and China are working in Italy, and wild boars and bears are running in Spanish cities, they won’t reach.\nAnd then there will be a recession. And not only economic, but also psychological. And Americans, always saving everyone (as is customary to show in Hollywood films), in this context it is better to launch as cranes in the sky. The titmouse in the hands will be China, ready to help, Russia, which by its nature does not remember evil ...\nA Deal of the Century in the Middle East: Trump Wants to Drive an Arab Hump into Jewish Paradise? >>\nAnd European states will shy away from each other for a long time - not because of the danger of getting infected, but because they do not trust each other.

Until he wants to replace the young shoots, it’s just delicious to eat and sleep sweetly, tempted to pay for it with money and your national identity and everything else."}, {"url": "http://www.albaladnews.net/more-271261-16-%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%A9%20%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9%20%D8%B4%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9%20%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81%20%D8%B3%D8%B1%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9%20%D8%B6%D8%AF%20%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7", "title": "A famous Russian doctor reveals the secret of immunity against corona", "text": "The doctor indicated that a person can get this important component from different foods such as shellfish, oats and corn flakes.\nAccording to Malysheva, the elderly with diabetes are among the most at risk of corona, due to the symptoms that may cause zinc deficiency in their bodies, which may affect the work of their immune system.\nThe doctor advised those suffering from cardiovascular diseases and cancer patients to add the Brazilian nuts to their diet as it contains selenium, which is considered an anti-oxidant and an important component to strengthen the immune system.

However, in recent days it has become the number one theme worldwide.\nOutbreak of a new coronavirus: what's happening in China. China continues to fight the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Already closed 13 cities. But the number of infected is growing\nSpoiled New Year of the Rat\n“Prophesied a biological bomb, Elena?”\n“I have always been an opponent of the search for black cats, which are often sought where they have never been and never are,” Larina answered. “However, a number of circumstances associated with the virus are, at least, surprising and make you seriously think that some coincidences are not accidental.” We can speak in the worst case of the first ever joint use of biological and information weapons, and in the less brutal - waging an information war against China with the cynical use of tragic events.\nLet's think it over. The epidemic began in late December. As of January 28, 2020, 105 people died from the new coronavirus, all in China! Infected over 4 thousand. Meanwhile, for example, during the winter of 2018, more than 80 thousand people died from colds and flu in the United States alone. The global media did not raise any panic.\nIn a strange way, the start of the epidemic coincided with the final part of the negotiations between China and the United States on a trade agreement, and at the same time as a discussion of personnel changes in key provinces and regions of China.\nIt’s very painful for Beijing to have a coronavirus outbreak. Wuhan is China's largest logistics center, where the country's air, rail, river and trucking services converge. Chinese scholars compare its significance with the transport role of Moscow in Russia.\nIn Wuhan, China, a coronavirus spreads.\nExtremely unfavorable for Beijing is the time of the beginning of the panic information cascade. The first death from the virus occurred on January 9. But up to the twentieth numbers everything in the informational plan was under control.\nOn November 21-22, the virus migrated to the world's number one news headlines. When Merkel announced the Europe-China Summit in response to the China-US trade deal.\nTimelapse of the high-speed construction of a hospital in Wuhan, which will open in early February.\n- And just a few days before January 25, the beginning of the Chinese New Year.\n- For the Celestial Empire this is a special holiday. Tens of millions of Chinese people usually travel around the country and abroad. However, it was precisely on these days that the complete blockade of Wuhan began. It is actually cut off from the rest of China. According to the mayor of Wuhan, more than 5 million people managed to leave the city. About 9 million people remained. Literally in real time, decisions are made to block all new cities in China. As of today, quarantine has already been introduced and the army, as well as police forces, have blocked entry and exit in cities where more than 50 million people live.\nBILLION LOSSES OF THE Middle Kingdom\n“These events, regardless of the causes that caused them, have three consequences,” continues analyst Elena Larina. - Firstly, China is already suffering billions in losses due to the disorganization of the economy, force majeure in logistics, and rapidly growing tensions in Chinese and Asian stock markets.\nSecondly, the growing internal tension due to the coronavirus requires literally all the attention and efforts of the Chinese leadership. This, of course, distracts him from the trade and economic confrontation with the United States, as well as from participating in the solution of various international problems.\nQuarantine in Wuhan: people fight for food.\n- President Xi Jinping of the PRC was forced to hold an extraordinary meeting the Communist Party political bureau the other day, at which he admitted that the country was in a difficult situation.\n- Thirdly, and perhaps this is the main problem for the PRC - the global media panic, inflated by leaps and bounds, inflicts a serious image blow on the Chinese abroad. In recent years, many European, Asian and Latin American tourist centers and capitals have become accustomed to hundreds of thousands and even millions of Chinese tourists. They not only visit attractions, but also leave gigantic funds in the restaurant, trade and other industries of Europe, Asia and America. The situation with the coronaviros, supposedly generated either by bats or snakes, which the Chinese eat, forms in the eyes of Europeans, other Asians, and the inhabitants of both Americas the image of the inhabitants of the Middle Kingdom as lepers capable of bringing something to their homes worse than the plague or smallpox.\n- Indeed, in different parts of the world, because of the terrible virus, the Chinese have already begun to fear. But who benefits from this universal panic?\n- It’s easier to say who is not profitable. Media around the world are often addicted to vulgar conspiracy theories. For any problem in the world they see the Anglo-Saxons, Rothschilds and Rockefellers and other dark forces. However, the modern world is very complex. It often initiators of certain, including aggressive actions, one, and others are beneficiaries. Therefore, the beneficiaries, which I will name, are by no means necessary, and even, most likely, are not the organizers of biotechnological aggression.\nSo, of course, the events taking place in China are beneficial to the current US Administration, which seeks to bring Beijing to its knees. As a result of Trump’s actions over the past year alone, US-China trade has fallen by 15%. Moreover, now the United States, in fact, is forcing, within the framework of the signed trade deal, to pay an indemnity in the form of compulsory imports of goods from the United States, including, by the way, oil and gas, by about $ 200 billion. The epidemic, of course, weakens the position of China and eases the pressure on it from the United States.\nThe epidemic began in late December. As of January 28, 2020, 105 people died from the new coronavirus, all in China! Photo: REUTERS\nIt must be borne in mind that in China there is a serious domestic political struggle. Not everyone in power is a supporter of Xi Jinping. Currently, three members of the Politburo and the former head of the General Staff are serving life sentences.\nFinally, any new viral threat leads to a sharp drop in the shares of some companies and to a rapid increase in the shares and profits of giant pharmaceutical companies. Accordingly, what is happening is beneficial for those stock market speculators who bet on a falling market and for the owners of Big Pharma.\nWuhan hospitals are crowded.\n- So, one of them gave the order to use biological weapons in the center of China, in the market in Wuhan, about which you spoke at the beginning of our conversation?\n- With almost 100% probability it can be argued that such an order was not given by one of the top leaders of any country in the world, including the United States. The current political world is too transparent, and if this had ever been revealed, the consequences for such a leader, his government and the party are simply impossible to imagine.\nIn my opinion, the matter may be different. Our planet has become much more dangerous with the advent of cyber, information and biotechnological weapons. Unlike nuclear, these types of weapons are almost impossible to limit and control. They can be created or simply acquired, as they say, by any group in the open market. And not only terrorist. In many countries there are so-called proponents - forces that have the necessary resources and seek, by carrying out cyber attacks or using genetic weapons, either to ensure their interests, including commercial ones, or try to please those in power.\nIn addition, unlike conventional wars, cyber or biological wars are not known when they begin. As a rule, the consequences of certain actions are already manifested. Accordingly, it is difficult to establish with 100% certainty who committed the attack.\n- There is one problem in the bio-attack version. Coronaviruses are not included in the list of potential components of biological weapons due to low mortality. The list includes anthrax, Ebola, Marburg and a number of other causative agents of epidemics with high mortality among patients.\n- This is not about the usual biological weapons of the last century, but about its modern modifications. Type of gene. By the way, during the Trump election campaign, some groups of the so-called alternative right, including white racists, neo-fascists, conspiracy theorists, widely discussed the topic of genetic, ethnic weapons. They wrote that the bird flu virus is an unsuccessful Chinese test of biological weapons against the white race. On the other hand, without any conspiracy, a piece of the speech of a professor, now deceased, about the SARS SARS epidemic in China in 2003 was shown on Chinese television. He bluntly said: “SARS was developed by the CIA specifically to kill the Chinese, and will not infect the Japanese. \"\n- Well, that SARS coronavirus, a fellow current 2019-nCoV, really caused that epidemic of SARS. 8437 people fell ill, 813 of them died. Mortality is about 10%. Due to the panic, China's GDP then lost 2%. Apparently, someone decided to repeat the coronavirus attack on China. But more extensive. Location and time were chosen successfully. By the way, there is a Sino-French laboratory in Wuhan, where they study the world's most terrible pathogens, the same Ebola, Marburg, which are potential components of biological weapons. You can cover the tracks. Say, this is the laboratory staff created the terrible 2019-nCoV and accidentally \"released the terrible gin from the bottle.\"\nAnd yet, Elena, talking about genetic weapons is more like fake, cheap conspiracy theories.

Former Donald Trump adviser indicated that American billionaire Bill Gates might have done this so he could grow microchips in people's heads to distinguish between those who tested COVID-19 and were not tested. Stone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM waves, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: \"Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate.\" He added that Bill Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to grow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations.\nAccording to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is linked to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain \"mandatory vaccinations.\" Stone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations. Gates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis such as coronaviruses, to the extent of recent talk about Gates's prediction of the disease 3 years ago. As the Washington Times reported, Gates announced earlier this month that his charitable organization would invest billions of dollars in factories that would focus on developing many vaccines.\nNote: The content of this news was written by the people of Egypt and does not express Egypt's point of view today, but was conveyed with its content as it is from the people of Egypt and we are not responsible for the content of the news and the custody of the previous source is a memory."}, {"url": "https://tsargrad.tv/news/nastuplenie-vsu-v-donbasse-otmenit-koronavirus-insajdery-zajavili-o-bolezni-majora_243757?fbclid=IwAR0ZyKcAnZ-69ES4g3i1Csu6pOtp2VLPhOHi96NFMydzgve5sLVZ55m_W0A", "title": "\"The offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Donbass will cancel the coronavirus\": Insiders have reported major illness", "text": "\"The offensive of the Armed Forces in the Donbass will cancel the coronavirus\": Insiders have reported major illness\nAccording to sources, Major of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Suprunyuk contracted the coronavirus from his daughter, and now all the soldiers of the brigade, which was supposed to go to the combat zone, are being tested.

Exhilarating in the long term, but rather scary in the short term. All empires eventually die and we’re in the terminal phase of the New World Order that will not recover from the Russian roulette game it has been playing, for Vladimir Putin handed it a loaded gun and it pulled the trigger.\nThe last few weeks put everything in place for the last battle. There are so many different facts and events, left and right, and I will try to do my best to remain methodical in this complicated expose. Bare with me, I’ve been struggling for three weeks with this article because of the insane amount of additional details that each day provides. It might have been a wrong time to quit smoking, but I enjoy a good challenge.\nDropping dollars\nA little context is required. The New World Order concept is simply the wish of a handful of international bankers that want to economically and politically rule the whole planet as one happy family. It started in 1773 and if it went through important changes over the years, but the concept and objective haven’t changed an iota. Unfortunately for them, international banks that have been looting the planet through the US dollar since 1944 are now threatened by hyperinflation, as their printing machine has been rotating for years to cover their absurd spendings to sustain oil and resource wars that they’ve all ultimately lost. In order to prevent this upcoming hyperinflation, they generated a virus attack on four countries (China, Iran, Italy and now the United States) to spread panic in the population, with the precious help of their ignominious medias. Even though this corona virus isn’t different from any new viruses that attack humans every year, the media scare pushed people to voluntarily isolate themselves through fear and terror. Some lost their jobs, companies are going bankrupt, the panic created a stock exchange crash that emptied wallets and dried assets, resulting in a few trillion virtual dollars off the market to release pressure off the currency.\nSo far, so good, but everything else went wrong in this desperate and ultimate banzai. The top virologist on the planet confirmed that chloroquine was being used by the Chinese with spectacular results to cure patients, then he improved his magic potion by adding a pneumonic antibacterial called azythromicin, and saved everyone of his first 1000 cases, but one. Donald Trump immediately imposed the same treatment through a fight against his own Federal Drug Administration, bought and owned by the deep state. This forced all medias to talk about Dr Didier Raoult’s Miracle Elixir, signing the death warrant on our confidence in all Western governments, their medical agencies, the World Health Organization, and medias that were trying to destroy the impeccable doctor’s reputation, while inventing sudden «dangerous side effects» of a nearly inoffensive drug that has been used for 60 years to treat malaria. Not so far away in Germany, internationally praised Dr Wolfgand Wodarg noted that the engineered panic was totally useless, since this virus isn’t any different than the others that affect us every years. This has been an amazing victory for Trump and the general population on social medias, whom exposed together the pathological lies of the official communication channels of every New World Order country. De facto, the credibility’s of these puppet governments have vanished in the air, and from the eye of the storm, Italy will surely exit the EU right after the crisis, which will trigger a domino effect running through every EU countries and NATO members. My friends, globalism is dead and ready for cremation.\nDigging the abyss\nInternational bankers couldn’t see it coming in 1991, when they dominated 95% of the planet after the fall of the Soviet Union. It seemed that nothing could halt their ultimate mission to complete their Orwellian dream: destroy a few countries in the Middle East, enlarge Israel, and get the total control over the world oil market, the last piece of their Xanadu puzzle that they’ve been working on for a whole century, starting with the Balfour declaration in 1917.\nWhen Vladimir Putin got charge of Russia, there was no sign that he would do better than the drunk he had replaced. An ex KGB officer seemed like a choice more driven by nostalgia rather than ideology, but Putin had many more assets going for him than first met the eyes: patriotism, humanism, a sense of justice, cunning ruse, a genius economist friend named Sergey Glazyev whom openly despised the New World Order, but above all, he embodied the reincarnation of the long lost Russian ideology of total political and economical independence. After a few years spent at draining the Russian swamp from the oligarchs and mafiosis that his stumbling predecessor had left in his trail of empty bottles, Vlad rolled his sleeves and got to work.\nBecause his opponents had been looting the planet for 250 years through colonization insured by a military dominance, Vlad knew that he had to start by building an invincible military machine. And he did. He came up with different types of hypersonic missiles that can’t be stopped, the best defensive systems on the planet, the best electronic jamming systems, and the best planes. Then to make sure that a nuclear war wouldn’t be an option, he came up with stuff which nightmares are made of, such as the Sarmat, the Poseidon and the Avangard, all unstoppable and able to destroy any country in a matter of a few hours.\nWith a new and unmatched arsenal, he could proceed to defeat any NATO force or any of its proxies, as he did starting in September 2015 in Syria. He proved to every country that independence from the NWO banking system was now a matter of choice. Putin not only won the Syrian war, but he won the support of many New World Order countries that suddenly switched sides upon realizing how invincible Russia had become. On a diplomatic level, it also got mighty China by its side, and then managed to protect independent oil producers such as Venezuela and Iran, while leaders like Erdogan of Turkey and Muhammad Ben Salman of Saudi Arabia decided to side with Russia, who isn’t holding the best poker hand, but the whole deck of cards.\nEnding in the conclusion that Putin now controls the all-mighty oil market, the unavoidable energy resource that lubricates economies and armies, while the banksters’ NATO can only watch, without any means to get it back. With the unbelievable results that Putin has been getting in the last five years, the New World Order suddenly looks like a house of cards about to crumble. The Empire of Banks has been terminally ill for five years, but it’s now on morphine, barely realizing what’s going on.\nTragedy and hope\nSince there is no hope in starting WW3 which is lost in advance, the last banzai came out of the bushes in the shape of a virus and the ensuing media creation of a fake pandemic. The main focus was to avoid a catastrophic hyperinflation of the humongous mass of US dollar that no one wants anymore, to have time to implement their virtual world crypto-currency, as if the chronically failing bankers still have any legitimacy to keep controlling our money supplies. It seemed at first that the plan could work. That’s when Vlad took out his revolver to start the Russian roulette game and bankers blew their brains out upon the pressure on the trigger.\nHe called a meeting with OPEP and killed the price of oil by refusing to lower Russia’s production, taking the barrel to under 30 dollars. Without any afterthought and certainly even less remorse, Vlad killed the costly Western oil production. All the dollars that had been taken out of the market had to be re-injected by the Fed and other central banks to avoid a downslide and the final disaster. By now, our dear bankers are out of solutions.\nIn the meantime, Trump also poked at the tie-wearing gangsters. While medias avoided the corona-killing chloroquine subject, an old pill designed to cure malaria, Trump imposed to the FDA the use of this life-saving drug on US infected patients. Medias didn’t have any choice but to start talking about it, which ignited a chain reaction: big pharmas CEO’s were fired because they had just lost the vaccine contract, countries like Canada looked like genocidal fools for not using the cheap and inoffensive medication, while a most outrageous criminal act by a government was exposed in full light: the Macron government had proclaimed in January 2020 that chloroquine was harmful and had restrained its use, just a couple of weeks before the burst of the fake pandemic! Russian roulette is a popular game in Western governments these days around.\nOn Saturday March 28th, Russia announced its own corona-killing brew, based on Dr Raoult’s magic potion. Yet another Cossack blow, this time to the big pharmas jugular vein, while most Western countries now have to implement the good doctor’s treatment, or face the slap of a Russian pill coming to save its citizen. Putin is in the lifesaving business these days: in the last week of March, he sent 15 military planes filled with doctors and supplies directly to North Italy, after an aid plane from China was blocked by the Czech Republic. We’re about to learn that European countries fear that China or Russia finds the truth in the Lombardy region, where people are not dying from some corona bug, but probably from a deadly cocktail hybrid from two earlier vaccines for meningitis and influenza, that they were injected in separate vaccination campaigns.\nThe punchline\nI said earlier that everyday brings amazing news. Well on Sunday March 29th, the most stunning of them all fell like a ton of bricks on social medias: confined onlookers learned that Trump had taken control over the Federal Reserve, that is now handled by two representatives of the Treasury of State. Of all the crazy news within the last month, this is by far the best and most shocking. After three years in power, Trump has finally fulfilled his electoral promise of taking private banks out of the US public affairs, ending a century of exploitation of the American citizens. He has put the infamous Blackrock investment group to start buying important corporations for the Fed, meaning that he’s nationalizing chunks of the economy, while avoiding the crash of the market by implicating important private investors in the deal.\nThis outmost daring move comes at a crucial point in time, and faces us with the realization that Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump are united and have taken humanity to the crossroads of the New World Order and freedom. As I have stated often before, I thought that the world would deeply change between 2020 and 2024, because these would be the last 4 years of these two heroes in political power of their nations.\nThe New World Order is facing the two most powerful countries on the planet, and this fake pandemic changed everything. It showed how desperate the banksters are, and if we don’t want to end up with nuclear warheads flying in both directions, Putin and Trump have to stop them now.\nTerminate the BIS, the World Bank, the IMF, the European Central bank, the EU, NATO, now. Our world won’t be perfect, but it might get much better soon.\nEaster resurrection is coming.

Photo by Brendan Smialovski / Getty\nPutschists under the canopy of a coronavirus\nWhile people's attention is focused on the growing statistics of coronavirus, a deep reorganization of the executive authorities is taking place, as a result of which the heads of the ministry of health take priority in politics. In the shadow, worried bankers and the military are hatching plans to usurp power. On February 1, Pentagon chief Mark Esper ordered General Terence O'Shaughnessy to be ready. On February 13, he announced at a meeting of the Senate Commission on Armed Forces that he should prepare for the worst-case scenario. In the event of a public health disaster, the government plan will make him the next dictator (in the ancient sense of the word) of the United States.\nThe primacy of administrative logic over politics\nMany governments in industrialized countries have responded to the Covid-19 epidemic by introducing restrictions on their citizens. This strategy does not stem from medicine itself, but from the management logic in the field of medicine, aimed at preventing the mass arrival of patients so as not to clog the hospitals. Therefore, our first lesson is that in developed countries, the logic of administrators currently prevails over medical experience. Nevertheless, even without medical skills, I have no doubt that millennia-old medical experience can be more effective against diseases than bureaucratic prescriptions.\nMoreover, at present, 10 deaths per million inhabitants are registered in Sweden, and 166 per million in Italy. Of course, this is only the beginning of the epidemic, and the two countries are very different. However, Italy is likely to face a second and then third wave of infection, while Sweden will gain group immunity and be protected from it.\nThe primacy of senior health officials over elected representatives\nRestrictions on the transport of goods violate not only the economy, but also the management system. Almost everywhere we see how politicians are inferior to senior health officials who look more effective than they are. However, they prefer to warn about the disease, but not to fight it.\nUnfortunately, contrary to the external form, we have not achieved effectiveness. For example, EU member states were unable to provide the necessary medical equipment and medicines in a timely manner. To blame - the usual rules. For example, economic globalization has led to the fact that there is only one manufacturer of respirators - China. Tenders take several months, and politicians can no longer circumvent these procedures. Only the United States was able to immediately solve this problem with corporate applications.\nFrance, which during the Second World War survived the so-called administrative dictatorship of Marshal Philippe Petain, has been dominated by senior officials for three decades. This is the power of people from the Graduate School of Management (ENArchie). The situation has deprived politicians of the knowledge of their administrative powers with which they are vested with a combination of local and national mandates. Elected officials are now less informed than senior officials, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to control them.\nJust as senior health officials suddenly find themselves above authority, which usually does not belong to them. Bankers and the military seek similarly to advance their interests - at the expense of politicians.\nBankers in the Shade\nFormer Secretary of the Treasury and Prime Minister Gordon Brown has published a column in the Financial Times calling for the use of fear of coronavirus to achieve goals that failed during the 2008 financial crisis. Then he failed to create a global financial government, and had to be content with the G20 format. According to him, today it would be possible to create a global health government and consider what powers should be delegated by the permanent members of the UN Security Council.\nNothing portends that this world government will succeed better than national governments. The only thing that is certain is that it will be spared any manifestations of democratic control. This project has no chance of success. By the way, Brown was also a staunch supporter of keeping Britain in the EU, and he lost again.\nDeep state in the shade\nHistorically, in all crises, someone is trying to use the “urgency” factor to modify power, and the public does not have time to think. Therefore, it often succeeds. On 30 January 2020, WHO declared a “public health emergency of international concern”. The next day, Secretary of Defense Esper secretly signs an order stating that the command of the US Armed Forces should be prepared for the possible application of the new rules to ensure \"continued government operation.\" They are classified as top secret. This means that only people with the highest level of access have access to them.\nThe principle of \"continuity of power\" was developed at the beginning of the Cold War. It was about protecting the United States in the event of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, the death or incapacity of the president, vice president and speaker of the House of Representatives. According to President Dwight Eisenhower’s written directive, the military government was to immediately ensure the continuity of command during the war - until the restoration of democratic procedures.\nThis interim government was never involved, with the exception of September 11, 2001, when Richard Clark became the national counter-terrorism coordinator. The fact that, as a result of the terrible attack, neither the president, nor the vice president, nor the speaker of the House of Representatives were killed or arrested, led me to conclude that this was an attempted coup. Be that as it may, President George W. Bush renewed his powers on the evening of the same day, and they did not begin to explain to anyone what had happened during the ten hours when his powers were suspended.\nAccording to Pentagon expert William Arkin, there were 7 separate plans:\nRescue and Evacuation of Residents of the White House (RESEM) - to protect the president, vice president and their families.\nJoint Emergency Evacuation Plan (JEEP) - to protect the Secretary of Defense and military leaders.\nAtlas Plan - To protect members of Congress and the Supreme Court.\nOctagon - of which we know nothing.\nFreejack - also unknown.\nZodiac - still unknown.\nGranite Shadow, which provided for the deployment of special forces in Washington and the conditions for the use of force by the military.\nPlease note that the RESEM plan aims to protect the president and vice president, but can only be used after they die or to protect their lives. In any case, the US military command in North America (NorthCom), led by General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, will be responsible for the implementation of these seven plans. It should be remembered that under US laws this person should become a dictator - he will receive power in the event of the death or incapacity of the three main elected representatives of the federal state. But in practice, the fate of his predecessor, General Ralph Eberhart, who did not get such power, awaits him.\nEberhart currently heads the largest military companies in the field of avionics. On February 13, General O'Shaughnessy told the Senate Commission on Armed Forces that his command was gearing up for the worst. To do this, he maintains daily contacts with ten headquarters of the US Army. NorthCom has power not only over the United States, but also over Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas.\nAccording to international agreements, he can, on his own initiative, deploy US troops in these three countries. In 2016, President Barack Obama signed Secret Directive No. 40, which guarantees the continuity of government. FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate signed the federal succession directive 2 days before assuming office of President Donald Trump, which outlines work algorithms at lower levels.

Do you need help? He says. You are amazed and even a little worried. What will he want? But, since you really need help, you invite him in. But - you think - maybe he wants something in return? No, apparently he doesn't ask for anything in return. He just wants to help. He comes into the house, gives you a hand, cleans the toilet, disinfects the living room, makes you eat and washes the dishes. Everything is normal. Tonight he leaves. You should be happy.\nAnd what are you doing? Instead of thanking him, you start yelling at the window that an attacker sneaked into your house. Who wants to take away the TV, which came to spy on you. Who wants to rule in your home, or rather wants to take you prisoner.\nThe neighbor will reasonably think that you are either an idiot or that you have become an idiot. He will think that the misfortune made you lose your mind. However, before you leave, one thing will tell you. That you are ungrateful and also that, worse for you, you won't see me next time even with binoculars.\nWhat is told here really happened (so to speak) in Italy. Russia has sent sixteen planes loaded with aid, accompanied by highly specialized personnel to help our country. People warmly welcomed the neighbor. But someone didn't like it. A certain Jacopo Iacoboni, specialized in the spread of germs of a disease - apparently very infectious - called russophobia, begins to write, in a notoriously Russophobic newspaper such as La Stampa\n, a wide \"series of havoc, bordering on caricature\" (as Prof. Angelo Dorsi well wrote), against the neighbor. accusing\n- according to mysterious sources, probably close to the Atlantic Council - to have come not to help but to exploit\nmischievously our misfortunes. Indeed to \"spy\", infiltrating agents of the Military Secret Service (GRU) in our barracks. But those - you say - had not gone to disinfect the hospices for the elderly? No, the brave Iacopo Iacoboni would reply, it is a classic diversion. Didn't they also invade Afghanistan?\n©\nSputnik. Natalya Seliverstova\nThe neighbor was irritated. How can you blame him? First the Ambassador replied\n, then a spokesperson\nof the Ministry of Defense (since the rescue team was all made up of military specialists). They never did! Jacopo Iacoboni became the champion of press freedom, \"threatened by Russia\". In his defense and exaltation, the director of the press, Molinari, followed by the intrepid cohort of the local Editorial Committee; the editorialist of Repubblica Bonini (who revealed to us how even his director was subject to threats, without specifying which ones); the Fnsi (that congregation of forgetful who doesn't know who Julian Assange is); Matteo Renzi, immediately voiced by Gennaro Migliore, from Italia Viva (I remember him in Porto Alegre when, together with Bertinotti, he waited, lined up in front of me, to shake hands with Hugo Chavez); the meritorious Association Art. 21 (of the Constitution), even with two comments, that of Riccardo Cristiano and that of Graziella Di Mambro; Forza Italy; + Europe; the Radical Party, running out of money; even Fratoianni, from Liberi & uguali, a left-over terminal remnant.\n©\nPhoto: Russian Ministry of Defense // Vadim Savitskiy\nIn short, the entire Atlantic parterre, without exception. Jacopo Iacoboni himself, finally risen to the top of fame, reiterated, also shooting on the Red Cross of the rescue: \"Freedom of expression and the right to criticize are fundamental values of our country, as well as the right of reply\". It is not excluded that RAI or AGCom put him in charge of some fact checking group.\nDidn't get - alas! - that Prime Minister Conte recalled the Ambassador of Italy to Moscow, but managed to obtain, perhaps with his entry into NATO, that the Italian Defense and Foreign Minister would join his personal, heroic defense.\nFortunately, Russian cargo planes have arrived with tanks almost full and will be able to return home without problems. Otherwise we would have refused the fuel.\nBut now I would like to offer some suggestions for the distinguished editor of La Stampa. Which, when he sends his reporters around to interview someone, maybe he could tell them to do two useful things to readers. The first is to not indulge too much with the \"authoritative sources\", without ever mentioning them. If the news he wants to report is really important, then he cannot leave the formula anonymous. On the other hand, if the source is that of a cacasotto, it cannot be authoritative, and therefore cannot be used. However not twice in the same article. Moderate use of anonymous \"authoritative sources\" is recommended. All the more so if \"the authoritative source\", behind whom the Iacoboni entrenches himself, says things \"that are neither in heaven nor on earth\"\n, as Ambassador Razov pointed out in the letter he sent to the editor of the press. On the other hand, we know that there are both \"authoritative\" and perfectly stupid sources. The monstrous fake news that the then US secretary of state, Colin Powell, pronounced in front of the whole world is worth mentioning, announcing that he has evidence of the \"weapons of mass destruction\" that would have been in Saddam Hussein's possession. I remember that La Stampa - of course with another director, and, of course, in the company of the whole western mainstream - took that fake as cast gold, without even putting it in quotes.\nIn that case the \"authoritative source\" spoke itself, to reveal to the world, implicitly how liar the aggressor and, together, the mainstream who supported him were. However, in this case, it is not clear why Jacopo Iacoboni prefers to pass him for stupid, citing an anonymous source, perhaps authoritative, but certainly stupid, instead of dumping all the garbage on it. Unless the \"authoritative source\" is the banal Anglo-Saxon trick of an invention by the author of the article, who has a great desire to write a bullshit, but is ashamed of it. Or, more likely, he fears having to give an account of what he writes in person.\nThe second suggestion could be derived from the unhappy interview that Iacoboni himself conducted with the former commander of an ultra-specialized department - it reads - the Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, and also from the battalion of \"NATO's Rapid Reaction \". It is surprising that Jacopo Iacoboni, having a truly \"authoritative\" source in front of him, did not ask him a simple simple question: how come NATO did not move a finger to help Italy and did eat the pasta in the head from the Kremlin? After all, Italy is a member of NATO, or rather one of the founders of NATO. To Mr. Hamish De Bretton-Gordon such a question should have been asked. Instead Jacopo Iacoboni has let the former commander ramble on the subject of intelligence that the bad Russians would be collecting on Italian territory.\nIn fact, if you think about it, the Russians could be very curious to know something about the Lombard virus (or rather about the viruses). And they could get some information (also useful to the Russians to defend themselves) about the origin of those viruses, and maybe who put them around, since some of those strains - among other things the most powerful - do not come from China at all (as we now know).\nBut the question that has not been asked is this: why hasn't the same curiosity occurred to NATO? There is an allied country where a deadly virus is rampant. There may be security problems, including military problems. And instead the Alliance does not even bother to collect information about it? Don't you even think of sending a department like that with the many names of the ex-commander with many names? Or, perhaps, does the Alliance already have all the necessary information?\nIn that case he could have provided them to the allied Italian government. But we haven't heard of this once on talk shows. We only heard of bats there.\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily coincide with those of Sputnik."}, {"url": "https://sputniknews.gr/apopseis/202004167078859-I-europi-dokimazei-tis-antohes-tis-anazitei-axones-filias-me-rosia---I-ellada/", "title": "Europe tests its endurance: Looking for \"axes of friendship\" with ...

It is an alliance of public-private partners, including UN agencies and civil society. It’s an electronic ID program that uses generalized vaccination as a platform for digital identity.\nIt seems, the more there is written about the causes of the Coronavirus – the more the written analyses are overshadowed by a propaganda and fear-mongering hype. Questions for the truth and arguments for where to look for the origins and how the virus may have spread and how to combat it, are lost in the noise of wanton chaos. But isn’t that what the “Black Men” behind this intended pandemic want – chaos, panic, hopelessness, leading to human vulnerability – a people becoming easy prey for manipulation?\nToday WHO declared the coronavirus COVID-19 a “pandemic” – when there is not the slightest trace of a pandemic. A pandemic might be the condition, when the death to infection rate reaches more than 12%. In Europe, the death rate is about 0.4%, or less. Except for Italy which is a special case, where the peak of the death rate was 6% (see below for further analysis).\n🚨 BREAKING 🚨\n\"We have therefore made the assessment that #COVID19 can be characterized as a pandemic\"-@DrTedros #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/JqdsM2051A\n— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) March 11, 2020\nChina, where the death rate peaked only a few weeks ago at about 3%, is back to 0.7% – and rapidly declining, while China is taking full control of the disease – and that with the help of a not-spoken-about medication developed 39 years ago by Cuba, called “Interferon Alpha 2B (IFNrec)”, very effective for fighting viruses and other diseases, but is not known and used in the world, because the US under the illegal embargo of Cuba does not allow the medication to be marketed internationally.\nWHO has most likely received orders from “above”, from those people who also manage Trump and the “leaders” (sic) of the European Union and her member countries, those who aim to control the world with force – the One World Order.\nThis has been on the drawing board for years. The final decision to go ahead NOW, was taken in January 2020 at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos – behind very much closed doors, of course. The Gates, GAVI (an association of vaccination-promoting pharmaceuticals), Rockefellers, Rothschilds et al, they are all behind this decision – the implementation of Agenda ID2020 – see below.\nAfter the pandemic has been officially declared, the next step may be – also at the recommendation either by WHO, or individual countries, “force vaccination”, under police and/or military surveillance. Those who refuse may be penalized (fines and / or jail – and force-vaccinated all the same).\nIf indeed force-vaccination will happen, another bonanza for Big Pharma, people really don’t know what type of cocktail will be put into the vaccine, maybe a slow killer, that acts-up only in a few years – or a disease that hits only the next generation – or a brain debilitating agent, or a gene that renders women infertile …. all is possible – always with the aim of full population control and population reduction. In a few years’ time, one doesn’t know, of course, where the disease comes from. That’s the level of technology our bio-war labs have reached (US, UK, Israel, Canada, Australia…).\nAnother hypothesis, at this point only a hypothesis, but a realistic one, is that along with the vaccination – if not with this one, then possibly with a later one, a nano-chip may be injected, unknown to the person being vaccinated. The chip may be remotely charged with all your personal data, including bank accounts – digital money. Yes, digital money that’s what “they” are aiming at, so you really have no control any more over your health and other intimate data, but also over your earnings and spending. Your money could be blocked, or taken away – as a ‘sanction’ for misbehavior, for swimming against the stream. You may become a mere slave of the masters. Comparatively, feudalism may appear like a walk in the park.\nIt’s not for nothing that Dr. Tedros, DG of WHO, said a few days ago, we must move towards digital money, because physical paper and coin money can spread diseases, especially endemic diseases, like the coronavirus. A precursor for things to come? – Or for things already here? – In many Scandinavian countries cash is largely banned and even a bar of chocalate can be paid only electronically.\nWe are moving towards a totalitarian state of the world. This is part of Agenda ID2020 – and these steps to be implemented now – prepared since long, including by the coronavirus computer simulation at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore on 18 October 2019, sponsored by the WEF and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\nBill Gates, one of the chief advocates of vaccinations for everybody, especially in Africa – is also a huge advocate of population reduction. Population reduction is among the goals of the elite within the WEF, the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Morgens – and a few more. The objective: fewer people (a small elite) can live longer and better with the reduced and limited resources Mother Earth is generously offering.\nThis had openly been propagated already in the 1960s and 70s by Henry Kissinger, Foreign Secretary in de Nixon Administration, a co-engineer of the Vietnam war, and main responsible for the semi-clandestine bombing of Cambodia, a genocide of millions of unarmed Cambodian civilians. Along with the CIA-Kissinger engineered coup on 9/11, 1973, in Chile, killing the democratically elected Salvador Allende and putting the military dictator Pinochet in power, Kissinger has committed war crimes. Today, he is a spokesman (so to speak) for Rockefeller and their “Bilderberger Society”.\nTwo weeks after the computer simulation at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, that “produced” (aka simulated) 65 million deaths (!), the COVID-19 virus first appeared in Wuhan. By now it is almost certain that the virus was brought to Wuhan from outside, most likely from a bio-war lab in the US. See also this and this.\n*\nWhat is the infamous ID2020? It is an alliance of public-private partners, including UN agencies and civil society. It’s an electronic ID program that uses generalized vaccination as a platform for digital identity. The program harnesses existing birth registration and vaccination operations to provide newborns with a portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity. GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, identifies itself on its website as a global health partnership of public and private sector organizations dedicated to “immunization for all”. GAVI is supported by WHO, and needless to say, its main partners and sponsors are the pharma-industry.\nThe ID2020 Alliance at their 2019 Summit, entitled “Rising to the Good ID Challenge”, in September 2019 in New York, decided to roll out their program in 2020, a decision confirmed by the WEF in January 2020 in Davos. Their digital identity program will be tested with the government of Bangladesh. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and “partners from academia and humanitarian relief” (as they call it), are part of the pioneer party.\nIs it just a coincidence that ID2020 is being rolled out at the onset of what WHO calls a Pandemic? – Or is a pandemic needed to ‘roll out’ the multiple devastating programs of ID2020?\nHere is what Anir Chowdhury, policy advisor of the Bangladesh government program, has to say:\n“We are implementing a forward-looking approach to digital identity that gives individuals control over their own personal information, while still building off existing systems and programs. The Government of Bangladesh recognizes that the design of digital identity systems carries far-reaching implications for individuals’ access to services and livelihoods, and we are eager to pioneer this approach.”\nWow! Does Mr. Anir Chowdhury know what he is getting into?\nBack to the Pandemic and the panic. Geneva, the European seat of the United Nations, including the headquarters of WHO, is basically shot down. Not unlike the lock-down that started in Venice and later expanded to northern Italy until a few days ago – and now the lock-down covers all of Italy. Similar lock-down may soon also be adopted by France – and other European vassal states to the Anglo-Zionist empire.\nNumerous memoranda with similar panic-mongering contents from different UN agencies in Geneva are circulating. Their key message is – cancel all mission travel, all events in Geneva, visits to the Palais des Nations, the Geneva Cathedral, other monuments and museums. The latest directives, many agencies instruct their staff to work from home, not to risk contamination from public transportation.\nThis ambiance of panic and fear – outstrips any sense of reality, when the truth doesn’t matter. People can’t even think any more about the causes and what may be behind it. Nobody believes you (anymore), when you refer to Event 201, the coronavirus simulation, the Wuhan Military Games, the closing last August 7, of the high-security biological war lab at Fort Detrick, Maryland…. what could have at one point been an eye opener for many, today is sheer conspiracy theory. The power of propaganda. A destabilizing power – destabilizing countries and people, destroying economies, creating hardship for people who may lose their jobs, usually the ones who can least afford it.\nAlso, at this time it becomes increasingly important to remind people that the outbreak in China was targeting the Chinese genome. Did it later mutate to transgress the ‘borders’ of Chinese DNA? When did that happen, if it happened? Because at the beginning it was clear that even the infected victims in other parts of the world, were to 99.9% of Chinese descent.\nWhat happened later, when the virus spread to Italy and Iran, is another issue, and opens the way to a number of speculations.\n(i) There were various strains of the virus circulated in sequence – so as to destabilize countries around the world and to confound the populace and media, so that especially nobody of the mainstream may come to the conclusion that the first strain was targeting China in a bio-war.\n(ii) In Iran, I have a strong suspicion that the virus was an enhanced form of MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, man-made, broke out first in Saudi Arabia in 2012 , directed to the Arabic genome) – which was somehow introduced into government circles (by aerosol spray?) – with the goal of “Regime Change” by COVID19-caused death. Its Washington’s wishful thinking for at least the last 30 years.\n(iii) In Italy – why Italy? – Maybe because Washington / Brussels wanted to hit Italy hard for having been officially the first country to sign a Belt and Road (BRI) accord with China (actually the first was Greece, but nobody is supposed to know that China came to the rescue of Greece, destroyed by Greece’s brothers, the EU members, mainly Germany and France).\n(iv) The hype about the high death to infection rate in Italy, as of the time of this writing: 10,149 infections vs. 631 deaths = death rate of 6.2 (comparatively Iran: 8042 infections vs. 291 deaths = 3.6 death rate). The death rate of Italy is almost double that of Iran and almost ten-fold that of average Europe. (Are these discrepancies the result of failures in the establishing reliable data pertaining to “infections”, see our observations pertaining to Italy below).\nWhy? – Was is Italy being affected with virus panic? Was there a much stronger strain introduced to Italy?\nThe common flu in Europe in the 2019 / 2020 season, has apparently so far killed about 16,000 (in the US the death toll is, according to CDC between 14,000 and 32,000, depending on which CDC website you look at).\nCould it be that among the Italian coronavirus deaths there were also common flu victims, as the affected victims are mostly elderly with respiratory preconditions? Also, symptoms are very similar between coronavirus and the common flu, and nobody questions and checks the official authorities’ narrative?\nMaybe not all the coronavirus strains come from the same laboratory. A journalist from Berlin of Ukrainian origin, told me this morning that Ukraine is host to some 5 high security US bio-war labs. They test regularly new viruses on the population – yet, when strange diseases break out in the surroundings of the labs, nobody is allowed to talk about it. Something similar, she says, is happening in Georgia, where there are even more Pentagon / CIA bio-war labs – and where also new and strange diseases break out.\nAll of this makes the composite picture even more complicated. Overarching all is this super hype is profit driven, the quest for instant profit, instant benefits from the suffering of the people. This panic making is a hundred-fold of what it’s worth. What these kingpins of the underworld, who pretend to run the upper world, perhaps miscalculated, is that in today’s globalized and vastly outsourced world the west depends massively on China’s supply chain, for consumer goods, and for intermediary merchandise – and, foremost for medication and medical equipment. At least 80% of medication or ingredients for medication, as well as for medical equipment comes from China. The western China dependence for antibiotics is even higher, some 90%. The potential impacts on health are devastating.\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 epidemic China’s production apparatus for everything was almost shut-down. For deliveries that were still made, merchandise vessels were regularly and categorically turned back from many harbors all around the world. So, the west has tricked itself into a shortage-of-everything mode by waging a de facto “economic war” on China. How long will it last? – Nobody knows, but China’s economy which was down by about half, has rapidly recovered to above 80% of what it was before the coronavirus hit. How long will it last to catch up with the backlog?\nWhat is behind it all? – A total crackdown with artificially induced panic to the point where people are screaming “help, give us vaccinations, display police and military for our security” – or even if the public despair doesn’t go that far, it would be easy for the EU and US authorities to impose a military stage of siege for “health protection of the people”. In fact, CDC (Center for Disease Control in Atlanta), has already designed harshly dictatorial directives for a “health emergency”.\nAlong with forced vaccination, who knows what would be contained in the cocktail of ‘’mini-diseases” injected, and what their long-term effects might be. Similar to those of GMOs, where all sorts of germs could be inserted without us, the commons, knowing?\nWe may indeed be just at the beginning of the implementation of ID2020 – which includes, forced vaccination, population reduction and total digital control of everybody – on the way to One World Order – and global financial hegemony – Full Spectrum Dominance, as the PNAC (Plan for a New American Century) likes to call it.\nA windfall for China. China has been purposely targeted for “economic destruction”, because of her rapidly advancing economy, an economy soon to overtake that of the now hegemon, the US of A, and because of China’s strong currency, the Yuan, also potentially overtaking the dollar as the world’s main reserve currency.\nBoth occurrences would mean the end of US dominance over the world. The coronavirus disease, now in more than 80 countries, has crashed the stock markets, a decline of at least 20% over the last few weeks – and rising; the feared consequences from the virus of an economic slow-down, if not recession, has slashed petrol prices within about two weeks almost in half. However, without China’s central bank interference, the Yuan’s value vis-à-vis the dollar has been rather stable, at around 7 Yuan to the dollar. That means, the Chinese economy, despite COVID-19, is receiving still much trust around the globe.\nAdvice to China – buy all the US and European corporate shares you can at current rock-bottom prices from the stock markets that collapsed by a fifth or more, plus buy lots of oil futures. When the prices recover, you have not only made billions, probably trillions from the west, but you also may own or hold significant and influence-yielding amounts of shares in most of the largest US and European corporations – and will be able to help call the shots of their future endeavors.\nThere is however, one little silver lining oscillating at the horizon full of dark clouds. It could miraculously be an awakening of consciousness of a critical mass that could put an end to it all. Although, we seem to be far from such a miracle, somewhere in a hidden corner of our brain, we all have a spark of consciousness left. We have the spiritual capacity to abandon the disaster path of western neoliberal capitalism, and instead espouse solidarity, compassion and love for each other and for our society. That may be the only way to break the gridlock and doom of western egocentric greed.\n*\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons above or below. Forward this article to your email lists.

It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\nIn this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells.

Deep social divisions and poor leadership in the West are just two of the reasons.\nEven as the coronavirus has spread like wildfire to 199 countries and territories around the world, a pattern of differential extent of devastation is evident. The list of worst affected countries with the highest recorded infections and deaths is overwhelmingly populated by Western democracies.\nBarring two exceptions — China, which is unique because the virus originated there and it has a one-party political system, and Iran — a mixture of theocracy and democracy, which is under harsh US economic sanctions — all the top victims are Western democracies. Comparatively, Asian democracies come lower down the list and may succeed in averting the calamitous mass-scale losses in lives and collapse of healthcare that have befallen Europe and the US.\nMoral persuasion & stern enforcement\nThree interrelated factors explain why Asian democracies are safer. Firstly, they have dynamic and confident leadership. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are commanding figures who enjoy high popularity and legitimacy with their respective citizens. When powerful and unifying politicians are in charge, the public follows and obeys directions and orders, especially during existential crises.\nRead more\nSocial compliance with government restrictions has been stronger in Asian democracies. The balanced mix of coaxing with moral persuasion and stern enforcement of rules which Asian leaders have adopted has found a receptive audience in their countries. For example, Modi has begged Indians“with folded hands”(a gesture of extreme humility in India) and sermonized about“responsible citizenship,”while hisofficials warned those flouting ‘Stay at Home’ orders of jail sentences.\nIf Asian leaders have convinced most of their people to abide by corona confinements, Western leaders have struggled. The sharp social polarization in Western Europe and the US between ‘liberal’ versus ‘populist’ camps has left large segments of populations bitterly opposing incumbent leaders. US President Donald Trump, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, and French President Emmanuel Macron are not cutting ice in their divided houses.\nThe level of trust that citizens must have in governments is low in the West and that has hurt its ability to mobilize people in a time of grave peril. Many Western leaders believe their political survival is delicately poised in such a poisoned atmosphere and hence delayed taking preventive actions to stem community transmission of the coronavirus out of nervousness about their approval ratings and re-election chances.\nAlso on rt.com US to China: drop dead, we get our jobs back.

Asian societies tend to be collectivist, where citizens have a hardwired willingness to sacrifice individual freedoms and undergo hardships for the sake of common well-being. The degrees of putting society over self vary among South Korea, Japan, India and Indonesia. But taken together and compared to Western Europe and North America, the Asians have an advantage of not seeing the individual and society or society and state as locked in perpetual conflict.\nUnlike Western democracies, whose political culture is shaped by asserting individualism, human rights and treating the state as an enemy of liberty, Asians mostly do not worry about violation of privacy or government abuses. One primary reason why Italy, for instance, could not stem the march of coronavirus had to do with the ingrained social practice of ‘Furbo’ (slyness or cunning behavior), whereby citizens are suspicious of perceived state repression and find tricks to evade governmental restrictions. Conte’s pleas that“we should not try to be clever”fell on deaf ears until it was too late.\nThe surreal sight of British pubs, Italian cafes, Spanish bars, French patisseries and American beaches teeming with mingling crowds in spite of state-imposed social distancing rules contains lessons. Rampant flouting of closure rules, which could have broken the chain of coronavirus transmission, as well as wrenching debates about the threat to civil liberties from creeping excesses of the government, have hampered Western democracies. On the other hand, South Korea faced little public resistance to using intelligence agencies to infiltrate cell phones and credit card details, track minutest movements of citizens, and intrusively perform contact tracing to break the virus’ transmission.\nAbility to override business lobbies\nThe third factor where Asian democracies have come out ahead of Western peers is in their ability to override business lobbies. Politicians like Trump, Johnson, Conte and Merkel waffled on imposing drastic lockdown measures at early stages out of fear that they would upset financial investors and hurt market sentiment.\nRead more\nEven as 1,300 people died in the US (as of March 27), Trump remains obstinate that the nationwide shutdown of businesses must be short and that the state must not interfere in the private sector to fill critical shortages. The fact that the coronavirus-induced economic shock has wiped out three years of the ‘Trump bump’ in the stock markets grates on the US president’s nerves, contributing to his fumbling response.\nIn contrast, Asian leaders tend to be statist. While none of them love economic recessions or are immune from pressure from business interest groups, these actors do not dominate the calculus of Modi or Moon. Abe did hold out on declaring a national emergency in Japan out of concern for forfeiting the vast commercial investments and sunk costs of the Tokyo Olympics, but he ultimately bowed to the larger public interest on health grounds by moving toward stricter restrictions to confront a“national crisis”and postponing the games.\nThere could be other idiosyncratic factors why Asian democracies appear to have been spared mass outbreaks of the virus. India enjoys a youthful population, which may reduce the death rate, pluswarmer temperatures, which could slow down the transmission.\nJapan and India have also not conducted widespread coronavirus testing the way South Korea did, implying their numbers will get worse over time. But the trend lines indicate that Asian democracies are stepping up with measures to avoid the dreaded ‘Phase 3’ of the virus’ transmission that was callously allowed to set in and hammer Western countries.\nQuality of political leadership and social attitudes matter in times of catastrophe. East might prove its superiority over the West in this mega crisis. For once, Western democracies and their news media should swallow their pride, keenly observe and learn from their Eastern counterparts.\nThink your friends would be interested?

They decided: a pandemic is not an accident.", "text": "Social network users found on the Internet a study of bat coronavirus, in which scientists were able to modify the strain so that it infects humans. Scientists from the USA were engaged in the work back in 2015, and people saw this as confirmation of one of their favorite conspiracy theories related to COVID-2019.\nThe COVID-2019 epidemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, managed to get out of China and spread throughout the world in two months. In mid-March, an article became popular in social networks according to which a dangerous strain was artificially created as part of a study of bat coronavirus by American scientists.\nThe scientific work was written by a team of biologists back in 2015, on November 9 of the same year it was published on the scientific portal Nature. Researchers studied the SHCo14 virus found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\nScientists combined this strain with another - its name is SARS, and it causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. Further, the researchers “generated and characterized a chimeric virus that can <...> multiply in the primary cells of the human respiratory tract.\" In other words, biologists altered the coronavirus of bats so much that they got a strain that could infect a person - and the virus would cause severe pneumonia in him. When it all ends, I will write an autobiographical masterpiece, \"How I Survived Without Leaving Home.\" What will you do?\nAmong the authors of the article are listed as researchers at the University of North Carolina, USA, and the Wuhan Virology Institute, China. In 2020, users of social networks read the old scientific material and they had suspicions about who is behind the COVID-2019 epidemic.\nIf some people, having read the article, decided to share with subscribers the very fact of its existence, then others are already building theories. They are sure: the coronavirus epidemic is the work of the US government, and one of the goals of this diversion was to strike at its own citizens.\nOn Russian-language Twitter, they also looked at the results of a study by scientists.\nWilly Wilmer, a German lawyer and politician, really believes that the coronavirus was brought to China by infected American soldiers who arrived in the country for sporting events. People agree with his version, and are ready to blame the United States for thousands of deaths.\nSome users are sure that there are only two countries that will repulse the United States in the situation with coronavirus, although they do not yet say how they will do it.\nAnd someone was not at all surprised that the United States was considered the culprit of the pandemic.\nThe comments did not answer the question, however, a military event was indeed held in China. The World War Games were held in Wuhan at the end of October 2019, probably Willy Wimmer referred to them. At least Igor Nikulin, a former member of the UN Commission on Biological and Chemical Weapons, interpreted the German politician’s assumption exactly and completely agree with him.\nBoth politicians came to such conclusions not without reason. These thoughts were prompted by the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China Zhao Lijian, who also believes that COVID-2019 was brought into his country by the US military. Users who commented on a post about Willy Wimmer’s words and laboratory research in North Carolina 2015, are sure that Americans are really to blame for everything - and only because of their attitude to the rest of the world.\nBut it was not difficult for other users to guess which television channel most commentators prefer to watch.\nAnd another commentator suggested that the reason for such hatred of people towards the USA is the refusal of medicines.\nAnother commentator, learning about the experiments in the laboratory of North Carolina, easily believed in the guilt of the States and even suggested what to do with this country.\nThe news that the coronavirus reached the United States, this person is very happy.\nBut there is an assumption that the United States came up with a coronavirus not only for China, but also for other countries. For each nationality - its own separate strain.\nIn fact, while the virus, supposedly created in 2015, is being discussed only by politicians and scientists far from laboratories. Until now, specialists in the region have not published the results of comparisons of strains.\nEven before people learned about research in the North Carolina laboratory, they were building theories about where the coronavirus came from, and there was nothing to do with natural causes. In their research, the main suspects were God, Putin and the Marxist revolutionaries.\nThere are other considerations in this regard. Before the coronavirus spread around the world and caused a pandemic, users of social networks began to speculate about who was behind it. Bill Gates and his wife came under fire from conspiracy theorists."}, {"url": "https://www.alarabi.press/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%86%D9%82%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A7-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1/", "title": "Report: US military may transfer SK to Chinese Wuhan", "text": "The World - The Americas\nAnd a former Professor at the University of Shanghai, Larry Romanov, stated in a report published by the Canadian Globalresearch, that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered last summer to close a large military biological laboratory at Fort Detrick base in Maryland, in anticipation of possible leaks.\nAfter the move, the United States last August witnessed a wave of pneumonia and similar diseases, and this was attributed to the repercussions of electronic cigarettes, but this hypothesis raised the suspicions of some experts.\nAfter that, media and activists in China reported that five of the Americans who participated in the international military games competitions hosted by Wuhan last October were infected with unspecified infection.\nChinese sources suggested that this mysterious disease was in fact \"Covid-19\", which he transferred to Wuhan, an American military, and he may have been infected by an accident not announced in Fort Detrick, and he was not diagnosed because of the absence of any concrete symptoms.\nSource"}, {"url": "https://arabic.rt.com/society/1094306-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%B5%D8%AF%D9%82%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A6%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A8-%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AC%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AC/", "title": "After I believed the expectation of the spread of Corona ... a Lebanese forecaster: an Arab doctor would find treatment!", "text": "After I believed the expectation of the spread of Corona ... a Lebanese forecaster: an Arab doctor will find treatment!\nComplex\nLebanese predictor Laila Abdel Latif expected the Corona virus to end overnight, indicating that an Arab doctor will find treatment.\nAbdel Latif's expectations came after activists circulated on social media, a video of her, predicting the spread of a serious epidemic during the year 2020.\nAbdul Latif said on the Kuwaiti channel, \"Scoop\", that the Corona virus is a biological war that the United States launched to fight China, but it got out of its control.\nShe added that the virus will end in two months in the Arab countries, noting that one of the Arab countries will invent a final treatment for this virus.\nAnd she said: \"An Arab doctor will shine its star, and he will be honored for his invention of a definitive treatment for corona virus.\"\nOn the other hand, Abdul Latif indicated that the spread of the Corona virus in the United States and European countries will take tens of thousands of lives, adding that US President Donald Trump will pass a very dangerous health parade.\nAbdel Latif said, in expectations published by the Lebanese channel \"LBCI\" on New Year's Eve, that the year 2020 will witness the spread of a dangerous and deadly virus.\nSource: RT"}, {"url": "https://arabic.rt.com/videoclub/1094755-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%AA-%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7/", "title": "Russia repelled the most dangerous epidemic of Corona!", "text": "Russia repelled the most dangerous epidemic of Corona!\nVideos\nIn 1960, the authorities of the Soviet Union were able to prevent the spread of the smallpox epidemic, through swift measures that contained the epidemic and spared the country a humanitarian catastrophe.\nIt used security forces to quarantine more than 10,000 people in Moscow in one week, and stopped flights, trains and cars.\nWill countries today be able to tackle Corona, as the Soviet Union did 60 years ago?"}, {"url": "https://www.albaladnews.net/more-269545-1-%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B2%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%8A%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%8A%20%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%20(5)%20%D8%B3%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA..%20%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1%20%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%B1%20%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%82%D9%8A%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%AA%20%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89%20%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B1%20%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9", "title": "The mystery of the coronavirus that slept (5) years! ..

In connection with the spreading epidemic, two cities were completely isolated: Wuhan and Huanggang, and cases of infection were recorded in South Korea, Japan, the USA and Thailand. Suspected infections have been identified in Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and even Russia. So, in St. Petersburg the third person was hospitalized with suspicion of this deadly disease. And if the versions with coronavirus disease in the previous two cases were disproved, then this time, the patient’s diagnosis is still being clarified. In total, 17 people died from the new epidemic and, presumably, up to 1700 people can be sick at the moment.\nRecall that not so long ago an agreement was signed on the first phase of a trade deal between the United States and China. In this regard, there were versions of the human factor in the origin of the epidemic. Former member of the UN Biological Weapons Commission, military expert Igor Nikulin told on the air of the NSN how plausible such a theory is.\n“Of course, there is no direct evidence that this was a diversion. But there is indirect evidence. If you look at the map of China, then the city of Wuhan is located in the center. This is the largest logistics center where all roads converge: automobile, rail, river. The largest transit airport is also located there. Therefore, the time and place when all this happened, unfortunately, is alarming. Because it was just before the Chinese New Year. Again, you can return to the American military laboratories. They surround not only the Russian Federation, but also China ... there are about 400 of them around the world, ”he concluded.\nEarlier, professor of the Far Eastern Federal University, head of the virology laboratory of the Federal Research Center for Biodiversity of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Mikhail Shchelkanov, on the air of NSN, pointed out the main danger of coronavirus.

They claim that global warming, species extinction, the emergence of superbugs and the eating of meat are somehow directly or indirectly linked to the outbreak of the current pandemic. They regard the fears and anxiety generated by the current public health emergency as an opportunity to promote the message that, unless we accept their dogma, humanity will become extinct.\nAlso on rt.com For the green zealots, Covid-19 is our penance for sins against the planet\nSome of them are positively overjoyed at the opportunity created by the climate of fear that’s all-pervasive across the world. “We’ve been trying for years to get people out of normal mode and into emergency mode,” enthused Margaret Klein Salamon, who heads the advocacy group The Climate Mobilization. She added that “what is possible politically is fundamentally different when lots of people get into emergency mode – when they fundamentally accept that there’s danger, and that if we want to be safe we need to do everything we can.”\nKeeping people in a state of fear of what they euphemistically describe as ‘emergency mode’ is the objective of Klein Salamon. As she stated, “now the challenge is to keep emergency mode activated about climate.”\nThat’s another way of saying that perpetuating –indeed, institutionalising– a climate of fear is the main objective of this movement. From this perspective Covid-19 is not so much a tragic public health issue but an instrument for realising the dream of a society that runs according to the environmentalist dogma of misanthropic miserabilism.\nWhat green fear entrepreneurs really hate is the spirit of human ambition, that refuses to defer to the dictates of nature. This is a spirit that is open to taking risks in order to transform the world through the use of science and technology. From the time when humans stepped out of their caves to taking the risk of travelling to space, there were always those who decided to do what was necessary to conquer their fears. The refusal not to give in to fears is always the first step towards looking for solutions that will allow us to assume greater control over our lives.\nIt is precisely this aspiration to take control and harness the power of nature and science that climate alarmists despise. They despise it so much that they have coined the term ‘human impact’ to suggest that what people have done to the planet is by definition wholly destructive. They hate humans’ impact on the world so much that many of them want to dramatically decrease the number of babies that are born.\nAlso on rt.com No, the coronavirus pandemic is NOT helping the environment\nAccording to the climate alarmist narrative, being scared for your life is the desirable state to be in. As Klein Salamon indicated, “we need to learn to be scared together, to agree on what we’re terrified about”! Why? Because collective fears will force governments to act!\nBack in the 17th century, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes anticipated the green politics of fear in his classic text, The Leviathan. Hobbes claimed that it is good when people are scared and frightened. Why? Because in their state of fear people will readily subject themselves to an absolutist ruler in exchange for his protection. One does not need a PhD in philosophy to understand that climate alarmist politics leads straight to the doorstep of the Leviathan.\nLike this story?

We have established a quarantine regime due to increased readiness to fight against coronavirus infection.\nWe explained to them that we have quarantine and they cannot drive to the hospital grounds. They allegedly came to give charity help, we explained that, firstly, we don’t need it, the hospital is fully equipped with all personal protective equipment,” Garik Khachatryan, head physician of the Central Clinical Hospital, told the 360 channel.\nHe noted that if Vasilyeva and her associates somehow want to help the hospital, then they can first write an official letter addressed to it.\nAlthough the head doctor emphasized that all the needs of the institution are met to the extent necessary by the regional Ministry of Health and the Government of the Moscow Region.\nThe doctor also denied reports of the neo-lbieral opposition’s supporters that the controversial video message about the lack of protective equipment that appeared on social networks was allegedly made in a Reutov hospital.\nHINT: Modern “liberalism” (often called “neo-liberalism”) is the ideology of serving to global financial monopolies and market speculators in general. The goal of such “liberals” is to increase their personal level of consumption with the minimal possible intellectual and physical work, using the margin simplification of modern communications and IT technologies, for satisfying their selfish, mainly bodily, desires covering them under the guise of post-modern sophistry. Thus, they swallow public resources undermining the steadily development of the humanity.\nHe explained that the personnel actually captured the medical workers of the Pokrovskaya hospital in St. Petersburg, but even there the management already commented on this topic, and said that there was no such thing.\n“I consider the situation that is now unfolding around Reutov hospital to be pre-planned at the moment when we are fighting around the clock for the lives of patients in this difficult time,” Garik Khachatryan summed up.\nAnastasia Vasilyeva and her associates have already noted strange “aid actions” in other regions. Previously, Vasilyeva took medical masks to hospitals in the Novgorod region, which already receive a shipment of 50,000 personal protective equipment kits every week.\nLater it turned out that the masks carried by Vasilyeva are even unsuitable for use by doctors, since they do not have certificates.\nAdditionally, with these actions, Vasilyeva practically ignores the regime of self-isolation established by the authorities, although she herself repeatedly called on everyone to stay home.\nAnother reported perpetuated by Latvia-based Russian-language media outlet Meduza (which ‘accidentially’ is focused on providing anti-government news from Russia) is this:\nA patient died in the hospital in Ufa.\nOn April 6th, an elderly patient with diabetes and pneumonia died at the Kuvatov Republican Clinical Hospital in Ufa.\nAccording to the head of Bashkiria, Radiy Khabirov, the death of the woman was caused by “cerebral edema against the background of a progressive ischemic cerebral infarction”, but the posthumous analysis on COVID-19 was positive.\nAccording to the Hospital’s head physician Elsa Syrtlanova, on April 6th, quarantine was introduced in the Kuvatov hospital. The Ministry of Health of Bashkiria clarified that all employees, including management, remained in the building.\nA video was published, in which an employee said that the hospital would continue working over the next two weeks, but they wouldn’t leave, as to adhere to the quarantine.\n“We will work day after day, as far as I understand, until we die,” the person in the video said.\nOn April 7th, an unnamed lawyer spoke with radio Echo Moscow, saying that the doctors in the Ufa hospital were not notified about the quarantine and that the administration not familiarize them with the decision of the head physician.\nHe, furthermore, accused the administration of the hospital of escaping through the window, and there’s even a video purportedly showing the situation.\nAll doctors at the G. G. Kuvatov Republican Clinical Hospital in Ufa. locked without official explanation, and the manual is washed off through the window. What's happening? pic.twitter.com/axxVB2CX2I\n- Anastasia Vasilyeva (@DrAnastasy) April 6, 2020\nAnd it is shared by none other than Anastasiya Vasilyeva.\nIn response, the deputy head physician of the Ufahospital, Elena Elkhova, in a conversation with the 360 channel said that the administration did not leave the building. (while the video demonsrates opposite)\n“I am in the hospital on the eighth floor. The head doctor is here too. Chief accountant, chief economist – everyone’s working. Nobody escaped,” she said.\nThe head physician, Elsa Syrtlanova, wrote on Facebook that employees of the procurement department who transferred computers for work at home were on the video. She did not specify why they were allowed to leave the hospital building, despite quarantine.\nMeanwhile, Russian citizens are dealing with the emergency measures in their own way.\nA video was shared, showing a man attempting to run away from doctors who are in full protective gear.\nA local resident (on the video above) was earlier taken to a psychiatric clinic with symptoms of acute respiratory viral infections.\nAfter being tested for COVID-19, the man was released for self-isolation until the results are ready.\nThe test came back positive. And when doctors in special suits arrived for the 28-year-old patient, he began to run from them. As a result, the sprinter was still caught and taken to the hospital.\nAnother man, living in Norilsk was filmed attempting to go outside during the lockdown, to walk his pet.\nThe video shows that the cat wasn’t exactly keen on going for a walk in the snow, but the man must’ve been fed up with sitting at home.\nNote that walking a pet is a legitimate reason to violate the introduced self-isolation regime due to the epidemic of coronavirus. There is only one condition: walking is allowed within 100 meters from the house.\nAnother hype topic exploited by the pro-Western opposition in Russia is the supposed suffering of businessmen in the country. While the lockdown really damaged the country’s small and medium buisiness, personalities of ‘heroes’ promoted by pro-opposition outlets and political activists to promote raise eyebrows. Most of them are rich persons that barely need any real social support from the government in the current conditions. At the same time, the situation with real small and medium buisinesses suffering damage remains underreported.\nSumming up, it becomes obvious that anti-government Western-backed forces are trying to use the COVID-19 crisis to destabilize the situation in Russia. They successfully exploiting the gaps in the government’s coverage of its actions in order to paint them as solely destructive and negative for the population and economy. For example, in the case with the UFA hospital, the government tried to cover up the situation instead of announcing an investigation into the situation and informing the public about the result of this investigation. If authorities call some claims and videos fake because they do not provide a wider picture of the covered situation (and background), it would be useful to publish additional data that would explain the situation and allow to contain the negative reaction of the audience.\nA successful example of working with such provocations is Kazakhstan. For example, in 2019, a series of videos providing radical and destructive nationalist views appeared in the country’s media sphere. This campaign was aimed at instigating ethnic tensions in the country. Authorities reacted to this situation with an investigation of all cases involved and employed methods of persuasion as well as administrative punishment measures towards the persons involved.\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n- COVID-19 And Oil Price Crisis Should Be Exploited Against Russia: Former U.S Ambassadors\n- COVID-19 Crisis In Russia: Evacuation Of Citizens From Abroad Delayed.

Here is a quote:\n“It is not easy to track the origin and find out the origin. However, our External Action Service in the last report, as well as in previous reports, revealed a very intensive production of misinformation from pro-Kremlin sources. And this also applies to the current crisis. We see increased propaganda against the EU. It is always the same story, its goal is to weaken the EU. To cause public distrust in EU institutions, and this is not only unfair, there has always been a lie, but it is not only an unfair lie, it is so dangerous during this period, and therefore we have significantly strengthened our counter-actions. We will never use the same weapon. I believe that we will not use any dirty propaganda against those who produce this news. \"We must fight by providing people with reliable information in the form of facts and figures that are easy to verify.”\nTo my disappointment, Ms. Yurova herself in this verbal exercise of the required information in the form of \"facts and figures that are easy to verify\" did not provide. As European Union analysts to which she refers have not presented them before. Only conclusions and speculation.\nFor the time being, I am only aware of one “fact” voiced by the EU, when the other day the Russian media accused of disseminating false information that the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in intensive care with a coronavirus. A speedy recovery to Boris Johnson, of course, but the fact from the Russian media turned out to be far from fake ...\nI have not seen or heard any other facts in the presentation of Brussels. Correct if I am mistaken. But I can cite here the glaring facts of lies and misinformation, circulated in the EU countries about Russia - both by journalists and officials.\nJammed by a publication in the Italian La Stampa, where it was argued that Russian medical and humanitarian aid to the north of Italy was “80% unnecessary” - by the way, strongly disproved by official Rome.\nNewspapers of the EU countries are filled with insinuations about the situation with coronavirus in Russia - they say, Moscow is hiding the truth about the scale of the epidemic, the necessary tests are not carried out, and effective assistance is not provided to those in need.\nToday, April 10, on the tenth anniversary of the tragic death of the President of Poland and his delegation in a plane crash near Smolensk, another wave of speculation on this topic by unscrupulous Polish politicians will fall upon Russia, saying, \"the Kremlin blew up the plane, we know for sure.\" The EU will remain silent.\nAnd, in conclusion, from tragedy to farce. In another EU country, Sweden, the Minister of Energy for three months carried nonsense that he was harassed by Russian hackers and bots, preventing the introduction of 5G networks. And when the local newspaper conducted an elementary investigation, it immediately became clear that the Swedes were poisoning the minister themselves, the Swedes, in foil caps protecting themselves from “harmful WiFi radiation”.\nThese are the facts. In each case, \"spoons\" are found, but the sediment does not disappear. Because there is such a profession in the European Union - to demonize Russia, blaming any problems of its own development on it.\nAnd the EU has problems of its own development after a rather inglorious passage through the first stage of the fight against coronavirus above the roof. How can you not frolic on the Russian topic? And at the same time, to be quiet, to demolish in the Czech Republic, where Vera Yurova was born, a monument to Marshal Konev, erected in gratitude for saving the Czechoslovak capital from destruction by the Nazis during the Prague uprising. Vera Yurova, who erupted the day before the fake quoted above, in this shameful story, I suppose, will remain silent.

Coronavirus checks the strength of the relationship between countries. So Italy, which was at the epicenter of the epidemic, accuses EU politicians that they did not come to the rescue. Moreover, they are also trying to drive the Apennines into debt according to the Greek scenario.\nEuropean values are turning into ashes scattered through the empty streets of Italian cities. EU flags are burned in Italian courtyards and defiantly removed from the offices of deputies of the Italian parliament.\nIn this video, Italians turn to Macron and Merkel. From the first days of the pandemic, the EU hastily closed its borders with Italy. At the same time, no word was heard from the high tribunes in Brussels about helping the Apennine Peninsula.\n“France sent an EMERCOM plane for sick old people of Lombardy. Germany sent a resuscitation team to Milan. ” Where is all this? This is not and never was. But there is a statement by IMF Director Christine Lagarde, who decided not to lower interest rates on Italy's debts to the European Union.\n- The great crises reveal the nature of people and states: the EU is trying to finish off Italy. Look at the statement of Christine Lagarde: she wants Italy to be overtaken by the fate of Greece. We must not allow this, ”said George Meloni, chairman of the Brothers of Italy Party.\nToday, almost all Italian politicians accuse the EU of betrayal. Former Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said: “Attention, please do not listen to Germany and the EU, do not borrow from them, this will doom us and our children to live in poverty.”\nItalian Prime Minister Conte proposed that the EU share responsibility in a pandemic and issue the so-called “coronabond,” bonds that all countries would support together. Spain agreed. But the process is hindered by wealthy Germany and France. Europe is drowning. And on this \"Titanic\" passengers are divided into first and second class.\n- Certainly, Brussels will now take advantage of the situation and try to drive Italy, like Greece, into debt so that in the future it will show greater flexibility and loyalty to Brussels. Because lately Italy has been marked by seditious ideas such as lifting sanctions from Russia and so on, ”comments Alexei Mukhin, political scientist, general director of the center for political information.\nItaly is already in second place in the EU in terms of public debt. And now another 70% of the companies are closed. Almost all economic activity has been discontinued.\nThe collapse in hospitals is precisely because at one time the EU demanded that the country optimize medicine, only five thousand mechanical ventilation devices for 60 million Italians.\nThis man tried to remove his mother’s pension from the bank, he now has no other income. It did not work, the bank was closed, he called the police.\nThe unemployment rate in southern Italy is more than 19%. Many work unofficially, which means they are not entitled to payments and compensation.\nIn Palermo, an organized group of 20 appeared in a supermarket, filled carts with groceries and refused to pay. Now the police are on duty at the stores.\nAnd the people of Naples lower such baskets from the windows of their houses, they put bread and fruits there, those who still have the opportunity to share with each other."}, {"url": "https://www.rt.com/op-ed/484652-covid-future-state-control/", "title": "What will 6 months of Covid-19 do to our society? Only certain thing is we'll be in a state... and the STATE will be IN CONTROL", "text": "Predicting the future is always notoriously difficult. The unprecedented response to the Covid-19 crisis means most bets are off on what may happen, apart from reinforcing the idea there is no alternative to state intervention.\nAlbert Einstein famously quipped that he never thought about the future because it came soon enough. He might have been a genius, but he didn’t experience the coronavirus crisis – and thus could not imagine a time when society would be so obsessed with thinking about the future.\nThere are a number of difficulties with trying to anticipate what society might be like after this crisis. In the first instance, we have no idea how long this will go on. Experts disagree. Some suggest lockdowns could be relaxed in three months. The UK government is now planning on at least six months. In each case, the outcomes could be significantly different.\nSecond, whatever happens in the future we can be sure there will be continuities and disruptions, and destructive and constructive dynamics at play. Crises are never one-way streets.\nBut – and this is critical – the coronavirus crisis will not bring year zero, a new era or clean slate in which what happened in the past will disappear or can be ignored. Nor will pandemics be the new normal. The exceptional peacetime actions taken by governments and central banks, and the reorganisation of society and the economy around lockdowns – which is inducing some behavioural changes – are temporary, not permanent.\nRead more\nBut the consequences, particularly of the unprecedented global state bailout which the Financial Times estimates to be around $4.5tn, will have a direct bearing on the future and in different ways.\nThe increased role of the state in the economy and society is the one definite in a sea of uncertainty. In the UK the government has promised loans and grants to businesses worth £330bn, and basic pay for company employees who are left workless. The Treasury is propping up wage support, grants, tax holidays and loan guarantees. It has relaxed banking regulations to ensure lenders can provide £190 billion of extra credit, and the authorities are using moral suasion to conscript them into the Covid ‘war effort’ and back small businesses. Even despite this, it is estimated that at least a fifth of small businesses will collapse.\nWith echoes of a wartime command economy, ministers are coordinating supermarkets to distribute food and manufacturers to make ventilators. This might evoke wartime parallels, but the analogy is inapt.\nWhy? Because in real global wars, capital is destroyed and forced to restructure, which creates the conditions for renewed growth. The post-war boom demonstrated this all too clearly in the 20th century.\nIn the coronavirus ‘war’, however, state spending and mobilisation are geared towards propping up pre-existing stagnation. And this is what is being studiously ignored in the many fantasies being suggested as heralding the future.\nAlso on rt.com The US was named the best equipped country to deal with a pandemic not a year ago — what happened there?\nClaims that this crisis is forcing traditional business to embrace the digital age, for example, are merely highlighting how vacuous the claims made by many are that we have been in a new fast-moving age of disruption and innovation. The fact that some old-line industries – from media and entertainment through retail to food and beverages – are having to go online to survive the lockdown highlights how stagnant, not innovative, so much of our economy has been, and remains.\nThe idea, too, that people working from home represents the future world of work is another make-believe forecast. While this may appeal to doomsday environmentalists – less commuting means less congestion, less pollution and lower CO2 – the real issue is what work they might be doing, rather than the fact that it is at home. Is it productive or decorative?\nThe so-called coronavirus war has revealed another less-acknowledged reality of the stagnant economy: namely that many essential jobs in our society are unskilled or semi-skilled, and that we depend more on these than the much-hyped white collar ‘information’ or service workers. How much difference would it make if many of the latter jobs simply disappeared? But the absence of construction, agricultural, transport, delivery, and indeed health workers, to name a few, brings home the fact that even in the ‘digital age’, we depend upon material production in sectors that have suffered decades of stagnation, non-investment and non-innovation.\nEven some highlights of the current crisis, like ‘Project Pitlane’ – the collaboration of seven F1 engineering teams based in England to rapidly develop a continuous positive airway pressure breathing device – should not be over-hyped. Without diminishing the accomplishment, we should soberly reflect on the fact that the best of British engineering has re-engineered an existing off-patent device, not created a breakthrough in health care.\nRead more\n‘Project Pitlane’ speaks to something quite critical about the future. The immediate crisis has made the world unfamiliar. But yesterday’s ideas have not disappeared. Wokeness, identity politics, inter-generational conflicts, and the culture of low expectations, will be back with a vengeance.\nMore importantly, the risk-averse culture of precaution around climate change in particular will be larger than life. Why? Because what people have seen in the behaviour of the state – particularly the disbanding of the rule book of fiscal responsibility – will raise the obvious question:“If all this is what was necessary to deal with Covid-19, what about the climate emergency?”After all, Covid-19 accomplished what Greta and Extinction Rebellion were advocating: shut down schools, stop flights, stop people driving cars, reduce our carbon footprints, stop fossil fuel exploitation, etc.\nAnd this is surely the point about the future. While the economic consequences are going to be felt for generations to come, the more immediate effect will be its political impact.\nWhat Covid-19 has already accomplished is the final nail in the coffin of the phoney post-war ideological battle between free-marketeers and state ‘socialists’. Already the banners flying in society have inscribed“There is no alternative to the State,”following Margaret Thatcher’s famous dictum ‘There is no alternative to the market’ after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989.\nWhen Howard Davies, the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, jokingly quipped in the Financial Times that“if the government said it was nationalising all the UK’s shoe shops, people would regard it as entirely plausible,”he was not exaggerating.\nThere has been no argument. There has been no political debate. But the state has won, and everything else will follow. If we thought yesterday’s tendency towards technocracy was strong, we haven’t seen anything yet. The authoritarian trends already on display in the current lockdown are perhaps a harbinger of a future society run along managerial principles.\nBut crises are never one-way streets. The examples of social solidarity we have seen suggest there are other forces at play that may positively influence the future. This remains an unknown. But the renewal of the role of the state is not. We do not need to speculate about its future; it has already arrived.\nThink your friends would be interested?

Earlier China, Cuba, Egypt and other non-Western countries expressed their willingness to help Europeans suffering from the coronavirus pandemic. Europe has become the planet's biggest problem because of the inability of Europeans to timely assess the danger of coronavirus, which has turned the continent into a global breeding ground for infection. The history of coronavirus puts an end to Europe's 500-year global dominance as a model for the development of society in the minds of people. By definition, \"sick planet man\" cannot be a model.\nEurope imposed itself on the world as a standard by means of unconditional military superiority. The advantage of Europeans over others was primarily the superiority of military equipment, and it was from the sixteenth century that gave an advantage in everything else.\nEurope's unprecedented levels of material well-being have been achieved by colonial seizures and the plunder of Asian, European and American civilizations deprived of the latest weapons. The largest European countries have established themselves as colonial empires.\nColonialism was one of the necessary conditions for the triumph of capitalism in Europe. Such necessary as the Reformation or the transition from medieval mysticism to rational and critical thinking.\nThe plunder of India or the Aztecs was one of the forms of initial capital accumulation that led to Europeans' centuries-old material well-being.\nTo understand the political structure of modern Europe, one more less obvious thing needs to be taken into account: historically, Europe's eastern periphery played the role of colonies for Europeans. For example, the great French historian Fernand Braudel directly connected the processes of European mastery of the Americas and the transformation of Eastern Europe into a resource addition to Western Europe.\nEastern Europe in the early phase of the New Era had undeveloped natural resources, but did not have technology (primarily military) to participate on an equal footing in the plunder of overseas lands. That is why Eastern Europe took part in the creation of the world capitalist system as a backward periphery from which resources are extracted. The First Republic enslaved Ukrainian and Belarusian peasants to ensure delivery of bread to Paris.\nThis system was recreated in the 21st century and today is called the European Union.\n\"After the most powerful European countries began to lose their overseas colonial empires, they built a kind of internal continental empire, based on economic and military cooperation,\" writes the Spanish political scientist Josep Colomer about the European Union.\nThe European \"standard\" of society development for centuries has been achieved by mastering the external resource base. The so-called European values have grown on fertile material foundations: the doctrine of human rights, the concept of freedom and equality for all people, European-style democracy. Europe, and then the USA, to which European civilization has expanded, imposed these values on the rest of the world, but demanded not consistent observance, but a demonstration of a subordinate position by recognizing values imposed from the outside.\nNowadays, Europeans have not had the opportunity to expand their resource base, and Europe's attractiveness has been steadily decreasing for many years.\nMilitary domination ended after World War II. Western Europeans found themselves under the \"nuclear umbrella\" of the United States, which in turn did not have an advantage in strategic weapons. Nuclear parity with the Soviet Union and guaranteed mutual destruction in the event of the use of nuclear weapons created a unique situation for 500 years, when in response to the strength of the West the same force appeared.\nAfter the collapse of the USSR, the West tried to rectify this situation, beginning NATO's expansion to the east and creating a global missile defense system. However, the creation of supersonic weapons by Russia has created an unprecedented phenomenon since the Middle Ages: European nations proved to be catching up in the field of the latest military equipment.\nWith the loss of military dominance, brilliant economic indicators also began to decline. The engine of global economic growth in recent decades has been China, which produced and sold its products around the world. The United States maintained the global leadership position in the economy due to the unique position of the dollar in the global financial system. Europe mostly overestained the wealth accumulated over the centuries of the Eurocentric world.\nIf until recently it had any advantage, it was only the so-called \"soft power\": the external attractiveness of the lifestyle shaped by Europeans, which one wanted to imitate and duplicate.\nLet Europe \"retire\", no longer participate in global politics, conquer new continents and even be unable to defend itself without the Americans, but clean streets, high-quality food, water that can be drunk from a tap ... In a broader sense - an effective state that cares for its citizens, hardly any corruption, democracy, human rights etc.\nThe history of the coronavirus put an end to Europe's \"soft power\": in the eyes of the whole world, it became a symbol of failure, catastrophe, stupidity, irresponsibility and sloppiness.\nEuropean countries first disregarded the spread of the new infection, considering it \"the same flu\", and then panicked to abolish the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens. The most striking example of this is freedom of movement.\nThe result of rushing from one extreme to the other: thousands of deaths from coronavirus, collapsed economy and the luminous picture of Europe falling with it - the ideal and the pinnacle of historical development.\nSuppressing its pride, the Old World humiliatingly copies Chinese experience in fighting a pandemic and receives humanitarian aid from Russia, Cuba, Egypt and China. Throughout 2010, Europe was an area of all kinds of crises and problems, but the coronavirus pandemic drew a line below them and turned quantity into quality.\nEurope is recognized as a \"sick man\" of the planet who needs surety, care, help and needs to be protected.\nEarlier the USA did it, and only to a limited extent. Now Americans are closing themselves to foreign problems in their hemisphere, and Europeans must be helped by the rest of the world. The times of Europe's attractiveness to the world are over. It is unlikely that anyone can now, in their right mind, recognize this diseased aging organism as the pinnacle of historical development."}, {"url": "https://www.aljoumhouria.com/ar/news/524590/%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81-%D8%B3%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%B6%D8%AF-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7", "title": "Doctor reveals the secret of immunity against corona!", "text": "Elena Malysheva, the famous Russian presenter and presenter, has enumerated some nutrients that are able to boost the body's immunity to fight the infection of the Coruna virus.\nDuring one of her televised medical programs, Malysheva said: “Food products that contain large amounts of zinc are necessary to activate the so-called killer cells in the body.

And the point is not that this disease has become a serious threat to humanity - no, this is not at all the level of the zombie apocalypse. The old world died because the relatively small threat of coronavirus brought globalization to its knees, and also dispelled all mantras about a “common destiny.\" Instead of jointly struggling with the problem and finding methods to minimize the consequences for human health and the economy, almost all countries chose to take the position of \"my hut from the edge.\" They were closed - even from their neighbors, with whom they are in allied relations within the framework of integration blocs.\nIt got to the point of absurdity - at some point Italy, the most affected of the European states, was helped not by Germany and France (EU leaders), but by Russia, China and Cuba, far from European affairs.\nIn some states, the coronavirus crisis so demolished the onset of civilization that they went to the direct blackmail of partners. In particular, Montenegro, popular among tourists, refused to let out Russian guests until Moscow, at its own expense, returned all Montenegrins to their homeland.\nApparently, the leaders of world countries have already assessed the degree of disunity that has manifested, and also realized how difficult it will be to live in a world where everyone will become for himself. Therefore, the task of the Big Twenty - a structure where all the leaders of the developed and developing world are present, it is a kind of \"Earth Board of Directors\" - was to work on the mistakes and finally begin to solve problems together.\nNot under the leadership of the United States (which are no longer the world leader, especially in the fight against coronavirus - America came out on top in the number of infected people, and there is still a long way to the peak of the epidemic), namely through the collective leadership of all G-20 countries.\nAs the nominal host of the summit, Saudi king Salman, correctly said, \"we have come together in order to join forces and act together.\" Moreover, it’s not only the victory over the coronavirus (as, again, rightly said Iranian ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali, “if the epidemic cannot be defeated in a single country, then no other state will be able to feel safe”). The countries of the world face an even more serious task - to cope with the consequences of the epidemic of the disease (and the hysteria surrounding it) for the global economy.\nSpecialists are still afraid to calculate losses, but it is already clear that they will amount to hundreds of billions, even trillions of dollars. And, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin, \"the current problems associated with the new coronavirus pandemic will turn into more massive shocks than the financial crisis of 2008-2009.\"\nEspecially these shocks, of course, will affect developing countries — which some selfish measures of the same West can save to save their own economies. \"None of us has the right to pursue a protectionist or unilateral policy,\" Turkish President Recep Erdogan is convinced.\nAnd where are the revolutionary measures to save the global economy?\nThe meeting itself was closed, and a lengthy declaration was adopted based on its results. It spells out the desire of the G20 states to fight the epidemic, together develop a vaccine, support WHO, urge everyone and everyone to invest in supporting the global economy.\nBut what is not there is real, to some extent even revolutionary measures to save the world economy and its pragmatization. To cleanse the world economy, as Vladimir Putin correctly noted, from \"political husks.\"\nSo, for example, Moscow and Tehran offered the West in the current difficult period to abandon politically motivated economic sanctions. Or at least weaken them so that the countries affected by the virus (the same Iran) can safely buy medicine and equipment. “It is important for the period of crisis to create the so-called green corridors free from trade wars and sanctions for the mutual supply of medicines, food, equipment and technology. Ideally, we should introduce a moratorium, a joint moratorium on restrictions on essential goods, as well as financial transactions \"for their purchases,\" Putin said. \"In the end, this is a matter of the life and death of people, it is a purely humanitarian issue.\"\nHowever, the proposal of the Russian president was not accepted - instead, the United States only tightens sanctions and, according to US special envoy Brian Hook, \"will continue the policy of maximum pressure on the Iranian regime.\" Thus, once again demonstrating his lack of understanding of new realities and the unwillingness to lead the world into a post-crisis future.\nAnother important common response would be stabilization of oil prices. However, the parties have not yet agreed on the methods of this stabilization. A number of countries and experts are sure that the keys to the process are in the hands of Vladimir Putin - Moscow should return to OPEC + and take on a voluntary restriction on oil production. Other experts explain that this return on previous terms is pointless.\nThe reduction in production by OPEC + countries leads to an increase in oil prices to acceptable for American shale oil companies, which increase their share in the world market - due to a decrease in the share of OPEC + member countries. This, in turn, leads to an increase in supply, a fall in prices, a further reduction in production by OPEC + countries - and further in the circle. Therefore, in fact, the keys to solving the problem are in the hands of Saudi Arabia (which should stop price dumping) and the United States (whose companies must behave in a civilized manner). Neither Washington nor Riyadh are ready to use these keys yet - therefore, according to official figures, the issue of oil prices was not discussed during the G20. Which once again showed the unwillingness of a number of G20 countries to live in a world without \"political husk.\""}, {"url": "http://www.khabaralyoum.com/news/get_news/7050/%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%8A%D8%A9..-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%BA%D9%8A%D9%91%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85", "title": "", "text": "Severity: Notice\nMessage: Undefined offset: 0\nFilename: controllers/News.php\nLine Number: 21\nBacktrace:\nFile: /home/khabaralyoum/public_html/application/controllers/News.php\nLine: 21\nFunction: _error_handler\nFile: /home/khabaralyoum/public_html/index.php\nLine: 292\nFunction: require_once\nSeverity: Notice\nMessage: Undefined offset: 0\nFilename: controllers/News.php\nLine Number: 24\nBacktrace:\nFile: /home/khabaralyoum/public_html/application/controllers/News.php\nLine: 24\nFunction: _error_handler\nFile: /home/khabaralyoum/public_html/index.php\nLine: 292\nFunction: require_once\nSeverity: Notice\nMessage: Undefined offset: 0\nFilename: controllers/News.php\nLine Number: 25\nBacktrace:\nFile: /home/khabaralyoum/public_html/application/controllers/News.php\nLine: 25\nFunction: _error_handler\nFile: /home/khabaralyoum/public_html/index.php\nLine: 292\nFunction: require_once\nSeverity: Notice\nMessage: Undefined offset: 0\nFilename: controllers/News.php\nLine Number: 25\nBacktrace:\nFile: /home/khabaralyoum/public_html/application/controllers/News.php\nLine: 25\nFunction: _error_handler\nFile: /home/khabaralyoum/public_html/index.php\nLine: 292\nFunction: require_once\nSeverity: Warning\nMessage: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /home/khabaralyoum/public_html/system/core/Exceptions.php:272)\nFilename: helpers/url_helper.php\nLine Number: 564\nBacktrace:\nFile: /home/khabaralyoum/public_html/application/controllers/News.php\nLine: 28\nFunction: redirect\nFile: /home/khabaralyoum/public_html/index.php\nLine: 292\nFunction: require_once"}, {"url": "https://khafayalb.com/news/khafaya101469.html", "title": "Accusations of Bill Gates ..

It is an alliance of public-private partners, including United Nations agencies and civil society. It is an electronic identification program that uses widespread vaccination as a platform for digital identity.\nIt seems that the more one writes about the causes of the Coronavirus, the darker the analyzes written by propaganda and an exaggeration of fear. Questions about the truth and arguments about where to look for the origins and how the virus has spread and how to fight it are lost in the noise of rampant chaos. But isn't that what the \"Black Men\" want behind this desired pandemic: chaos, panic, hopelessness, leading to human vulnerability, to people becoming easy prey for manipulation?\nToday, the WHO declared the coronavirus COVID-19 to be a \"pandemic\", when there is not the slightest trace of a pandemic. A pandemic could be the condition, when the death rate from infection reaches more than 12%. In Europe, the death rate is about 0.4%, or less. With the exception of Italy, which is a special case, where the peak of the mortality rate was 6% (see below for a more detailed analysis).\n\"WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction\"-@DrTedros #COVID19\n— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) March 11, 2020\nChina, where the death rate peaked a few weeks ago, at around 3%, has returned to 0.7%, and is declining rapidly, while China is taking full control of the disease, and that with the help from an unspoken medication. developed 39 years ago by Cuba, called \"Interferon Alfa 2B (IFNrec)\", very effective in fighting viruses and other diseases, but it is not known or used in the world, because the United States under the illegal embargo of Cuba does not allow the drug to be marketed internationally.\nMost likely, the WHO has received orders from \"above\", from those who also manage Trump and the \"leaders\" of the European Union and its member countries, those who seek to control the world with force - the world order\nThis has been on the drawing board for years. The final decision to go ahead NOW was made in January 2020 at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, of course, behind closed doors. The Gates, GAVI (an association of pharmaceuticals promoting vaccination), Rockefellers, Rothschilds and others are all behind this decision, the implementation of the ID2020 Agenda, see below.\nAfter the pandemic has been officially declared, the next step may be, also on the recommendation of the WHO or individual countries, to \"force vaccination\", under police and / or military surveillance. Those who refuse can be penalized (fines and / or jail, and vaccinated by force anyway).\nIf forced vaccination is indeed going to occur, another bonanza for Big Pharma, people really don't know what kind of cocktail will be applied to the vaccine, perhaps a slow killer, acting only in a few years, or a disease that affects only to the next generation, or a brain-wasting agent, or a gene that makes women infertile ... anything is possible, always with the goal of total population control and population reduction. In a few years, one does not know, of course, where the disease comes from. That is the level of technology that our biowar laboratories have achieved (USA, UK, Israel, Canada, Australia ...).\nAnother hypothesis, at this time only a hypothesis, but realistic, is that together with the vaccination, if not this, possibly with a later one, a nano-chip, unknown to the person being vaccinated, can be injected. The chip can be loaded remotely with all your personal data, including bank accounts - digital money. Yes, digital money is what \"they\" are aiming for, so you really no longer have control over your health and other personal data, but also over your earnings and expenses. Your money could be blocked or taken away, as a \"penalty\" for misconduct, for swimming against the current. You can become a simple slave to the masters. Comparatively, feudalism can appear as a walk in the park.\nIt is not for nothing that Dr. Tedros, WHO DG, said a few days ago, we must move towards digital money, because physical paper and coin money can spread diseases, especially endemic diseases such as the coronavirus. A forerunner of things to come? - Or for things that are already here? - In many Scandinavian countries, cash is widely prohibited and even a bar of chocalate can only be paid electronically.\nWe are moving towards a totalitarian state of the world. This is part of the ID2020 Agenda, and these steps will be implemented now, long overdue, including the computer simulation of the coronavirus at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore on October 18, 2019, sponsored by the WEF and the Bill and Melinda Foundation. Gates.\nBill Gates, one of the leading advocates of vaccines for all, especially in Africa, is also a strong advocate of population reduction. Population reduction is among the elite targets within the WEF, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Morgens, and a few more. The goal: Fewer people (a small elite) can live longer and better with the limited and limited resources that Mother Earth generously offers.\nHenry Kissinger, Foreign Secretary of the Nixon Administration, co-engineer of the Vietnam War and principally responsible for the semi-clandestine bombing of Cambodia, a genocide of millions of unarmed Cambodians, openly propagated this in the 1960s and 1970s. Civilians Along with the CIA-Kissinger-designed coup d'etat on September 11, 1973 in Chile, which killed the democratically elected Salvador Salvador Allende and put military dictator Pinochet in power, Kissinger has committed war crimes. Today he is a spokesperson (so to speak) for Rockefeller and his \"Bilderberger Society.\"\nTwo weeks after the computer simulation at the Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, which \"produced\" (also known as simulated) 65 million deaths (!), The COVID-19 virus first appeared in Wuhan. At this time, the virus was almost certainly brought into Wuhan from the outside, most likely from a biowar laboratory in the United States. See also this and this.\nWhat is the infamous ID2020? It is an alliance of public-private partners, including United Nations agencies and civil society. It is an electronic identification program that uses widespread vaccination as a platform for digital identity. The program leverages existing birth registration and vaccination operations to provide newborns with a persistent, biometrically linked digital digital identity. GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, identifies itself on its website as a global health association of public and private sector organizations dedicated to \"immunization for all.\" GAVI is supported by the WHO, and it goes without saying that its main partners and sponsors are the pharmaceutical industry.\nThe ID2020 Alliance at its 2019 Summit, titled 'Rising to the Good Identification Challenge', in September 2019 in New York, decided to implement its program in 2020, a decision confirmed by the FEM in January 2020 in Davos. Your digital identity program will be tested with the government of Bangladesh. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and \"partners in academia and humanitarian aid\" (as they call it), are part of the pioneering party.\nIs it just a coincidence that ID2020 is being implemented at the beginning of what WHO calls a pandemic? - Or is a pandemic needed to \"roll out\" the multiple devastating ID2020 programs?\nThis is what Anir Chowdhury, policy advisor to the Bangladesh government program, has to say:\n“We are implementing a forward looking approach to digital identity that gives people control over their own personal information, while building on existing systems and programs. The Government of Bangladesh recognizes that the design of digital identity systems has far-reaching implications for people's access to services and livelihoods, and we look forward to pioneering this approach. \"\nWoohoo! Does Mr. Anir Chowdhury know what he is getting into?\nBack to the pandemic and panic. Geneva, the European headquarters of the United Nations, including the WHO headquarters, is basically demolished. Not unlike the blockade that started in Venice and then expanded into northern Italy until a few days ago, and now the blockade covers all of Italy. France and other European vassal states could also adopt a blockade similar to the Anglo-Zionist empire.\nNumerous memoranda with similar panic alarm content from different UN agencies in Geneva are circulating. Its key message is: cancel all mission trips, all events in Geneva, visits to the Palais des Nations, the Geneva Cathedral, other monuments and museums. According to the latest directives, many agencies instruct their staff to work from home and not risk contamination from public transportation.\nThis atmosphere of panic and fear overcomes any sense of reality, when truth doesn't matter. People can't even think more about the causes and what may be behind this. Nobody believes you (anymore), when it comes to Event 201, the coronavirus simulation, the Wuhan Military Games, the closure last August 7, of the high security biological warfare laboratory in Fort Detrick, Maryland ... what could Having been a revelation to many, today is the theory of pure conspiracy. The power of propaganda. A destabilizing power: destabilizing countries and people, destroying economies, creating difficulties for people who can lose their jobs, generally those who can least afford it.\nFurthermore, at this time it becomes increasingly important to remind people that the outbreak in China was targeting the Chinese genome. Did you later mutate to transgress the \"frontiers\" of Chinese DNA? When did that happen, if it happened? Because at first it was clear that even infected victims in other parts of the world were 99.9% of Chinese descent.\nWhat happened next, when the virus spread to Italy and Iran, is another problem and opens the way for a series of speculations.\n(i) There were several strains of the virus circulated in sequence, in order to destabilize countries around the world and confuse the population and the media, so that especially no one from the mainstream can conclude that the first strain was targeted at China in A Biowar.\n(ii) In Iran, I have a strong suspicion that the virus was an improved form of MERS (Man-made Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, first broke out in Saudi Arabia in 2012, targeting the Arab genome), which somehow it was introduced into government circles (by aerosol?) - with the aim of \"Regime change\" for death caused by COVID19. They are Washington's illusions for at least the past 30 years.\n(iii) In Italy, why Italy? - Perhaps because Washington / Brussels wanted to hit Italy hard for having been officially the first country to sign a Belt and Road (BRI) agreement with China (actually, the first was Greece, but nobody is supposed to know that China came to the rescue of Greece, destroyed by the brothers of Greece, the members of the EU, mainly Germany and France).\n(iv) The hype about the high death rate from infection in Italy, at the time of writing this article: 10,149 infections vs. 631 deaths = 6.2 death rate (comparatively Iran: 8042 infections vs. 291 deaths = 3.6 death rate). Italy's death rate is almost twice that of Iran and almost ten times that of the European average. (Are these discrepancies the result of failure to establish reliable data related to \"infections\"? See our Italy-related observations below.)\nWhy? - Was Italy being affected by the panic virus? Was a much stronger tension introduced in Italy?\nThe common flu in Europe in the 2019/2020 season has apparently so far killed about 16,000 (in the US, the death toll is, according to the CDC, between 14,000 and 32,000, depending on the CDC website ).\nCould it be that among the Italian coronavirus deaths there were also common victims of the flu, since the victims affected are mostly elderly with previous respiratory conditions? Also, the symptoms are very similar between the coronavirus and the common flu, and does anyone question and verify the narrative of the official authorities?\nPerhaps not all coronavirus strains come from the same laboratory. A Ukrainian-born journalist from Berlin told me this morning that Ukraine houses about 5 high-security US biowar laboratories. They regularly test for new viruses in the population; however, when strange diseases arise in the surroundings of the laboratories, nobody can speak of it. Something similar, he says, is happening in Georgia, where there are even more Pentagon / CIA biowar laboratories, and where new and strange diseases are also emerging.\nAll of this makes the composite image even more complicated. Overall, this super hype is driven by profit, the pursuit of instant profits, instant benefits of people's suffering. This creation of panic is a hundred times greater than it is worth. What these underworld bosses, who claim to run the upper world, perhaps miscalculated, is that in today's globalized and outsourced world, the West relies heavily on China's supply chain, consumer goods, and intermediary merchandise, and especially drugs. and medical equipment. At least 80% of the drugs or drug ingredients, as well as for medical equipment, come from China. The dependence on antibiotics in western China is even higher, around 90%. The potential health impacts are devastating.\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 epidemic, China's production apparatus for almost everything was shut down. For deliveries that were still made, cargo ships were regularly and categorically returned from many ports around the world. So the West has deluded itself into a shortage of everything by waging a de facto \"economic war\" against China. How long will it last? - No one knows, but China's economy, which was cut in half, quickly recovered to more than 80% of what it was before the coronavirus hit. How long will it take to catch up on late work?\nWhat is behind all this? - A total offensive with artificially induced panic to the point where people shout \"help, vaccinate us, show the police and the army for our safety\", or even if public despair doesn't go that far, it would be easy for the authorities from the EU and EE. USA They will impose a military stage of siege for the \"protection of people's health.\" In fact, the CDC (Center for Disease Control in Atlanta) has already designed severely dictatorial directives for a \"health emergency.\"\nAlong with forced vaccination, who knows what the injected \"mini-disease\" cocktail would contain and what its long-term effects might be. Similar to those of GMOs, where all kinds of germs could be inserted without us, the common ones, knowing?\nIndeed, we could be right at the start of ID2020 implementation, which includes forced vaccination, population reduction, and full digital control of everyone, on the road to One World Order and global financial hegemony: Full spectrum dominance As PNAC (Plan for a New American Century) likes to call it.\nAn unexpected gain for China. China has been deliberately targeted for \"economic destruction\" because of its rapidly advancing economy, an economy that will soon outpace the now hegemonic, the US. USA The world's main reserve currency.\nBoth occurrences would mean the end of the dominion of the United States on the world. Coronavirus disease, now in more than 80 countries, has collapsed stock markets, a decline of at least 20% in recent weeks, and is on the rise; The dreaded virus consequences of an economic slowdown, if not a recession, have cut gasoline prices in about two weeks, almost in half. However, without interference from China's central bank, the value of the yuan against the dollar has been fairly stable, around 7 yuan per dollar. That means that the Chinese economy, despite COVID-19, continues to receive a lot of confidence around the world.\nAdvice to China: Buy all US corporate stocks. USA And Europe that can at the current prices of the stock markets that collapsed in a fifth or more, in addition to buying many oil futures. When prices recover, not only have you made billions, probably trillions of the west, but you can also own or have significant amounts of stock in most American and European corporations, and will be able to help call up photos of their futures. ventures.\nHowever, there is a small silver coating that swings across the horizon filled with dark clouds. Miraculously it could be an awakening of the consciousness of a critical mass that could end everything. Although it seems that we are far from such a miracle, somewhere in a hidden corner of our brain, we all have a spark of consciousness left. We have the spiritual capacity to abandon the path of disaster of Western neoliberal capitalism, and instead we defend solidarity, compassion and love for each other and for our society. That may be the only way to break the stagnation and ruin of Western egocentric greed.\n* *\nNote to readers: Click the share buttons above or below. Please forward this article to your email lists.

It is even more surprising when, for example, Arsen Torosyan announces that. \"Fires continue in Europe,\" \"Thousands of doctors have been infected in Italy.\" Or Nicole announces that. \"There are empty showcases all over the world.\" It turns out that writing that the coronavirus in the United States and Europe is causing concussions is consistent with the official information provided by Armenian officials. Which is required by the published requirements attached to the decision of the special state. Moreover, the following officials are talking about the shocks in Europe and the United States: Trump, Merkel, Macron, who are the highest state officials in those countries, which are not subject to the restrictions set by the Armenian government. \"Coronavirus is dramatically changing the course of life in our country now. \"Our perceptions of normalcy, public life and social coexistence, as never before, have been severely tested,\" said the German Chancellor.\nIt should be noted that the American CNN and Russian channels broadcast in Armenia show the shocks caused by the coronavirus in the USA and Europe from morning to evening. Therefore, the question arises as to how the above-mentioned article of \"Iravunk\" contradicts the restrictions imposed by the government on the media. At first glance, it is almost impossible to find an answer to the question, but in the article there is a very important episode, which concerns the suspicions of various officials and media outlets regarding the Pentagon-funded biological laboratories that these American laboratories are involved in creating this infection. : Probably, this is the topic that caused panic among our officials, but in this case, the panic did not arise in the society, but under the dictates of the Americans, in our authorities. Here is the revelation of the secret. In short, it can be concluded that the censorship of the government today is concerned with ensuring that the Americans do not say a sour word.

A shocking announcement comes after the United States, Italy, exceeded it to become the highest country in terms of the number of deaths in the world with the Corona virus, after the death toll reached more than 20,000 since the outbreak began. All these developments shed light on many questions, including the ways to confront Corona in America. The New York Times said that disputes erupted within the Trump administration over these methods, indicating Trump's delay in taking measures to deal with the epidemic despite receiving warnings from senior officials prior to its spread. What does the Trump declaration mean the major disaster? Why do some people insist pointing the finger at the Trump administration and holding it responsible for the spread of the epidemic in the United States and the world?

This opinion of the FBA \"Economy Today\" was voiced by State Duma deputy Anton Morozov.\nA court in the Netherlands, where the trial of the crash of the Malaysian Boeing in the Donbass will take place, warns: not everyone will be allowed into the courthouse. A corresponding order was issued by the country's Health Agency, motivating innovations with measures to combat coronavirus. So, people with the slightest signs of a cold will not be allowed to attend the meeting, and those who came from areas where the disease was spread will also not be able to attend.\nThe first hearing in the case of the wreck of a civilian board that crashed in Ukraine is scheduled for March 9 in The Hague. The liner, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur by flight МН17, crashed in Donbass in July 2014. As a result, all 298 people on board, including 80 children, were killed. The results of the investigation of the Dutch special commission say: the board was shot down by a ground-to-air missile from the Buk missile launcher. The militiamen of Donbass are accused of this, and Russia allegedly smuggled the missile system to them.\n“The statements that people will not be allowed into the meeting room because of the coronavirus cannot but alarm,” the parliamentarian notes. “First of all, because under this pretext, Russian participants in the process who defend the accused or are ready to provide The facts of the case In addition, with the same excuse, you can not hear the unnamed 13 witnesses who are supposedly ready to confirm the allegations against the Russians.\nFrom the point of view of the Russian Federation, the main thing is that the court decision is legally motivated and does not contain signs of political commitment. Therefore, everyone who is able to shed light on the true picture or help in the search for the truth should be allowed to participate in the process. And if Amsterdam tries, under the pretext of protection against infection, to remove the Russian participants, the Russian Federation will insist on their survey by video link.\nThe adversarial nature of the parties is a fundamental aspect of any fair trial. And if the rights of Russian lawyers, witnesses or representatives are violated, this will become the basis for the Russian Federation not to recognize the court decision. \"\nMH17 investigation was biased\nThe accused in the MH17 case are Russians Igor Girkin (Strelkov), Sergey Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov, as well as a citizen of Ukraine Leonid Kharchenko, they sent subpoenas to their addresses. In addition, they issued international warrants providing for forced delivery to court. The Netherlands said at the end of February that the identities of prosecution witnesses in this case should be kept secret. Initially, it was about 13 people, but the court rejected the request of one of them for anonymity.\nIn the very first days after the crash of the liner, Ukraine announced that Russia was to blame for the disaster. Soon, this version, even before the start of the investigation, was already broadcast by the politicians of Europe and the USA. The presumption of innocence and evidence was not discussed at all - Kiev, Brussels, Amsterdam and Washington peremptorily announced: the tragedy was planned and organized by Moscow. And no one explained why Russia needed to attack the passenger side.\nMalaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who resigned at the end of February, has repeatedly stated: the investigation is biased and is based only on unsubstantiated charges against Moscow.\n\"Initially, the whole story with the Malaysian Boeing was a provocation directed against the Russian Federation. It is obvious that the Ukrainian authorities deliberately let the civilian side into the war zone and did not ensure its safety. The involvement of the dispatchers on duty also testifies to Kiev’s involvement in the provocation that day, as well as a whole set of other witnesses from the responsible aviation personnel of Ukraine.\nBut it was precisely these people who could tell who in the country authorized the passage of a passenger liner through the conflict zone. Subsequently, we observed an extremely dubious investigation and clearly accusatory comments by Western \"experts.\" All this activity was anti-Russian in nature, so we were a priori denied the presumption of innocence. Nor did they take into account Russia's arguments in this case.\nOf course, we hope for European justice, which positions itself as impartial.

Here they point out which America they see \"the original source of the COVID-19 virus where the US military biological warfare laboratory at Fort Detik was the plant.\" America, which sought to destroy China, Iran and others ... far from this debate that has not been resolved yet as no one has confirmed how this virus came, the most dangerous thing that we stop with the consequences of the spread of this epidemic is the scandalous deficit that it has uncovered. A deficit on the scientific level to confront it, and behavioral scandals at the level of international relations in general and Western in particular ...\nIn the first place, the inability of the present human civilization appeared, namely the inability of the heads of Western civilization, who claim to lead the world in confronting the pandemic, with treatment and prevention. In the second aspect, the scandal of Western civilization appeared, and its selfishness, individuality and inhumanity were exposed, not even its brutality that it was practicing against others, and it became, in the time of the epidemic, practiced among its components.\nIn the scientific issue, the limited global scientific capacity has emerged from the confrontation, as despite the fact that more than 100 days have passed since the first appearance of this virus, bacteriological research laboratories worldwide have not been able to reach an understanding of the reality of this virus, draw its precise genetic map and understand its secrets that enable From the transition to the second stage in the confrontation that leads to the manufacture of the drug for treatment, and ending with the third stage, which is the most important, the most dangerous and the effective, which is the tightly prevented phase of it, which is the manufacture of the appropriate taste that prevents disease and protects completely from this dangerous virus and is still Pain and scientists are fumbling in the first and second stage and do not expect to reach a decisive result in the third stage a year ago.\nDespite all the media reported and the official’s statement here and there about the approach to reaching a cure or a protective taste, despite all that was said, the words remained promises and the virus continued to kill people. The strangest thing is that China, which was the primary focus of the disease, managed to control it spread and continues to search for treatment and taste, while Western Europe, or the mother of modern civilization, emerges as unable to confront. It became the first focus of the virus and almost lost control of it or almost succumbed to it, especially in the six largest countries in it, which are the most developed and advanced countries in all of Europe (Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Switzerland and Britain) which are now considered the gates of a real disaster, as the competent authorities describe To follow up on the topic.\nAs for the scandals, which are the most dangerous in terms of what the Corona virus revealed, it is what relates to the behavior of the West and the heads of modern capitalist civilization (neoliberalism); Inhumane and unethical. Here it is useful to stop at the photos that this disease has revealed as follows:\n1- The lie of Western solidarity and exposure to the ugliness of Western individuality and selfishness. Corona virus began to invade Europe from the Italian portal, and Italy remained struggling with the disease alone for two consecutive weeks without hearing or seeing a European or American voice or hand extending to it to help or offer help or even sympathy, and some even smelled Italy and felt it deserved this bacterial punishment Because it singled out in a trade and economic relationship with China separately from the Western position. A behavior that assured both far and near that Western solidarity and unity of position is a lie that was confirmed by Trump's position when he tried to monopolize what Germany reached in the path of searching for a drug and taste for the epidemic to use in America alone and prevent it from the world, including Europe.\n2- The brutality of the West towards man in general, including his own. Here, observers and the whole world stopped when refraining from providing assistance to those who needed it from countries or adopting criteria for discrimination in providing medical assistance within the same country, as happened in European countries that refrained from providing assistance to those over 65 or 70 years of age as if they divided patients between two categories A class worthy of life and a class sent to certain death. The British Prime Minister went out to his countrymen saying, with all the brutality, \"Prepare yourselves for the death of loved ones for you,\" and then say, \"Within 3 weeks, we will be in front of a disaster.\"\n3- The brutality of the leader of the capitalist world, America, and its racism towards states and peoples, especially against China and Iran, as it classified the virus as a Chinese in order to offend the China that conquered it, while the most brutal and inhuman American behavior appeared against Iran and was represented by tightening sanctions against it and preventing it from obtaining medicines and equipment. Medicines and raw materials used in laboratories to search for a drug, treatment, or taste against Corona. What made the world startled by the shock of this American brutality.\n4- Exposure of the weakness of the West in the face of disasters and epidemics and the absence of a collective strategy for joint action in confronting it. No one would have believed that the West was so weak in the face of an epidemic or a pandemic. Worse still, this debility appeared as a complex of self-intrinsic weakness within every European and American West, and it is organizational in the level of alliances, and America has emerged as it is. In it, if Europe needs it, it will not respond to it except to the extent that the American interest is, so if the interest is neglected, it will refrain from aid. Colonized and colonized at.\n5- Demonstrating the pure commercial character of the liberal system and making sure that it is completely removed from the human and moral nature. Whereas logic says that a person should be the center and target of every behavior. On this logic, the United Nations was created, and before it, the League of Nations for Human Rights and Protection of Human Rights - absolutely human being - and for international peace and peace, at the forefront of which is global health, we find the West today, especially America, which claims to be the leader of the world and seeks to establish a unipolar system and launched globalization that brought down The borders between the countries in favor of the stronger country, that is, America itself, despite all of this, we find that the Corona pandemic exposed the reality of this capitalist West, which has no value to man and has no importance for human feeling and does not weigh the relationship of friendship or alliance. And the importance of all importance is for the self, for commercial interests and material values, which showed the absolute ugliness of this system, so that every sane person was assured that it was an unacceptable system, whereby the world would organize, which is the system of gathering wealth, wasting people, and neglecting human existence and rights. Disclosure system of conflicts, wars and epidemics. Therefore, on this point in particular, we conclude that the greatest, first and most important victim of the Coronavirus is neoliberalism, brutal materialist capitalism and the international order established after the second war. And after he failed militarily and politically in the fields of the Middle East, especially in Syria and Yemen, he falls today with the final blow from the door of Corona.\n6- As for the shining bright picture that Hurricane Corona showed, it is what the targeted forces usually appeared from the Western powers, and those accused of various sorts in the field of human rights and global and human performance, especially China, Iran, and Russia, where these countries stressed the importance of a strong central state in Facing major dangers, and showed the human and moral aspect of the systems in them and their human nature, which prompted them to lend a helping hand to more than one country that was hurt by Corona. These countries, especially China, have affirmed their ability to confront and advocate without discrimination."}, {"url": "https://utro.ru/life/2020/03/06/1437711.shtml", "title": "In Ukraine, developed a remedy for coronavirus", "text": "Recipes\n- Diet Cake: Sugar-Free Dessert Recipe\n- Capital borscht: recipe for dark soup\n- Hot pita sandwich: breakfast recipe in 15 minutes\nA medicine called proteflazide can cure the COVID-19 virus.

He spoke about this in an interview with a correspondent for the Federal News Agency.\nPompeo and Stoltenberg blame Russia\nThe US State Department press service said that Mike Pompeo and Jens Stoltenberg discussed the situation with the global coronavirus pandemic.

The reason is, once again, there is no specifics other than attacks on Russia.\n“There is nothing concrete, no concrete information behind these words, except that“ I don’t know what, but still Russians are scum. ” Maybe this is their main goal, which they continue to pursue, ”said the senator.\nKlintsevich added that the behavior of the West and its psychology are difficult to understand today. However, if you dig deeper, it becomes clear - \"we were, are and remain enemies.\" Any achievements of Russia in the fight against the pandemic while the countries of Europe and the USA are in distress in this battle are considered as “enemy propaganda”.\n“We have experience, and two weeks earlier the country's leadership began to take specific measures and isolate people, seriously understanding that the incubation period will pass and we, having suffered dire economic, political, and some other consequences, will block and prevent the spread of [infection ]. And the fact that we do not have this (virus. - Note. FAN) in many subjects and that today the local actors themselves, taking into account the current legislation, are making all attempts to block possible penetration as much as possible - they do not take this into account, do not take it into account. And when we tell what we are doing, it suddenly becomes “hostile propaganda”, showing the imperfection of the Western system, ”Klintsevich explained.\nThe senator advised the US Secretary of State and NATO Secretary General to deal with the problems of combating the pandemic within their countries, and not information attacks against Russia. If the West continues to follow the same line of behavior, the consequences can be very serious.\n“Gentlemen, you are engaged in disease and people, not ideological stuffing. Today it is more important. If it goes on like this, you really will have half the population [fighting the disease]. And you will ask us to at least send soldiers to help take out the corpses. And this is not a joke - it is really a problem, and it is very serious. And he who misunderstands, then reaps very heavy fruits. And today, though, gentlemen, you are doing the wrong thing. If you mean what I was talking about, ”summarized Franz Klintsevich.\nRecall, the World Health Organization has announced an outbreak of a new coronavirus infection COVID-19 pandemic. According to the latest data, in the United States the number of infected has reached more than 189 thousand, 4079 cases have died. According to this indicator, the United States ranks first in the world."}, {"url": "https://cz.sputniknews.com/nazory/2020032511707248-evropa-epidemii-prezije-a-co-evropska-unie-nazor/", "title": "Europe will survive the epidemic. And what about the European Union? Opinion", "text": "The EU Economic and Financial Council has taken such radical action in light of the severe consequences foreseen for the EU economy due to the coronavirus pandemic. At the moment, the European Commission expects a decline of one percent in 2020. However, according to information from insiders, Brussels is also considering a much gloomier scenario, which assumes a decline of 2.5 percent and a sharp rise in unemployment. According to sources, this estimate may also be too optimistic, as it is not at all clear how long quarantine and other restrictive measures will apply.\nIn any case, it is clear that states will have to incur new and large debts to support the economy and the social sphere, which has led to the suspension of financial requirements common to the whole of Europe.\nIt should be noted that many EU Member States have long since not adhered to this framework, especially with regard to sovereign debt. During the global crisis of 2008 and 2009, several countries (mostly southern European) ignored budgetary discipline and spent trillions of euros to save their banking sector. This has caused uncontrollable debt growth and brought Italy, Spain, Ireland and other countries to the brink of default. The most difficult situation was, as is well known, in Greece.\nAfter all, the times are now such that the decision of Brussels does not look like an expression of will in difficult times, but as an official recognition of one's own helplessness, and this is another testament to the very difficult crisis of European unity.\nThe epidemic has shown the utter inability of the European bureaucracy to act in critical circumstances. All responsibility has been placed on the national authorities. And the hopes initially placed by some governments, including the Italian ones, in EU support have only slowed down the necessary measures and exacerbated the situation.\nWhat's more. The steps taken by the states have provoked numerous conflicts, including very scandalous ones. The Western press is full of mutual remorse and openly pronounced wrongs that people will surely remember for a long time. After all, the economic crisis is not just about the wallet, there are possible different approaches to the ideology of European solidarity that has been talked about so much in recent decades. And the lightning-fast rejection of high humanistic ideas in times of plague clearly shows their sincerity.\nThe world has seen a lot in recent weeks. Ignoring Italy's request to activate the European Civil Defense Mechanism for the supply of medical equipment and personal protective equipment. Europeans' refusal to provide neighbors with free medical capacity. And a very strict ban on the export of medical protective equipment and materials. And even withholding costs for other states.\nIn recent days, the situation has begun to improve at least a little - Germany, among others, is now accepting patients from Italy and French Alsace. Perhaps the leadership of European states has begun to understand that all this simply looks rude - especially against the background of the assistance provided to the suffering Italy by \"uncivilized\" countries.\nA video of Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mai from the airport unloading Russian air force planes transporting military doctors and medical facilities needed to fight the epidemic was watched (by the time this text was written) by four million web users and had 50,000 shares . And out of one hundred thousand comments, much of it contained very unkind words from Italians about neighbors, the EU and that \"European solidarity\".\nSo, basically, the new measures and decisions don't change anything.

So there is nothing to talk about any change in this context.\n\"This is an absolute, or, so to speak, certainly unrealistic, and in many respects absurd position,\" Peskov said, answering the question of whether a correction of Russia's position on Ukraine is conceivable.\nPreviously, former U.S. ambassadors to Kiev - Steven Pifer, John Herbst and William Taylor - voiced on the NPR radio website that, using the opportunity provided by the coronavirus epidemic, pressure could be put on Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine. and end the conflict in the Donbass.\nhttps://tsargrad.tv/articles/dajdzhest-smi-otobrat-krym-i-ne-umeret-ot-koronavirusa_246918?utm_source=pushilka2\nWill COVID-19 help take Crimea away from Russia?\nThree former U.S. ambassadors to Kiev - Steven Pifer, John Herbs and William Taylor - wrote articles for the National Public Radio website. It called for the Crimea to be taken away from Russia and for the Kremlin to \"violate international law\" in order to \"end the conflict in Ukraine\" using the corona virus epidemic.\n“Now that the crisis measuring public health and the global economy has peaked worldwide, COVID-19 offers an unexpected opportunity to end Europe’s only hot war and confront President Vladimir Putin’s attacks on international law,” the ambassadors write.\nIn their view, Russia will be under great pressure due to the spread of the coronavirus and the fall in world oil prices. In the situation, the United States and its allies could lift sanctions against Moscow \"if Putin puts an end to its military intervention in Ukraine.\" The ambassadors called on U.S. President Donald Trump and Congress not to miss this opportunity.\nSince Russia invaded the Ukrainian Crimea and the Donbass region in 2014, Russian troops and their local representatives have killed 14,000 Ukrainians in the Donetsk and Lugansk region of eastern Ukraine.

To do this, Moscow must renounce Crimea and be “in any way present” in Ukraine under the pretext of the coronavirus.

It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\nIn this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans.\nResearchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than previously thought.\"\nOn the other hand, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify \"potential risks\".\nSimon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: \"If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.\"\nIn October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on \"job promotion\", especially those that cause serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans.\nNew symptoms characterize infection with Corona virus\nDoctors also revealed the presence of new symptoms that characterize infection with the Coronavirus, unlike previously known symptoms when infected with the virus such as high fever and dry cough.\nNirmal Kumar, a British consultant doctor who specializes in ENT diseases, told Sky News that the loss of smell and taste is a new indication of coronavirus infection.\nThe known symptoms of a deadly disease ranged from fever, coughing, shortness of breath and feeling tired, among which was no loss of sense of smell and taste.\nBut Kumar said that \"a patient who suffers from a loss of sense of smell and taste, may also have Covid 19 virus.\"\nHe added, “The patient may not necessarily have symptoms of coughing and fever. Therefore, those who feel a loss of sense of smell and taste should resort to self-isolation. ”\n\"This is new evidence of corona infection,\" he concluded.\nThe death toll from the Corona virus has now exceeded the barrier of 3,000, while the number of infected people is close to 310,000.\nThe end\nwww.iraq.shafaqna.com / End"}, {"url": "https://www.albidda.net/world/3317446.html", "title": "The page is not available", "text": "Sorry, the page you are trying to reach is not available.

Neither where he was born, nor how he was born, nor what his purposes are, provided he has it, nor how long he will stop in our part. He, the virus appears to have come from China and was intended for the Chinese only. Instead, to the general surprise, he moved with the speed of lightning - indeed suspect and, until now inexplicable - in Italy, from where he infected a good part of Europe, proving, among other things, that Brexit it doesn't interest him at all, even coming to the end in the United States. Surprisingly right there - if the thesis were true that from some of the American military labs it somehow escaped.\nWe can already say - many are now aware of it - that this new and unexpected, unwanted guest will change the whole world, starting with all the cornerstones of common life that have characterized the last two centuries of the history of human civilization, at least of those two and a half billion individuals who have experienced so-called American globalization since the end of World War II. Which, as we know, proposed to dismantle not only all the current habits and ideas of the world of the twentieth century but, among them, aimed to demolish even the nation states. At least all the minor ones, seen as now useless obstacles to the triumphal march of the essential freedoms of the dominant Anglo-Saxon neo-liberalism.\nWhat no one predicted is that, apparently, just three months after it appears on the planetary scene, Coronavirus will accomplish some of these revolutionary purposes. The initiative passes from the hands of Man's incessant Promethean activity - what Shumpeter defined as \"creative destruction\" - to those of Nature.\nNow the impression gained from the effect of the first blows of this unprecedented world emergency is that the end is in turn approaching also for the EU. Of course it is unlikely that the European Union would collapse with the sudden speed with which the Soviet Union collapsed, in 1991. But it is conceivable that the history of this project will decree that the true beginning of its sunset is fixed on the date of appearance of the coronavirus in Europe i.e. at the age of 63. It is at this juncture that all the pillars of European \"integration\" begin to yield, one after the other, with impressive speed and without anyone even managing to set up any defense that stands in the way of the imminent collapse. Nature has taken over human claims and regulations. See the question of the so-called \"freedom of movement\" of individuals, both within the European space, and between it and the outside. It had been one of the cornerstones of European pride.\nThere remains the only freedom that in conditions of neo-liberal capitalism is untouchable, like a sacred totem: the freedom of capitals to move where it suits them. But of European solidarity, after the brutal way in which the Greek debt crisis has been managed, and after what is taking place, it will be difficult to speak.\nJust think that, until March 16, the Euro-group agenda was still embedded in the idea of activating the European Save States Mechanism (MES): a new supranational structure that provided for new vexatious forms, harmful to the national sovereignty of the individual member states, and aimed not at saving them in the event of a crisis, but at binding them to banking rules totally removed from their control. The events have naturally done justice to such nonsense and the MES has left the scene, also overwhelmed by the size of the disaster. But this incredible Brussels short-sightedness demonstrates to what extent European leaders were unable to grasp the flood that was about to overwhelm them. A few days after the events - that is, the forecasts of collapse of world industrial and agricultural production - they also blew up the notorious \"stability pact\" with which the Union had sought to ironically define every possibility of the governments of the Member States to take measures to economic and social development corresponding to the needs of the respective populations.\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily coincide with those of Sputnik."}, {"url": "https://sahafahnet.net/", "title": "Net Press", "text": "Instead of the transitional council implementing an agreement\nInstead of the transitional council implementing the Riyadh agreement\nThe South set up a revolution and made your own state thrivers and get recognition\nDr..

An exciting report that throws oil on fire, \"Conspiracy Theory\"", "text": "| 22.03,20. 06:50 PM |\nThe mystery of the coronavirus, which has slept 5 years!\nThe controversy over the origin of the new coronavirus (Corona) has not subsided since it broke out in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, killing thousands and wounding about a quarter of a million people around the world.\nThis controversy escalated, especially between the United States and China, to the highest levels, as US President Donald Trump described it as a Chinese virus, while Beijing suspected that he was an American.\nAlthough scientists and specialists are now busy combating this deadly epidemic, regardless of its source, and some confirm that there are no indications of its creation and that it is a \"natural\" virus known to \"lineage\", it was exposed to a mutation that turned it into a \"killer\" that has the ability to penetrate human cells, except A report published by the American journal, Nature, known for its sobriety, still threw more oil on \"conspiracy theory\" oil.\nThis report was published on November 12, 2015, and reported that US scientists have created in the laboratory a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats in connection with a virus that causes SARS, that is, acute respiratory syndrome.\nThe magazine revealed about 5 years ago that scientists had examined a virus called \"SHC014\", which was found in horseshoe bats in China.\nThese scientists combined the surface protein of \"SHC014\" with the SARS virus, and came out with a new virus that provided the surface protein with a structure that helps it penetrate into the cells of the human respiratory system. It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.\nThe mystery of the 5-year-old coronavirus! .. An exciting report casting oil on fire\nIn this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans.\nResearchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than previously thought.\"\nIn contrast, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify \"potential risks\".\nSimon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on the news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: \"If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.\"\nIn October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on \"job promotion\", especially those causing serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans.\nNATURE/rt"}, {"url": "https://moragboonpress.net/news29642.html", "title": "How did the Soviet Union respond to a more serious epidemic than Corona?

On 30 January, he declared the virus an international emergency, but made clear that there was no reason for countries to issue travel-advisories against travelling to China. Let me speculate – the ‘international emergency’ was declared at the request of Washington, and the comment against the travel-advisory was an addition by Dr. Tedros himself, as he realized that there was indeed no reason for panic, that China is doing wonders in stemming the virus from spreading and in detecting the virus early on.\nIn fact, Dr. Tedros has himself, as well as other high-ranking WHO officials, on various occasions praised China for her effort to contain the virus, the speed with which Wuhan (population of 11 million, capital of the center-eastern Province of Hubei) and China as a whole has reacted to the outbreak. The latest achievement – in 8 days China has built in Wuhan a 25,000 m2 special hospital for treatment of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV and possible mutations, with 1,000 beds, and for about 1,400 medical personnel, for a budget of the equivalent of US$ 43 million – equipped with state-of-the-art medical technology. No other country in the world would have been capable of such an achievement.\nNevertheless, and against WHO’s guidance, Washington immediately advised its citizens not to travel to China, and withdrew non-essential staff from US consulates and the Embassy in Beijing, thereby triggering an avalanche of similar reactions among Washington vassals around the globe – i.e. most of the European countries did likewise, many of them canceled their flights to China, as did of course the US.\nRussia also closed her 4,200 km long border, working hand-in-hand with China in containing the virus. This also means that no infected Russian citizen may leave China. This is a concerted Chinese-Russian effort – spearheaded by China – to control and contain the epidemic.\nThe NYT and WashPo are on a vicious daily campaign to slander and vilify China with lies and manipulated information on how badly China is managing the disease, when the complete opposite is the case. Compare this to the common flu epidemic, that hits the US and most of the western countries, despite the fact that the US and Europe have virtually implemented carpet vaccination (in some US States and EU countries even compulsory).\nYet, this 2019 / 2020 flu season which is far from over, has so far claimed more than 8,400 lives alone in the US, more than 140,000 hospitalizations and more than 8 million infected people. The US has about 330 million people. Compare this to China’s 1.4 billion population – with, as of 3 February, an infection rate of less than 21,000, a death toll of 425 in China, and outside of China reported two, one in Hong Kong, another one in the Philippines.\nExpand these statistics to Europe and you find similar figures. Of course, nobody talks about it. This is an annual occurrence – a bonanza for the western pharma industry. In the west, disease is business. The more the merrier. Once you are in the “medical mill”, it’s difficult to escape. “Specialists’ find always another reason to send you yet to another “specialist” – for another treatment. The ignorant patient has no option than to obey – after all its his health and life. In China it is the total opposite. The Chinese system does everything for its population’s health and well-being.\nYet, China bashing in one way or another seems to intensify by the day. Yesterday, 3 February, the UN in Geneva has issued an edict that all UN employees returning from China must stay home and work from home for 14 days, i.e. a dictated self-quarantine. And new contracts for Chinese staff will be temporarily suspended. This is all propaganda against China.\nQuarantine is absolutely not necessary. Chinese biologists of the Office of Science and Technology of the city of Wuxi (south-eastern Jiangsu province, near Shanghai) have developed a test kit that can detect the 2019-nCoV virus within 8 – 15 minutes, similar to a pregnancy test. This test kit is available to the world. In fact, it has been used to test an airline crew member arriving from New York at the Zurich airport and feeling ill. Within less than an hour, the crew member was sent home – it was the common flu.\nIn China, where by now scientific evidence is mounting that the disease – like all the coronaviral diseases, including the 2019-nCoV predecessor SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 2002 / 2003 also in China), and its Middle East equivalent, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) are not only laboratory fabricated, but also patented. And so are many others, for example, Ebola and HIV. Both, SARS and 2019-nCoV are not only man-made, but they are also focusing on the Chinese race. That’s why you find very few people infected in the 18 countries where the coronavirus has spread.\nIt sounds like a strange coincidence that in October 2019 a simulation with precisely the coronavirus was carried out at the John Hopkins Institute in the US, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the WEF (World Economic Forum), as well as the Pirbright Institute of the UK, one of the world’s few level 4 (highest security level) bio-warfare laboratories (for more details see “China’s Coronavirus: A Global Health Emergency is Launched. What are the Facts”).\n*\nThe west’s ‘demolition’ priority seems to have shifted drastically from Russia to China. Why? – Because China is an ever-stronger economic power, soon to surpass the United States in absolute terms. Since mid-2017, China is already number one, measured by the PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) indicator, indeed the most important one, because it demonstrates what people can actually buy with the money.\nChina’s currency, the Yuan, is also advancing rapidly as a reserve currency, gradually replacing the US-dollar. When that happens, that real money, like the Chinese Yuan, based on a hard economy and covered by gold, against a “fake” fiat currency (based on nothing), like the US-dollar, is taking the lead, then the US-dollar hegemony is broken and the US economy doomed.\nTo prevent that from happening Washington is doing everything possible to destabilize China – see Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Uyghurs in China’s western Xinjiang Province, Tibet, the infamous Trump-inspired “tariff war” – and now the new coronavirus outbreak. The death toll is at present about 2.1% (of total cases of infection), down from 2.3% a week ago.\nBut that and the constant bashing with negative western propaganda, travel bans, border closures, flight bans – and more – plus the disease itself, the medical care, work absenteeism, medication and medical equipment, not to forget the specially-built 1,000-bed emergency hospital in Wuhan – and an 8% average decline at the Shanghai stock exchange, bear a considerable economic cost for China. So much so, that the People’s Bank of China (PBC) has recently injected some 1.2 billion yuan (about US$ 174 million equivalent) into the economy.\nThis new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, may just be a trial. Imagine a stronger mutation of a coronavirus would be implanted into the Chinese population, say with a mortality rate of 10% to 20% or higher – it could cause real havoc. However, a stronger version may not be so easily controllable and directable – i.e. towards the Chinese race – and may risk spreading to the Caucasian race as well – meaning the executioner would risk committing mass suicide.\nRemember the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the deadliest in history, infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide – at that time about one-third of the planet’s population – and killed at least 50 million people (a death rate of 10%), including some 700,000 Americans.\nWhile preparing for the worst, because Washington – with the help of its level 4 bio-war lab – will not let go easily, China’s approach of endless inventive creation, avoiding conflicts, will outlive the aggressor.\n*\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.

She led to one thing - hatred fell on her. And where they did not expect this. On Thursday, a plane with Ukrainians and foreigners flew from Chinese Wuhan. Finally, the Ukrainian authorities got their hands to the evacuation of their own, and then something unimaginable began. Three of the country's airports, three, refused to take on board. The region where quarantine will be organized was kept secret. But you can’t hide anything on the Internet. Either Ternopil, or Lviv, or Poltava region. And there they began to build barricades and carry tires so as not to let people in. His fellow countrymen, and not infected.\nChina, as you recall, does not let anyone out with temperature. After the plane nevertheless landed, people under heavy convoy were taken to the Poltava region. There the circus ended and a nightmare began - stones flew into the buses. And maybe it’s good that the stones, because some ATO veterans publicly regretted that eh ... The wrong plane was shot down over the Donbass. And they wrote about it online. Cyril Sergeyev about what fear degenerates into.\nFights, screams and absolute anarchy right on the streets - this is how compatriots from the Chinese province of Hubei are met in the Ukrainian outback. A special board from Wuhan delivered immediately 70 people with suspected coronavirus. Near Poltava they’re not just unhappy - they are preparing for an uprising.\nResidents of the Lviv region fell into the same collective madness. Another quarantine center at the base of a military hospital is supposedly being prepared there. People build barricades from tires, block roads, pitch tents. So that a terrible virus does not appear on their land, they are ready to stand around the clock.\nThe incubation period of a new coronavirus may be much longer\nNeither the police nor the servant of the people can explain to the Ukrainians that it is not about “strangers”, but about “their own people” - people persistently oppose fellow countrymen. The only ones who agreed to welcome fellow citizens with joy are people from Donetsk. To the gates of the medical center in Novy Sanzhary, they constantly bring gifts and food.\n“People are divided, the country is divided: west - east, conflicts between different parts of Ukraine. People in this atmosphere care primarily about themselves, ”says Yuri Svetov, a political scientist.\nSuch savage behavior of citizens of Independence is easily explained by political scientists. Experts are sure that the experience of the Maidan and the politics of recent years have left their imprint on the consciousness of Ukrainians. The hatred of the population against the Russians, who have been cultivated there for years, now turns against the people themselves.\n“They carried out some order and walked with shields and batons at armed law enforcement officers. Well, how can a sane person think that if a bus with people passes nearby, he will get the flu. It’s obviously people have been cheated, ”said Ruslan Kotsaba, a political scientist.\nSurprisingly, a similar craziness on the basis of the coronavirus affected even the Japanese authorities - their actions are already called by experts the failure of the century. In early February, the vessel Diamond Princess with one sick on board was forcibly moored off the coast of Yokohama. During quarantine, no one was infected on the shore, but almost six hundred people were inside the ship. The liner design played a cruel joke - narrow passages and a general ventilation system.\n“Firstly, people have become hostages of the situation. Secondly, it only aggravated the situation. Now, instead of practically healthy fellow citizens, many countries will receive a share of those infected and possibly ill, ”said Alexander Abdin, a member of the medical council under the governor of St. Petersburg.\nEight Russian citizens evacuated from Diamond Princess liner arrived in Kazan\nHowever, as it turned out, they themselves were involved in the mass infection of tourists. Contrary to the recommendations of physicians, passengers were regularly aired on the deck and left the cabins. The other day, the first 500 lucky ones from those who behaved more carefully left the liner. Those who are still under surveillance continue their dangerous walks. And either out of stupidity, or out of ignorance, a violation of quarantine rules has already grown into an international flash mob. A week ago, two patients with suspected coronavirus did the almost impossible - they escaped from round-the-clock control at the Botkin Hospital. What exactly did not like the girls already know. They talked about this on social networks.\nAlla Ilyina, who decided to play hide and seek with the doctors of the first, does not regret her act, but considers the doctors guilty. Even after the trial, which ordered the girl to return to the ward, she stands her ground: quarantine is the same as arrest.\n“I wanted freedom, freedom is my right, there is no awareness and comprehensibility, and the point is to sit in isolation. Sit silently do not ask? Well no! I will defend my rights, ”said Alla Ilyina.\nAs a result, the girl did not find a Chinese infection, but she did not think about the consequences of the escape. In theory, such a trick could lead to another epidemic based on Wuhan. Coronavirus is transmitted four times faster than ordinary infections, and therefore four times more dangerous.\nThis Doomsday scenario is pretty simple to imagine. A zero patient who escaped from a hospital in St. Petersburg is still infected. To mark the release, he goes to the crowded streets of the evening city and even without close contacts infects hundreds of people. Those, in turn, are thousands.\nAnd in this situation, the infection will begin to be transmitted uncontrollably. Subtropics will be the first to suffer from the mild climate, and most of humanity will die in just a year. But it’s impossible to detain a zero patient according to Russian laws. The punishment for escaping from quarantine is only 500 rubles, unlike the Israeli seven years in prison.\n“We do not have the mentality that we comply with the requirements. Although we have a terrible threat. If we take the laws of the United States and Israel, they tightened it there.

Is America's scientists and intelligence behind him", "text": "Corona virus between doubt and assertion ... Are America's scientists and intelligence behind him\nThe virus, which has spread to a superpower, is noteworthy. China, which the United States fears militarily and economically and has dubbed it in its political literature as a “sleeping dragon”, is a country in which China’s experts and experts recommend: “Do not wake the dragon.”\nIt is not the habit of the United States of America to leave its opponents and those who threaten its security in peace, evidence and evidence, many of which are the American containment strategy for communism during the Cold War, and the Soviet Union is also the opponent of America, which was the cause of its collapse in 1991 AD, as well as the countries of the Middle East region that threaten the security of Israel - just from their point of view. What their literature admits - beginning with Iraq and accusing it of an American of possessing weapons of mass destruction, was the 2003 invasion, and what Syria witnessed was the strong country that Israel feared, and it was in 2011 AD and the beginning of a global war against Syria to destroy it and break up its forces, and Iran is another example in which America sees a threat To her and her allies, the sources of American exploitation, was Iran's accusation of its nuclear project on the pretext of its militarism, not its peacefulness, and much, much. From this fact, my article came to make a mathematical theory in which the assumption and demand and then the proof.\nThe hypothesis of this article states that: “The rise of China economically and militarily, and its formation as an ally of the Russian Federation and the heir to the Soviet Union in addition to North Korea in the first place and the countries of the resistance axis, China threatens American national security in one way or another, and therefore must - according to the American intelligence mentality - From a blow to China that weakens its power, and results in its generally low level of development, in order to keep the gap between China and America wide and distant, until the ghosts of fears of “the sleeping dragon” are extinct.\nFirst, it is necessary to include a list of the most important rumors about Kona virus and the standing behind it, such as the following:\nFirst: The Russian media narrative focuses on one point repeatedly, which is that western political elites, especially American ones, are behind this epidemic.\nSecond: The first Russian government channel, one of the most prominent TV channels, has allocated a fixed paragraph to address the \"Western conspiracy\" regarding the Corona virus, in the evening news program \"Time\".\nThird: Officially, China accuses America of being behind the Coruna virus and vowing to wipe Washington from the face of the earth, quoting Egypt's network now.\nIn tandem with the above, there is a question that presents itself: What are the data that suggested that the spread of Corona virus in China is a planned or a conspiracy?\nFirst: The Evidence: Russia's Submission that Corona is an ethnic biological weapon that states use against hostile peoples. One of the Russian experts during the report is that the Chinese Corona virus (“synthetic creature”), and that the pharmaceutical companies are behind this, historically known to be the United States The American was running a laboratory in Georgia, where she was testing biological weapons on humans.\nSecond, the logical evidence: the spread of Corona virus in China came at a time when China was preparing to literally invade the world with technology, industry and the terrible Chinese economy.\nAs a result, this evidence is insufficient and not convincing, but the Western, especially the American, is the biggest beneficiary, in countries that do not believe that what is happening from the epidemic is divine punishment, but rather mocks and employs this media and political, and I, as a researcher, build an opinion on the basis of the beneficiary, especially since its history is full With many such events, experiences and evidence, the most important of which is for human experimentation. Example: First: The Guatemala Project is just one of many gruesome experiments carried out in the name of medicine.\nSecond, US military doctors in the Philippines have infected five people with bubonic plague, and wounded 29 prisoners by land.\nThird: In the 1950s, in order to simulate a biological warfare attack, the US Navy sprayed large amounts of wilted Siratian bacteria - which were considered harmless at this time - over San Francisco during a project called Operation Sea Mist. Many citizens developed pneumonia-like illnesses, and at least one person died as a result.\nFourth: The San Francisco Chronicle, on December 17, 1979, wrote page 5 about the Church’s scientific claim that the CIA conducted a biological warfare experiment in the open air in 1955 near Tampa, Florida and other areas in Florida with pertussis bacteria. She claimed that the experience increased the number of whooping cough injuries by three times in Florida and injured more than a thousand cases, and this caused an increase in deaths due to whooping cough in the country from one to 12 over the previous year.\nFifth: In 1966, the US Army released Bacillus globuli to the New York City subway system as part of a field study called The Affliction of Subway Passengers in New York City Undercover Attack with Biological Agents. The Chicago subway system also underwent a similar experience by the military. There are experiences of atomic radiation and radioactive contamination.\nAnd based on these facts documented historically, I built my belief that the United States of America had planned to spread the Corona virus in China as a biological warfare that relieved it from moving any inhabitants, and its profits were invaluable at various levels.\nEven at the level of countries, there are doubts from some countries that Western countries, especially the American ones, are behind this spread of this virus in China. Here is the question: Why are their goals? What is their interest? What will America gain from weakening China?\nIn fact, the American interest lies in the same goals, namely the weakening of the Chinese economy and then the weakening of the geopolitical competitor, and here it must be noted the fallacy that: \"The goal of the pharmaceutical companies is to achieve huge profits from vaccines against the virus.\" So far, no Western party has claimed that it has treatment, but rather internal Chinese entities affiliated with the Chinese state itself. In the event that it happened and monopolized the drug in an agent abroad, but this did not happen so I called it a fallacy, launched by the friends of China.\nIn the context of the talk, the interest of the outside to weaken China has already affected it, and the manifestations of the effect of the spread of the virus on the reality and future of China, such as countries withdrawing their citizens from China, and cutting land, sea and air flights, from the closest friends to the enemies, such as Russia reducing flights and trains to China. Likewise, Iran, which reflects negatively on the Chinese economy, which disturbs the progress and development of the American competitor and his intelligence services.\nAs for the most important question, which is, what will America gain from weakening China if it is proven by the definitive evidence - that it is from me who is behind the Corna virus? The answer is as follows:\nFirst: To limit the development of Chinese military power, which, in the nature of nature, will not be able to compete with the American military force.\nSecondly, China discouraged its political stances, especially in the outstanding issues between it and America, such as the position on the Taiwan issue, and China's support for the Iranian nuclear agreement. China also rejects the idea of American domination of world affairs.\nThird: The impact on the Chinese human power, as China is the first global force in terms of human wealth, with a population of about one billion and 300 million people. China has managed, with its management of its human wealth, to achieve huge economic progress and build a military force that is the largest in the world.\nFourth: A direct blow to the human development process in China, according to (researcher Mahmoud Mohamed in his message “Dimensions of the Chinese Rise in the International System and its Repercussions 1991-2010), the Chinese government paid attention to the health of its residents. In 2006, health spending reached 3.6% of The size of the gross domestic product, and the percentage of those enrolled in basic and university education reached 70% of the total population, while the literacy rate for those over fifteen was 90.9%.\nFifth: Directing a severe blow to the development process in general Development in China has focused on three determinants: agricultural development, industrial progress, scientific and technological development. China has paid great attention to scientific and technological research so that it can achieve its aspirations and aspirations for all purposes.\nIn this regard, it must be pointed out what proves the American move against China and its necessity, namely, the strategy of containing China, which was clearly shown in an orderly manner by Condoleezza Rice since the beginning of her work as a national security advisor when she announced that China, as a growing and ambitious force, poses a challenge to vital American interests. In the Asia and other regions of the world for these reasons, Rice has called for more US support for India to maintain regional balance in Asia.\nThe result: The work to spread the Corona virus and amplify its negative effects on China is part of an American plan to hit China economically, militarily and culturally within the framework of what is today called the wars of the fourth and fifth generations; which are based on creating crises and spreading epidemics and diseases under the framework of biological wars, sowing discord and rumors The demolition of values and heritage, the demolition of society in general, and the final move away from the direct clash method, and this result has become clear and proven in light of the historical evidence of the American biological experiments, and for the American dealings with the competitors and the rising powers as well, and on this basis and by returning to the imposition In my article, the Corona virus is a form of an American strike against China in order to weaken its power and cause its level of development in general to keep the gap between China and America widening and far, until the ghosts of fears of the \"sleeping dragon\" disappear."}, {"url": "https://ednews.net/ar/news/world/421993-5", "title": "Coronary virus puzzle that slept 5 years!", "text": "The controversy over the origin of the new coronavirus (Corona) has not subsided since it broke out in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, killing thousands and wounding about a quarter of a million people around the world.\nThis controversy escalated, especially between the United States and China, to the highest levels, as US President Donald Trump described it as a Chinese virus, while Beijing suspected that he was an American.\nAlthough scientists and specialists are now busy combating this deadly epidemic, regardless of its source, and some confirm that there are no indications of its creation and that it is a \"natural\" virus known to \"lineage\", it was exposed to a mutation that turned it into a \"killer\" that has the ability to penetrate human cells, except A report published by the American journal, Nature, known for its sobriety, still threw more oil on \"conspiracy theory\" oil.\nThis report was published on November 12, 2015, and reported that US scientists have created in the laboratory a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats in connection with a virus that causes SARS, that is, acute respiratory syndrome.\nThe magazine revealed about 5 years ago that scientists had examined a virus called \"SHC014\", which was found in horseshoe bats in China.\nThese scientists combined the surface protein of \"SHC014\" with the SARS virus, and came out with a new virus that provided the surface protein with a structure that helps it penetrate into the cells of the human respiratory system.

The disease has already killed more than six thousand people in the country, with over 60 thousand people infected.\nThe EU clearly underestimated the virus, blaming the outbreak in Italy on its national healthcare system flaws, according to the two-time foreign minister and OSCE representative. As a result, Brussels, which preaches pan-European solidarity, failed to act when this solidarity was needed in the face of a crisis that eventually affected the entire bloc.\nFrankly speaking, Brussels is not doing enough.

Many said it was all because of the Italian habits, because Italians do not respect the rules. Suddenly, they realized all the other countries were equally affected.\nThe situation in other major EU states like Germany and France deteriorated rapidly, forcing them to deal with thousands of infected on their own soil.\n“Everyone just focused on the situation at home before even thinking about helping others,” Andrea Giannotti, the executive director of the Italian Institute of Eurasian Studies, told RT.\nThe lack of solidarity was recently noted from outside of the bloc – Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic decried European solidarity as a myth, while praising Beijing for its assistance. His remarks came after Serbia received five million masks from China, which it could not get in Europe.\nThe EU is now trying “to do more” and somehow “make up” for its initial poor execution of a coordinated response, former Italian MP Dario Rivolta said.\nBrussels has indeed ramped up its efforts, suspending the bloc’s strict Stability and Growth Pact regulating budgetary policy among others. Frattini particularly hailed this decision, which allows Rome to act freely in terms of budgetary spending, as “very important.” But this came only after Europe “realized its [measures] were inadequate to give a united response.”\nStill, it is not enough, Rivolta told RT, adding that “for the moment,” there are no major changes. And while financial relief is necessary, there are other things to be considered, such as medical assistance.\n“As for the medical aspects, the only thing that the EU did up to now was to put barriers between Italy and other countries.”\nAt one point, requests for help were sent out all over the world, according to Giannotti.\n“Some Italian embassies were tasked with negotiating with local governments in order to find any opportunities to receive assistance from abroad, including help with equipment, which Italy lacks.” Russia and China were among those who responded.\nIn total, Moscow prepared nine cargo planes with emergency aid, delivering vital medical equipment and supplies, as well as bringing experienced specialists in infectious diseases and military doctors to Italy. Now they will be deployed to the most affected regions in the country’s north.\nFrattini said the help was of the utmost importance: “What Russia has done is not comparable to what other countries have done, including China because China also sent something but not comparable with the support provided by Russia.”\nThe specialists have provided “very huge support in terms of expertise… in terms of virology.”\nThe assistance serves as a gesture of solidarity in times of European sanctions on Moscow and the counter-measures, Giannotti said. Sending help “despite [the fact] the situation in Russia itself may also worsen” means it is a clear message that Moscow is ready to talk and settle issues with Europe when there is a greater need for cooperation.\nSpeaking to RT, the Italian ambassador to Russia, Pasquale Terracciano, agreed that a joint approach is the best way to put an end to the pandemic.\nThanking Moscow for the contribution, he said: “It will be crucial to recover from this tragic situation, hopefully soon.”\nThink your friends would be interested?

Who and why post lies about the “epidemic” of coronavirus in Russia\nCoronavirus has become a sore subject for the whole world. As of February 6, the number of cases exceeded 28 thousand, 564 became victims, and 1153 people recovered.\nLawyer and member of the Public Chamber Ilya Remeslo noted that a lot of fakes appeared on the Internet, where the words \"coronavirus\" and \"Russia\" appeared. This is taking into account the fact that not a single Russian has yet become infected - there is not a single confirmed case. Although there are concerns, especially regarding citizens who flew from Wuhan, China, where the virus originated. They are quarantined in Tyumen.\nThe lawyer noted that the situation with the news about coronavirus in Russia resembles a story with fakes about a fire in the Winter Cherry shopping center. Then the Ukrainian pranker Yevgeny Volnov (real name Nikita Kuvikov) called the hospitals and lied that hundreds of people had died in the fire and places for corpses were needed in the morgue. Recently, \"360\" wrote about fake news that the world will remember for a long time.\nUkrainian fakes\nThe lawyer drew attention to the panic messages in several Telegram channels, which are open for comment. Moreover, the pages are focused on regions - for example, Tyumen, Kirov, Krasnodar. The lawyer was attracted by the messages of a certain Oleg Ignatenko, whose city Lviv, Ukraine is indicated in the profile. Whether he is a real person is not clear.\nThe virus has already caused serious damage to the Chinese economy, stopped the work of factories and plants, dropped the shares of local companies. And in Wuhan itself, panic.\nIgnatenko tried to instill a panic in the Russians and inadvertently wrote messages in chat rooms urging him to “get out of the city”, because he allegedly had “three acquaintances with a temperature below 40.”\nThe head of the epidemiological department of the Office of Rospotrebnadzor in the Tomsk Region, Andrei Rudikov, also said that the residents of the region received panic messages from certain intelligence officers with the content - \"they are hiding something from us.\"\nBut no one pays special attention to the black sheep in the herd; nevertheless, people need more confirmation and reliable sources. However, the problem flew into the Ukrainian media. The sites have been posting panic-causing news since January 22nd. The first was the Ukrainian Observer.\nThe Observer is not the only media panic in the Russians who accidentally fall into the article. The Ukrainian World website states: \"The Russian authorities are taking tough measures because of the Chinese coronavirus, because a large-scale pandemic could begin in the country.\" It sounds scary until you scroll down a bit, where journalists talk about coronavirus as the “causative agent of the epidemic of deadly diarrhea in piglets.”\nAnd the absurdity finishes the photo in the article, not related to the topic. On it stands a girl with folded palms, and below the inscription: \"Kill them *** (in FIG - approx. Ed.) All.\" It doesn’t sound very friendly.\nFake threw in the Ukrainian Dialog. An article appeared on the site with the headline: “The Russian Federation is sounding the alarm because of its dependence on China:“ We will fight on carts, although there is a problem - the forest has been taken out. ” And the material in question is that the Russian KamAZ plant is halting due to the Chinese coronavirus. They say that components are being brought from China, but now there is trouble. Moreover, the site refers to a certain Russian blogger with the name El Murid, who for some reason did not get this information.\nKamAZ really stopped work, but it was from December 31 to January 8 due to the New Year holidays, and then from January 9 to January 22 due to corporate leave.\nIn general, Ukrainian sites are actively throwing flashy headlines in the spirit of “Enemy at the Gates. In Russia, the coronavirus was discovered. What threatens the Ukrainians. \" This, by the way, is the title on the Strana.ua website.\nAnd the Ukrainian media “New Time” completed the fake parade. On February 5, a material appeared on the website with the headline: \"How the coronavirus infected the Russian economy.\"\nHypanut on a lie\nThe muddy wave of panic messages and outright fakes from Ukraine is not the first time affecting important events in Russia. Kiev publications and bloggers have already mocked the victims of the crash. Since shame and ordinary human empathy are unfamiliar to them, users need to remember that information can be greatly exaggerated, frankly distorted, and the numbers are overstated to unrealistic. Facts must be checked in the same way as messages about chewing gum with needles in instant messengers.\nThe most famous and professional joker of Russia, pranker Vovan, aka Vladimir Kuznetsov, suggested that not only Ukraine generates rumors and does not say so on purpose.\n“I think that when some stories appear that disturb everyone, all sorts of mentally unhealthy people live on this bad hype. Or they specifically want to do disgusting things, or just fools who have nothing to do, begin to sow panic. Constantly on WhatsApp, parents throw messages that “be careful, maniacs are catching children, they are sending to organs in China,” ”the pranker said.\nKuznetsov believes that there is no 100% panacea for fake news. When the topic is bloated, there will always be people who will believe even in the most ridiculous things.\n“If this is done intentionally in order to spread panic, and not because of stupidity, something needs to be done here. Punishment? The fine will be quite relevant. There are people who just like to rumor, scare. When it hits the wallet, they will think whether to do it [or not], ”he concluded.\nThe chairman of the OP commission on the development of the information community, the media and mass communications, the head of the National Values Protection Fund Alexander Malkevich expressed a slightly different point of view. In his opinion, the creators of fakes sow panic quite deliberately. Moreover, this is precisely what they are achieving.\n“In Ukraine there are special troll factories that have the task of destabilizing the situation in Russia as much as possible, at least in terms of social networks. In the first January days there was a fire at the Ukhta oil refinery. A number of reports were made according to the training manual that the authorities were hiding the truth, there were not enough places in the hospitals. I was pleased with the phrase: “People are stacked in piles in the corridors of the hospital and smeared with green paint,” Malkevich said.\nHe emphasized that coronavirus provides an excellent opportunity for destabilization. The messages use standard stencils: “the authorities are hiding the truth”, “my friends work in the FSB and told ...”.\nAlexander Malkevich emphasized that accounts are created specifically to launch the “bullet”.\n“This is being done as part of an informational special operation, especially since these manuals work. The “professionals\" of these informational special operations are connected simply by idiots and provincial morons who crave hype. These are the so-called Russian prankers, who are beaten up on provocations, give out little money, use it blindly, ”the chairman of the commission shared.\nHe complained that it was impossible to stop the wave of uncontrolled rumors, since there were no corresponding laws. Malkevich believes that the struggle should be waged in several directions at once.\n“The law on the dissemination of fake information, which is about to turn a year old, needs serious revision. We are ready to propose appropriate amendments. Why does this law only hit the media? The instigators need to be punished, but for them the punishment is extremely vague. It’s necessary to transfer the burden of responsibility to platforms, to intermediaries, to social networks, which must clean up fakes and extremist content on their own, ”the expert suggested.\nHe suggested repeatedly “tighten the screws”, since the pranks arranged by the provocateurs have nothing to do with freedom of speech. In relation to these scum, it is necessary to introduce multi-million fines and criminal liability.\n“We are talking exclusively about lies, throws aimed at destabilizing the situation. Not that \"I mixed up, it seemed to me.\" We are talking about fake accounts that are created deliberately, ”Malkevich emphasized."}, {"url": "https://sahafaty.com/news14040414.htm", "title": "China and Russia are doing what the European Union has failed to combat Corona", "text": "China and Russia are doing what the European Union has failed to combat Corona\nUnder the above title, Eurasia Expert published the text of a meeting with a Chinese expert on the future of the European Union after its reluctance to provide assistance to its members in facing the epidemic, and what Beijing and Moscow have done."}, {"url": "https://www.rt.com/op-ed/484609-new-zealand-coronavirus-police-state/", "title": "New Zealand becoming police state: Covid-19 lockdown to be taken seriously, but reporting neighbors & abuse of power goes too far", "text": "While slow to apprehend Covid-19 initially and taking nonsensical measures such as banning travel from Iran while allowing travel from Italy unabated, the New Zealand government quickly changed tack and announced it was implementing a four-tier threat level to deal with the virus. It wasn’t long after this that the government gave New Zealanders a two-day period for everyone to tie up loose ends and prepare for what is essentially a nationwide lockdown (threat level four), which will continue for at least four weeks.\nAs part of this, a state of emergency was declared last week which saw the powers-that-be activate emergency legislation. This current state of affairs enables New Zealand’s National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to close or restrict access to roads or public places, regulate land, water and air traffic, and even evacuate and enter people’s premises, among other measures. The New Zealand police are responsible for maintaining law and order during the state of emergency, and have been given special powers to order any person to stop any activity that contributes to the emergency. As of today, the state of emergency has been extended by another seven days.\nSo, what? I hear you ask. The Covid-19 crisis is an unprecedented situation which can lead to immense death and suffering, and has already begun undertaking that course of action in Italy, Iran, Spain and even in the US. Calling New Zealand’s response a descent into a “police state” is nothing more than a conspiracy theory, aimed at fueling and sparking more panic in an already panic-driven environment.\nWell, perhaps you might want to tell that Victoria University’s associate law professor, Dean Knight, who said that with so much discretionary power, there is a very real risk that the discretion could be used in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. Or how about University of Otago law professor, Andrew Geddis, who has questioned the current state of affairs in two separate op-eds, warning that police can use “extreme and unprecedented” powers to constrain basic freedoms of movement guaranteed by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act.\nWe could say the same of Radio New Zealand contributor Catriona MacLenna, who penned an open letter to the country’s police with the aim of making it crystal clear that “New Zealand is a democracy,” “not a police state.”\nWe might also want to tell that to journalist Damian Christie. Christie was in the process of delivering video equipment to a client’s business with a letter firmly in hand to prove that what he was doing was regarded as being part of an essential service, his client being a large food producer. Despite producing this letter (and having no discernible legal obligation to do so), a police officer who stopped him began to yell at him and flat-out ignored the letter, even though we had been told that if we provide such a letter, we won’t experience any issues. According to the officer, however, Christie should only have left his house to buy medical supplies.\nThis is clearly untrue and, as Professor Geddis notes in his columns, has created much confusion about what we can and can’t do under the lockdown rules. I agree with Geddis that if there has been an instruction given to the police to apply these powers, then we need to see those instructions.\nOn top of all of this, the government saw fit in the most Orwellian way possible to set up an online mechanism for locals to “dob in” other fellow Kiwis who were flouting the lockdown rules. Within an hour of it being launched, over-zealous New Zealanders crashed the website with over 4,200 reports lodged. Police have also arrested a number of people for breaching the lockdown rules. I expect this number to climb somewhat over the next three weeks.\nI don’t know how comfortable I am with a website where people can dob in other people without requiring any demonstrable evidence. I am also concerned as to what this precedent could achieve in the future. Perhaps the next lockdown won’t be because of Covid-19, but because of a different situation entirely. What if the next website is set up to dob in not flouters of the lockdown, but say, political dissidents?\nWe are always naive in thinking that this type of activity can never occur in New Zealand, even when the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) has been found to have spied on targets illegally; or that time the Snowden papers revealed that the GCSB was spying on the entire Pacific on a mass scale without the knowledge of its neighbors. How quickly New Zealanders seem to forget these facts, or perhaps simply turn a blind eye to them from the outset.\nThe emergence of New Zealand’s police state apparatus comes at an interesting time. The Court of Appeal just ruled last week that New Zealanders have no constitutional right to bear arms, following a failed legal challenge by the “Kiwi Party.” While denying that right, the government has been quietly rolling out an extensive armed police patrol trial which saw units deployed 75 times a day in their first five weeks (what on Earth for?)\nLook, I get it. I take the Covid-19 crisis as seriously as the next person, and for that matter, the overarching principles of the lockdown requirements. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t question power and the abuse of that power, even during a national and global state of emergency.\nAs Benjamin Franklin’s old adage goes: “Those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.” And they’ll probably end up losing both.\nThink your friends would be interested?

Unfortunately, I have no doubt about that. It has an artificial origin, like this information channel that has been raised around it.\n- But in this case, who do you see as possible coroners in the coronavirus as a biological weapon? What are the indirect signs and evidence?\n- Let's say that VeteransToday, the website of the US Army and Intelligence Veterans (not only that, but it is more systematic) has been talking about this version for a long time. Moreover, this portal cites documents that the development of COVID-19 was completed in 2015. One of the centers where the secret laboratories were located was based in North Carolina, the other in Harvard, and the third in Arkansas. According to U.S. intelligence veterans, attempts to inspect the new home have been made in the United Kingdom (including the University of Cambridge), where it was funded by the Bill Gates Foundation, as well as in Australia and Canada. Moreover, some components have been tested in biological laboratories in Georgia and Ukraine. According to the source, such a thing, most likely, took place at the Institute of Virology in the city of Wuhan, which, by the way, was funded by Soros, where he later became the epicenter of the infection. Although this is another question. Can it be epicenter? There is evidence that one of the American doctors suffered from coronavirus in November 2019, and it happened in the United States even before they discovered this infection in China.\n(Quoted from VeteransToday. \"... There is considerable indirect evidence that this COVID-19 epidemic was a biological weapon that was deployed mainly against China and Iran, but\" countered \"its creators. Traditionally, experimentalists were skeptical of biological warfare. just because it tends to \"jump\", hit on its own and create returns \".\n- And who can be the customer of such a large-scale work?\n- Former Microsoft CEO and one of the richest people on the planet (from 2009 to 2016, the richest, according to Forbes), Bill Gates, the so-called benefactor George Soros. Keep in mind that Gates is a great friend of the Democratic Party of the United States and the main sponsor of the Clinton clan (the so-called Clintonites). In addition, what I call the \"deep state\" with its center in London is closely linked to the two.

The article citing the report claims that the goal of the evil Russians is to spread panic and fear among EU citizens and undermine the EU unity and solidarity (like it has ever existed).

It’s just that the club of countries from which the advanced Western world (and its satellites) are demanding trillions of dollars in the form of compensation and reparations has suddenly expanded - and now Russia is in it together with China, from which trillions of dollars are already beginning to be claimed as compensation for economic damage, as well as human lives carried away by the coronavirus, which Donald Trump specifically and consistently calls \"Chinese.\"\nThe essence of the accusations boils down to the following (pseudo) argument, which can be schematically formulated as follows: “If China had told Western countries in time that a new terrible virus had been found, then the countries of the civilized West would have prepared and there would have been no epidemic. But China hid everything, truth-doctors” censored, and in general he now has to answer for all the economic damage and the lost lives of Westerners who died due to the actions of Beijing. \"\nThe demand is obviously absurd, but you need to be very naive (and it’s bad to know the specifics of the thinking of our Western partners) in order to think that this absurdity (not to mention image considerations) will stop attempts to force China to pay and repent.\nOne of the leading British newspapers, The Daily Mail, in its Sunday edition of Mail on Sunday, outlines the goals and methods of fighting for Chinese money: \"China owes us 351 billion pounds (433 billion US dollars. - Ed.). Britain should pursue Beijing through international courts (to obtain. - Ed.) Compensation for coronavirus, serious researchers say. Fifteen influential members of the Conservative Party urge to \"reconsider\" UK relations with China. <...> Since the beginning of the epidemic, the world's leading economies post Adali 3.2 trillion pounds (3.95 trillion US dollars -.. Ed.). Research shows that this could have been avoided if China was more honest. \"\nThe authoritative study referenced by Mail on Sunday is the “investigation” of the Henry Jackson Society think tank, which blames the Chinese government for the epidemic.\nThe project of the American agency Bloomberg publishes a detailed study of the legal prospects of lawsuits against Beijing in international courts from a practicing lawyer specializing in such cases, who dryly states that the process has already begun, and in the most literal sense: \"Two class action lawsuits were filed in the United States alone. against China for suppressing information about the virus at an early stage (epidemic. - Approx. ed.) and receiving billions (dollars. - Approx. ed.) as compensation for damage caused by an outbreak of coronavirus. \"\nIf this continues, then similar claims will be filed not only in the US, but also in various European and international courts.\nBearing in mind how the current US presidential administration relates to China and the “Chinese threat,” it can be assumed that such actions will receive maximum political support, especially given that blaming their own mistakes on the actions of an external enemy is a well-known political tactic that Americans (and not only them) have successfully used in relation to Russia (and not only it).\nBy the way, Russian experience shows that the obvious legal nullity of such accusations will not affect the judicial prospects of such claims at all (we have already done this several times), not to mention the fact that the British government can successfully use its secret weapon against Beijing, nullifying any tactics of defense from the point of view of the British.\nThis weapon is a combat “highly likly” (“very likely”), the very magical formulation that frees our London geopolitical opponents from the need to provide any sane evidence of Russian guilt in those crimes that Moscow is accused of.\nThere is no need to experience illusions: for China, in the West they have already found (or will very soon find) their \"Chinese Browder\", and \"Chinese Khodorkovsky\", and even real victims of the epidemic, as well as Chinese doctors from Wuhan, who suffered from regional Chinese mistakes officials. And they will be rather cynically \"posthumously\" used to shake trillions of living dollars from living Chinese.\nHowever, the chances of actually getting these trillions from Beijing are illusory. But the point is not this, but to save ordinary citizens of the European Union or the United States from dissatisfaction that the epidemic in the Western world has acquired catastrophic proportions with catastrophic economic consequences. Despite all the media efforts, it is unlikely that ordinary Europeans and Americans will be able to convince that the cause of all the problems is the alleged Chinese secrecy.\nHowever, these same inhabitants watched for several weeks in the Western media reports on what measures the PRC government is taking to combat the epidemic, including blocked housing complexes, food delivery on drones, mass testing, stopping enterprises and even dug roads between the regions, protected by police . All this was presented as evidence of the \"authoritarianism\" and irrationality of the Beijing authorities.\nBut now, pointing to the same reports, one can ask the plaintiffs about what other obvious and shocking actions (not statements, namely actions) should have been taken so that Boris Johnson and Donald Trump believe that this is a serious matter. Even as a public relations campaign, all claims against China will be a rather futile undertaking, but as an excuse for introducing anti-Chinese economic sanctions, they are perfect.\nActually, for these sanctions, everything is likely to be conceived.\n* The opinion of the author may not coincide with the position of the publisher\nRead the original material at RIA Novosti"}, {"url": "https://kol-masr.com/mixtoday/uncategorized/47605/%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%B3%D8%B1-%D9%88%D9%82%D9%88%D8%B9-%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D8%B9%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%AE%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%B6-40%D8%9F", "title": "Corona ...

From this fact, my article came to create a mathematical theory in which there is imposition and demand and then proof.\nBased on the foregoing, the hypothesis of this article states the following: “The rise of China economically and militarily, and its formation as an ally of the Russian Federation and the heir to the Soviet Union in addition to North Korea in the first place and the countries of the resistance axis, China threatens US national security in one way or another, and therefore must - According to the American intelligence mentality - from striking a blow that weakens its power to China and causes its overall level of development to decline, in order to keep the gap between China and America widening and far, until the ghosts of fears of the \"sleeping dragon\" are extinct. This hypothesis needs to be investigated in order for us to prove it or deny it.\nFirst, it is necessary to include a list of the most important rumors about Kona virus and the standing behind it, such as the following:\nFirst: The Russian media narrative focuses on one point repeatedly, which is that western political elites, especially American ones, are behind this epidemic.\nSecond: The first Russian government channel, one of the most prominent TV channels, is to allocate a fixed paragraph to address the \"Western conspiracy\" about the Corona virus, in the evening news program \"Time\".\nThird: Officially, China accuses America of being behind the Coruna virus and vowing to wipe Washington from the face of the earth, quoting Egypt's network now.\nIn tandem with the above, there is a question that presents itself: What are the data that suggested that the spread of Corona virus in China is a planned or a conspiracy?\nFirst: The Evidence: Russia's Submission that Corona is an ethnic biological weapon that states use against hostile peoples. One of the Russian experts during the report is that the Chinese Corona virus (“synthetic creature”), and that the pharmaceutical companies are behind this, historically known to be the United States The American was running a laboratory in Georgia, where she was testing biological weapons on humans.\nSecond, the logical evidence: the spread of Corona virus in China came at a time when China was preparing to literally invade the world with technology, industry and the terrible Chinese economy.\nAs a result, this evidence is insufficient and not convincing, but the Western, especially the American, is the biggest beneficiary, in countries that do not believe that what is happening from the epidemic is divine punishment, but rather mocks and employs this media and political, and I, as a researcher, build an opinion on the basis of the beneficiary, especially since its history is full With many such events, experiences and evidence, the most important of which is for human experimentation. Example: First: The Guatemala Project is just one of many gruesome experiments carried out in the name of medicine.\nSecond, US military doctors in the Philippines have infected five people with bubonic plague, and wounded 29 prisoners by land.\nThird: In the 1950s, in order to simulate a biological warfare attack, the US Navy sprayed large amounts of wilted Siratian bacteria - which were considered harmless at this time - over San Francisco during a project called Operation Sea Mist. Many citizens developed pneumonia-like illnesses, and at least one person died as a result.\nFourth: The San Francisco Chronicle, on December 17, 1979, wrote page 5 about the Church’s scientific claim that the CIA conducted a biological warfare experiment in the open air in 1955 near Tampa, Florida and other areas in Florida with pertussis bacteria. She claimed that the experience increased the number of whooping cough injuries by three times in Florida and injured more than a thousand cases, and this caused an increase in deaths due to whooping cough in the country from one to 12 over the previous year.\nFifth: In 1966, the US Army released Bacillus globuli to the New York City subway system as part of a field study called The Affliction of Subway Passengers in New York City Undercover Attack with Biological Agents. The Chicago subway system also underwent a similar experience by the military. There are experiences of atomic radiation and radioactive contamination.\nAnd based on these facts documented historically, I built my belief that the United States of America had planned to spread the Corona virus in China as a biological warfare that relieved it from moving any inhabitants, and its profits were invaluable at various levels.\nEven at the level of countries, there are doubts from some countries that Western countries, especially the American ones, are behind this spread of this virus in China. Here is the question: Why are their goals? What is their interest? What will America gain from weakening China?\nIn fact, the American interest lies in the same goals, namely the weakening of the Chinese economy and then the weakening of the geopolitical competitor, and here it must be noted the fallacy that: “The goal of pharmaceutical companies is to achieve huge profits from vaccines against the virus.” So far, no Western party has claimed that it has treatment, but rather internal Chinese entities affiliated with the Chinese state itself. In the event that it happened and monopolized the drug in an agent abroad, but this did not happen so I called it a fallacy, launched by the friends of China.\nIn the context of the talk, the interest of the outside to weaken China has already affected it, and the manifestations of the effect of the spread of the virus on the reality and future of China, such as countries withdrawing their citizens from China, and cutting land, sea and air flights, from the closest friends to the enemies, such as Russia reducing flights and trains to China. Likewise, Iran, which reflects negatively on the Chinese economy, which disturbs the progress and development of the American competitor and his intelligence services.\nAs for the most important question, which is, what will America gain from weakening China if it is proven by the definitive evidence - that it is from me who is behind the Corna virus? The answer is as follows:\nFirst: To limit the development of Chinese military power, which, in the nature of nature, will not be able to compete with the American military force.\nSecondly, China discouraged its political stances, especially in the outstanding issues between it and America, such as the position on the Taiwan issue, and China's support for the Iranian nuclear agreement. China also rejects the idea of American domination of world affairs.\nThird: The impact on the Chinese human power, as China is the first global force in terms of human wealth, with a population of about one billion and 300 million people. China has managed, with its management of its human wealth, to achieve huge economic progress and build a military force that is the largest in the world.\nFourth: A direct blow to the human development process in China, according to (researcher Mahmoud Mohamed in his message “Dimensions of the Chinese Rise in the International System and its Repercussions 1991-2010), the Chinese government paid attention to the health of its residents. In 2006, health spending reached 3.6% of The size of the gross domestic product, and the percentage of those enrolled in basic and university education reached 70% of the total population, while the literacy rate for those over fifteen was 90.9%.\nFifth: Directing a severe blow to the development process in general Development in China has focused on three determinants: agricultural development, industrial progress, scientific and technological development. China has paid great attention to scientific and technological research so that it can achieve its aspirations and aspirations for all purposes.\nIn this regard, it must be pointed out what proves the American move against China and its necessity, namely, the strategy of containing China, which was clearly shown in an orderly manner by Condoleezza Rice since the beginning of her work as a national security advisor when she announced that China, as a growing and ambitious force, poses a challenge to vital American interests. In the Asia and other regions of the world for these reasons, Rice has called for more US support for India to maintain regional balance in Asia.\nThe result: The work to spread the Corona virus and amplify its negative effects on China is part of an American plan to hit China economically, militarily and culturally within the framework of what is today called the wars of the fourth and fifth generations; which are based on creating crises and spreading epidemics and diseases under the framework of biological wars, sowing discord and rumors The demolition of values and heritage, the demolition of society in general, and the final move away from the direct clash method, and this result has become clear and proven in light of the historical evidence of the American biological experiments, and for the American dealings with the competitors and the rising powers as well, and on this basis and by returning to the imposition In my article, the Corona virus is a form of an American strike against China in order to weaken its power and cause its level of development in general to keep the gap between China and America widening and far, until the ghosts of fears of the \"sleeping dragon\" disappear.\nSyrian writer\nDoctor of Political Science"}, {"url": "http://geworld.ge/ge/%E1%83%99%E1%83%9D%E1%83%A0%E1%83%9D%E1%83%9C%E1%83%90%E1%83%95%E1%83%98%E1%83%A0%E1%83%A3%E1%83%A1%E1%83%98-%E1%83%AA%E1%83%95%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-%E1%83%9B%E1%83%A1%E1%83%9D%E1%83%A4%E1%83%9A/", "title": "Coronavirus changes the world order", "text": "Coronavirus, which has spread around the world, has overshadowed all other events. Now there is nothing important for humanity in the fight against Coronavirus. There is talk of all sorts of pandemics all around, but, despite the universal measures, there is no effective cure for this deadly virus.\nAccording to the World Health Organization on April 4, 1,133,453 people were infected in 200 countries, recovered 236,000, and 60,379 died. It is noteworthy that patients die not from the virus but from complications caused by it. The lethality is on average 4.7%, because it varies from country to country. If the death rate in the United States is 1.8%, in China the figure is 4%, in Italy - 11%, and in Georgia (as well as in Lebanon, Somalia, Central Africa) until April 4. Accounted for. On April 4, an elderly woman died of the virus.\nIn most infected people, the disease is mild, and the virus itself is not a strange and mysterious beast. People have been infected with coronavirus before - in 2002 and 2015.\nInformation for judgment\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the flu kills 650,000 people worldwide each year. Whether the death toll from Coronavirus will reach 650,000 is unknown, but nothing unusual is happening. The measles epidemic has had far-reaching consequences.\nIn 2009, H1N1 swine flu raged in about 200 countries, killing 1,632,258 people and killing 284,500. The mortality rate was 17.4%. Today, even in Italy, the mortality rate is lower. The peak of the epidemic is ahead, but, first of all, unlike Europe and the United States, East Asian countries - China, South Korea, Japan - have been able to stop the spread of the disease; Second: Did anyone declare a pandemic in 2009, impose quarantine (similar to 2020), sow panic? Nothing like that happened. Has anyone wanted to scare the world into forgetting everything except Coronavirus?\nCoronavirus also has its advantages, even though many have turned a blind eye to the arrangement of the modern world. Koronavirus showed everyone that the West is not a promised country with a perfect organization of life, high culture and developed civilization. Since the level of civilization is determined not by always smiling, whether you have a reason for it, but by the level of development, the diverse forms of socio-economic life, and not by the facades of hospitals and polyclinics.\nAnd what do we see today? Medicine, which has been hailed by rating agencies as \"the best in the world\", is powerless to fight viral infections. The state cannot ensure order and security. Attacks on pharmacies and stores in Italy have become commonplace. In England, insurance companies are not fulfilling their obligations, medical insurance has been canceled, the test to detect coronavirus costs 450 450. In Spain, swindlers have become more active, speculating on currency, masks, tests, and drugs. In Belgium and the Netherlands, people have lost their faces and claim that older people should not be hospitalized and that \"natural selection has already been established\":\n\"Don't bring weak patients and older people to the hospital. We will not be able to do more for them than the palliative care they already receive in nursing homes. It is inhumane to invite them to the hospital to die ”(Nele van den Nor Norgate, Head of the Hospital's Department of Geriatrics (Gerontology)). Nobody blames Crint for such solidarity between the EU member states (middle-aged and older citizens of Georgia remember what real union was like).\nThe West is proud of democracy, pragmatism, individualism, but does not realize that all this is permissible when everything is in order and there is no problem, but it is completely useless when it is necessary to mobilize the people, when the state must become one mechanism. China is now showing the world such a model of state organization.\nWhen comparing the situation in the EU and China according to the consequences of the epidemic, many recognize China’s superiority, including the organization of Chinese healthcare. China has already announced the end of quarantine. \"It's an epidemic,\" wrote Zhenmin Zhibao. And indeed it is. While the EU is discussing \"mutual assistance\" and each is only trying to figure out how to benefit from the infection, China has joined forces with the efforts of its political leaders. The same Genemin Gibao writes that the Chinese system is based on \"the will of the people, the protection of rights and interests, the promotion of innovation and the vitality of the people.\" Many may remember the Soviet-era \"people and party are united!\"\nA long time ago we laughed at our slogans and aspirations and greedily stared at the West. Isn't it time to take a closer look at the East?\nHistory is full of examples.\nRecall the explosion of the black flower in 1959-1960. In December 1959, artist-graphic artist Alexei Kokorekin was on a business trip to India, where he attended the funeral of Bramini, who died of unknown causes, bought a carpet for the deceased and brought it to Moscow. A few days later, Kokorekin was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of severe influenza. The artist died at the hospital, and before his death his body was covered with ulcers. Soon similar symptoms appeared in his neighbor's ward. Only in the first days of the 1960s were doctors able to diagnose a dead artist VARIOLA VERA, and this is not coronavirus. Kokorekin transmitted the disease to 46 people, and not so much that the artist struck someone in the nose. The virus entered the ward above Kokorekin through a ventilation tube. The registrar's wife was called by the doctor on the phone, and another employee fell ill and accidentally went to Kokorekin's ward. VARIOLA VERA However, we should be really afraid of flowers. The flower was planted by doctors, security officials and government officials.\nAnother example is the 1970 cholera epidemic. The disease quickly spread to the Black and Caspian Seas. As soon as the cases of cholera were confirmed, several cities were closed (including Tbilisi - GG). Hundreds of kilometers away, even in the Moscow region, the access to the reservoirs was blocked. In the cities where the patients were staying, doctors began to visit the apartments, check and identify people with symptoms of the disease. Cholera disappeared in early September, a month later. And again no panic, no excitement, most of the citizens didn’t even notice about this very dangerous disease, as in the case of the flower. The epidemic was stopped in the shortest possible time, the mortality rate was 1%, and when the state does not intervene, about 60-70 percent of cases of this disease end in death.\nWhat do the examples show? Human life is not just about shopping, dancing and hitchhiking (traveling by car). It is, at the same time, a daily life, of successes and failures, of destructions and emergencies that are best dealt with by a solidary society with centralized governance, such as the Soviet Union that China aspires to today.\nAnother finding is that medicine, which was transferred from the Soviet Union to its former subjects, including Georgia, is better than Western medicine, and the transformation of the current health care system into a Western one would be an attack on people's health. Yes, Georgians with money, as well as Russians, Ukrainians, Azerbaijanis or others love to go to the West for treatment, but the question is, do they serve there as the richest people in the world? In addition, many of them, as well as, for example, not all Germans, can seek medical help at the Sharita Clinic or the Rex Der Isar (the best medical facilities in Berlin and Munich).\nAfter the end of the pandemic, world order will no longer be as it is today. It will change. Those who are strong will survive, and they will establish their order. According to UN estimates, the OVID-19 pandemic will have an \"unprecedented economic impact\" on weakly developed countries, and will require $ 2.5 trillion to eliminate the effects of the impact. Someone, like during the war, is suffering from a pandemic, while someone is having an unfavorable time.\nThose who endure the first test, those who suffer less than others, will take part in defining the new world order.\nAccording to the material published on Fondsk.ru, Giorgi Gachechiladze prepared it"}, {"url": "http://barqnewskw.com/news/page/161216", "title": "Disclosure of a US report published in 2015 throws oil on the fire of \"conspiracy theory\"", "text": "- Main\n- International\n- Sports\n- Technology news\n- Localities\n- Health\n- the art\n- Economy\n- Articles by Raya\n- The municipalities of the municipality shut down 10 violating shops in the capital and Ahmadi\n- Localities of the Ministry of Health periodic press conference to announce the latest developments in the Corona virus\nAirbus Middle East: $ 522 million in losses due to the Corona virus crisis\nAirbus Middle East: $ 522 million in losses due to the Corona virus crisis\nA breakaway Middle East from Pyongyang: Kim cannot stand or walk\nEurope \"barbeque\" relieves British captain of a British submarine from office\nMiddle East Bahrain: 58 new cases of coronavirus recorded, 60 recovered\n- The National Assembly of Al-Azmi asks Al-Aqil about the reasons for dissolving the “Fahd Al-Ahmad cooperative” administration.\nEurope Europe oscillates between being wary of a new wave of Covid-19 and the need to revitalize the economy\n- The stock market closes its trading on the rise of the general index\nAl-Ghanem: I received an invitation to attend an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Ministers headed by His Highness\nInterior Minister: With the imposition of a partial curfew, there may be some errors ...

This controversy escalated, especially between the United States and China, to the highest levels, as US President Donald Trump described it as a Chinese virus, while Beijing suspected that he was an American. Although scientists and specialists are now busy combating this deadly epidemic, regardless of its source, and some confirm that there are no indications of its creation and that it is a \"natural\" virus known to \"lineage\", it was exposed to a mutation that turned it into a \"killer\" that has the ability to penetrate human cells, except A report published by the American journal, Nature, known for its sobriety, still threw more oil on \"conspiracy theory\" oil. This report was published on November 12, 2015, and reported that US scientists have created in the laboratory a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats in connection with a virus that causes SARS, that is, acute respiratory syndrome. The magazine revealed about 5 years ago that scientists had examined a virus called \"SHC014\", which was found in horseshoe bats in China. These scientists combined the surface protein of \"SHC014\" with the SARS virus, and came out with a new virus that provided the surface protein with a structure that helps it penetrate into the cells of the human respiratory system. It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it. In this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans. Researchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, \"may be more common than previously thought.\" In contrast, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify \"potential risks\". Simon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on the news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: \"If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.\" In October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on \"job promotion\", especially those causing serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans."}, {"url": "https://arabic.sputniknews.com/radio_between_the_lines/202003151044873136-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%81-%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%81-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%9F/", "title": "What is the truth behind the existence of a biological war behind \"Corona\"?", "text": "In response, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter, \"As Khamenei knows, the best biological defense is to tell the Iranian people the truth about the Wuhan virus, and to keep Mahan flights coming and leaving the epidemic center in China, and imprison those who disclose.\"\nCommenting on this, Imad Abshanes, the Iranian political analyst, said, \"There is a lot of evidence confirming the existence of a bacterial campaign on Iran by the United States after China, the most important of which is that the type of virus circulating in Iran is different from the Koruna of China, as well as the continued American economic sanctions on Iran, Not to allow it to purchase virus detectors, to keep banking channels closed, and to prevent the export of sterilizers more than 20 meters to Iran. ”\nOn the responsibility of the Iranian authorities to continue flying flights with China despite the emergence of the disease, Absence considered in his talk with the program \"Between the Lines\" that what is raised in this matter is a big lie, promoted by the United States allies, especially as the Corona virus that appeared in China infects genes Especially Chinese and does not affect the other genes, while the Iranian Corona works on the Iranian genes, for example the Indian genes are not affected by the Corna virus found in China and Iran, and those who have transmitted the virus in European countries have genes similar to the Iranians and the Chinese - according to him -.\nIn Beijing, Chinese government spokesman Zhao Li Jian said in his Twitter account that the US military may have brought the Corona virus to the Chinese city of Wuhan, which was hardest hit by the outbreak ..

THIS is why China is succeeding in war on Covid-19 and US is on path to disaster", "text": "The pandemic has a clear global course. Despite the coronavirus outbreak beginning in China, Beijing has brought it rapidly under control – the number of domestically transmitted cases was reduced to virtually zero by the end of March. In the US and Western Europe, on the contrary, the number of cases is rising vertiginously with no peak in sight.\nIn absolute terms, the number of US and Italian coronavirus cases is already greater than China’s. But comparisons in absolute numbers greatly understate the severity of the coronavirus crisis in the US and Western Europe – due to their populations being far smaller than China. In reality, the relative severity of the US and Western European coronavirus pandemic is already far worse than at the worst point of the crisis in China and is still rising. This disastrous US and Western European failure will be more severe than the international financial crisis and will have profound geopolitical consequences.\nTwo key issues immediately follow from China’s success – how did China achieve this, and what is its international impact?\nTechnically, China’s means of controlling the coronavirus were not unknown – quarantines, deliveries of essentials to homes to allow the population to stay indoors, compulsory mask wearing, testing, transfer of medical personnel to affected areas. China certainly implemented these far more rigorously than the US and Western Europe. But behind that technical difference was a clear understanding of society by China.\nThe most fundamental issue was that China started from a real understanding of human rights as they affect the real lives of people – not the artificial constructs of Western, purely formal ‘human rights.’ In a lethal epidemic, the key human right is to stay alive.\nMore generally, for real human beings, the most fundamental issue in your life is not whether you can use Facebook, or cast a vote for a politician who promises one thing at an election and then does something completely different after it in a system which gives no real control over them, but the real ability to stay alive when faced with a deadly threat, and to have a decent and rising standard of living, to have health care, to have education, and innumerable other real concerns of people.\nWithin that context, the struggle against the coronavirus was on such a scale that it had to be carried out as a war – in China, it is frequently referred to as a ‘People’s War’ against the virus.\nThis explains China’s measures. Its strategy was strictly logical once this starting point was understood. Above all, it was necessary to do everything possible to confine the virus to Wuhan and Hubei – if it had spread throughout China it would have been impossible to control. Therefore, the first decisive measure was strict travel restrictions.\nIf people had been allowed to leave Wuhan/Hubei, overwhelming numbers would have fled with the virus spreading uncontrollably throughout China – this is precisely what is occurring in the US or Spain where people fleeing infection centers such as New York or Madrid are spreading the virus.\nThere is no doubt this caused tremendous suffering in Wuhan/Hubei. By preventing people from leaving, this placed inconceivable pressure on Hubei’s health system. China poured tens of thousands of medical staff into Hubei but this necessarily took time.\nIt may be compared to one of the greatest battles in Soviet history – Stalingrad. There, it was vitally necessary for the defenders within Stalingrad to tie the German Army down in combat within the city itself while the Soviet Army prepared the encirclement which finally smashed the Nazis to pieces. The result was that Soviet casualties within Stalingrad itself were terrible – the city’s defenders gave their lives to ensure the Soviet people’s decisive victory. In a parallel manner, people in Wuhan gave their lives to protect the people of the whole of China. Hubei and Wuhan’s medical staff are rightly regarded as heroes of the Chinese people.\nOnce the decisive task of preventing the virus’ spread had been achieved, then China could put pressure on the virus in Hubei and finally Wuhan. I have good friends in Wuhan. I know the people understood this national strategy despite the intense suffering it meant in Wuhan.\nBut what was the response of the so called ‘human rights’ organizations in the West to this? Total and criminal condemnation of China’s successful strategy!\nKenneth Roth, executive director of ‘Human Rights Watch,’ declared: “In typical Chinese Communist Party fashion, Beijing confines 35 million people rather than pursuing the transparent and targeted approach to the Wuhan coronavirus that public health and human rights require.” The Guardian in Britain published article after article attacking China’s methods of dealing with the virus before finally admitting on March 20, almost two months after China started its decisive actions: “Rigid travel restrictions and social distancing requirements appear to have had their desired effect.”\nJoshua Wong, a supporter of the Hong Kong rioters, called for the WHO director general’s resignation because the organization supported China’s successful strategy.\nBy the end of March, most of the world recognized that China had been correct. For example, a recent column on Bloomberg in the US had the self-evident headline: “The rest of the world is falling in step with Beijing’s way of fighting the coronavirus.”\n“Had China not imposed such steps, one simulation suggests there could have been eight million cases by February… In fact, each government seems to be reinventing the wheel, though events eventually force them to take China’s path: closing schools and public places, shutting borders, imposing curfews, inhibiting movement,” the column read.\nIf the advice of Roth, the Guardian, or Wong had been taken, by now thousands more people, more probably tens of thousands, would be dead.\nThis wrong approach in the West has now created a disaster in the US and Western Europe. The catastrophic scale of this is simply disguised by making comparisons in terms of absolute numbers between China and individual Western countries. This conceals the fact that the impact of the coronavirus epidemic in Western countries is many times greater than during the worst period in China – because China’s population is far larger than any Western country – more than four times that of the US and 23 times Italy’s.\nSo, for example, WHO data for March 28 shows the US had 16,894 new daily coronavirus cases – 4.3 times as high as China’s worst daily peak of 3,887. But China’s population is 4.25 times that of the US. So, in proportion to China’s population, the US figures are equal to 71,799 (16,894 x 4.25). The relative intensity of the impact of the coronavirus in the US is therefore already more than 18 times as great as the worst day in China! And the number of daily cases in the US is on a strongly rising upward curve. A literal catastrophe is unfolding in the US.\nTo understand the impact of this, US troops abroad have many times suffered severe war casualties – World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq. But only twice in American history have there been mass death events on US soil itself – the Civil War and 1918-19’s Spanish flu epidemic. Unless there is a dramatic, and unlikely, change in US policy within days, there will be the third mass death event in the US. This will necessarily hammer the US economy with a downturn worse than the international financial crisis.\nThe geopolitical consequences of this situation are both immediate and long term. In the short term, so far, the coronavirus has only hit three regions with mass force – China, the US, and Western Europe. Countries in other regions will feel its full force in the coming weeks. They can either attempt to follow the successful path of China or they can follow the disastrous one of the US.\nFurthermore China, the world’s greatest manufacturer, can be of decisive practical aid to them. Such a simple fact as that France can order one billion facemasks from China shows what is possible. The nonsense of the formal Western concept of human rights will be demonstrated to billions of people. This will inevitably produce a geopolitical shift in China’s favor.\nHow deep the longer-term geopolitical consequences will be depends on how long the US continues on its present catastrophic course. It is now impossible for the US to avoid a severe recession – certainly the sharpest decline in output since the Great Depression and possibly worse. How quickly the US economy can recover depends on how rapidly it can solve its medical crisis. But to achieve this means, for the reasons already given, the US abandoning its totally false concept of human rights, its subordination of human lives to the economy and, in essence, admitting that China was correct. Such a tremendous shift is unlikely to come nearly fast enough in a pandemic in which literally every day counts.\nIn the last 12 years, the world has passed through two huge global tests – the international financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. In both, China has far outperformed the US. This will necessarily lead to a major shift in geopolitics in favor of China. The longer the US continues with its present disastrous response to the coronavirus, the greater that shift will be.\nThink your friends would be interested?

The number of troops involved is about 37,000 soldiers, with 20,000 being soldiers of the US Armed Forces deployed here across the Atlantic.\nIvan Popel is sure that the maneuvers are fraught with incredible threat: a huge, constantly moving military group can accelerate the spread of the epidemic, even more so that it does not even require a human being.\nThe expert points out that the carrier of the virus may even be a military vehicle that contains dust particles containing the virus.\nThat's why [the spread of the coronavirus] is unnecessary, \"says Ashes. “Look at what's happening in Italy, which has become the outbreak of the coronavirus.

For the most part, these findings are disappointing for countries that have imagined themselves to be the center of a unipolar world. The experience of combating the spread of coronavirus has shown that NATO countries will not only lose global competition, but also bite themselves together in the event of a serious external threat. The analytical portal RuBaltic.Ru made three key conclusions for world politics from the history of coronavirus.\n1. US will betray Europe at the earliest opportunity\nUS President Donald Trump for a month banned entry into America from Europe. The ban applies to residents of all EU countries.\nAt the same time, the Trump’s “black list” is demonstratively absent from the United Kingdom, although it did not manage to take control of the spread of infection and the number of infected people is much higher than in most EU countries. The White House seemed to make it clear that after Brexit, the Americans have a special relationship with the Anglo-Saxon brothers.\nAnd all other Europeans, let them not appear overseas for at least a month.\nThe obvious attack of the US president against continental Europe outraged Brussels. The European Commission and the European Council in a joint statement condemned the American leader for his unilateral decision to close the entrance to the United States without consulting with allies in the Old World.\nHowever, Trump has European condemnations, indignation and statements that the elephant is grave. He has a presidential election in a few months, and the White House owner is now making all decisions in the logic of his re-election. Trump feels the voter and understands that the Americans should like the categorical decision to slap off their shoulders and ban entry into America for all the \"plagued\" Europe.\nIn a situation of real threat, non-existent transatlantic solidarity disappears even as a fiction: America makes it clear that it will betray Europe at the first danger.\nMoreover, no exceptions are made even for the so-called “good allies”, to which Donald Trump refers, for example, Poland. US satellites in Eastern Europe are denied entry to America in the same way as Germans or French who do not want to spend 2% of GDP on military spending, dare to object to Washington and try to work with Moscow.\nIn countries of the anti-Russian “buffer zone”, the distribution of coronavirus is many times less than in Italy or Spain; they are fighting the infection there, as one might suppose, more efficiently; they did not give the Americans any reason to punish themselves, however America is still closed from them because of their belonging to Europe.\nThe Americans announced the reduction of their participation in NATO exercises Defender Europe 2020 before the Europeans.\nWhether the USA will defend the Baltic states in the event of military aggression with such behavior is a rhetorical question.\n2. The EU will fall apart: its members will save themselves, not each other\nMedia sources report growing indignation of the Italian authorities about the behavior of European allies. Italy is fighting the epidemic of coronavirus alone. Other EU countries do not go to her aid and do not even offer support. The most symbolic campaign of solidarity with Italians at the European level - and there is none.\nWhen it came to great trouble, the Europeans “scored” on European solidarity, just like Donald Trump on the transatlantic, and rushed to survive each alone. According to the principle of \"saving the drowning people, the work of the drowning people themselves\"\nAnd without that, the deep split between the EU member states after the history of the coronavirus will become much deeper.\nIn 2015, the founding countries of the European Union were deeply outraged by the egoism of the new member states, which for many years received subsidies to bridge the gap with the rich countries - donors of European integration, and then refused to help them resolve the migration crisis and host part of those who fell on Western Europe refugees. Several years have passed, and now all the EU countries that strictly save themselves behave in Eastern European fashion. From Lithuania to Portugal, the slogan “my hut from the edge” prevailed.\nEuropean solidarity turned out to be an amazing thing, which turns on when EU countries need to get subsidies or sell them off migrants, and turn off when they need to help their more distressed neighbors fight coronavirus.\nThe value of European integration after such a discovery will fade greatly: in the worst case scenario, the European Union will simply crumble.\nThe previous big crisis in Europe - the migration - has already brought Eurosceptics to power in many EU countries and pushed Britain to exit. Including Brussels' radical opponents - the \"League of the North\" Matteo Salvini - came to power in Italy.\nAfter the current crisis around the coronavirus, when 60 million Italians see how the EU allies left them to survive alone, and remember the solidarity only when they subsidize Eastern Europe in Brussels, another donor country in the European Union may become smaller.\n3. Russia and China were more successful than the US and Europe\nA new type of coronavirus COVID-19 appeared in China, but it became a global threat due to Europeans. In China itself, they quickly and correctly assessed the scale of the problem and took adequate measures just as quickly. As a result, the new virus was able to be localized by the region of its origin, the number of cases fell into decline, and the main threat to the new infection for the Chinese is now not compatriots, but foreigners.\nWhen the coronavirus arrived in Europe, local politicians, experts, and other opinion leaders scornfully dismissed the alarmists with the words \"they die more often from the usual flu.\" Virality — the rate at which a new virus spread — was ignored. The mortality rate among older people is also.\nAnd here is the result. From Italy, COVID-19 has spread throughout Europe. The countries of the Schengen zone close the borders one after another, Russia, the USA and other countries prohibit the entry of residents of the European Union.\nFrom the promised land, where the whole world seeks to go, Europe is turning into a zone of global exclusion.\nIt is noteworthy that the United States was in the same unenviable position in the Western Hemisphere. The shining beacon of democracy for the rest of the New World faced a full-fledged epidemic and imposed a state of emergency. In turn, in South America the situation is not so critical.\nIn the Eastern Hemisphere, the numbers speak all the more for themselves. In Russia, which has four thousand kilometers of a common border with China, there are 47 cases of COVID-19 as of Saturday, March 14. The vast majority of distributors are people who come from Europe.\nIn that same Europe, the number of officially confirmed cases of a new type of coronavirus surpassed 20 thousand, and in some EU countries the number of cases increases by one and a half thousand per day.\nThe West was incomparably less successful in repelling the new challenges of our time than Russia and many other non-Western countries. This means that now the influence of the West in the world will decline even faster."}, {"url": "https://bawabaa.org/news/226877", "title": "Amir Khan: Corona Virus Linked to \"5G\" Network Test", "text": "Amir Khan: Corona Virus Linked to \"5G\" Network Test\nThe British boxer, Amir Khan, believes that the reality of the spread of Corona virus emerging from China is a false matter, and it is related to testing the 5G network.\nAmir Khan said through the application \"Instagram\": \"I do not think that the virus came from China.

While some political leaders call the ongoing developments a “war” against the invisible enemy, the real numbers and developments on the ground clearly demonstrate that the threat is drastically exaggerated and intentionally fueled by media and governments.\nThere are several phenomena caused by attempts of various forces and influence groups to exploit the coronavirus narrative:\n- Financial circles and governments are using the coronavirus crisis in order to achieve own financial and political goals, as well as to cover crissi developments in the global economy (the Saudi offensive on the oil market is another sign of the crisis);\n- The outbreak is exploited by the Washington establishment and its allies to increase pressure on the opponents of the US-dominated global order. China became the first target of the attack. Now, similar developments could be observed in Russia. Large Russian cities and even government bodies (like the foreign ministry) are being targeted by waves of fake news and artificial hysteria. Anti-government, Western-backed forces operating inside Russia will likely work to exploit the coronavirus narrative to destabilize the situation in the country;\n- The virus outbreak became a useful pretext for a further regionalization of the world that breaks into seprated economic political clusters. The myth about the ‘European unity’ as well as the ‘Euro-Atlantic’ one is destroyed. All states are fighting the crisis almost alone. Only so-called “bad guys” like China, Venezuela or Cuba are offering their help to other states;\n- Governments are strengthening surveillance and security measures limiting freedoms of citizens;\n- Global corporations are exploiting the crisis to shape their business processes and pushing forward the concept of distance working (from home). So, they would be able to reduce costs and say goodbye to their already limited social obligations;\n- Experts and analysts note that the increasing economic and social tensions are increasing chances of open military conflicts. One of the possible hot points is the Middle East, where the US-Iranian conflict is on the rise.\nThere are no doubts that the crisis will end. However, the world will not be same.\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n- World In Panic: Crude Oil Prices Drop Further, As Europe Locks Down Against Coronavirus Spread\n- Netanyahu Gives Himself Broad Phone Tapping Powers To Fight “Invisible Enemy” Coronavirus\nDonate"}, {"url": "https://www.turess.com/aljarida/220147", "title": "A Russian scientist reveals a surprise about the source of corona that hit China", "text": "Vyacheslav Eileen, head of the department of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, believes that the SK virus is not excluded from falling into a meteorite on Chinese soil. \"Chandra Wikrasingh, a famous external biologist from Cardiff University in Wales, announced several days ago that he does not rule out that the Corona virus has fallen to the ground with the meteor that exploded over China in October 2019,\" Eileen told Russian news agency RIA Novosti.

Countries close their borders one after another. In Russia, they restrict traffic at checkpoints on the border with China and Mongolia, passenger rail services are stopped, and air traffic is limited.\nCases of infection have already been recorded in 23 states. Now, on this list, Russia, however, is again sick of the citizens of China.\n“A patient with coronavirus infection is in a special ward. The patient was suspiciously identified on the day of crossing the border, ”said Svetlana Lapa, head of the Rospotrebnadzor for the Trans-Baikal Territory.\nThe number of infected around the world exceeded 14 thousand people, another 20 thousand - under suspicion. More than 90 percent is accounted for by China itself, more than 300 people became victims of the virus. Immediately in 31 provinces of China, an emergency regime was introduced.\nA vaccine for the virus is already being developed, including by our scientists. The Russian Ministry of Health has prepared recommendations to prevent the spread of infection.\nThe country's leadership is following the epidemic, a special headquarters has been formed, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. The protective measures that are being taken in the regions are reported directly to the Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\nThe President ordered the evacuation of citizens of our country from the most infected regions with the help of the Russian Aerospace Forces. The first aircraft of the Ministry of Defense are ready to fly to the epicenter country. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin decided to close ground checkpoints in the Far East, and the Russians immediately removed from China.\n“The checkpoint is closed, which is why a kilometer-long queue of heavy trucks has accumulated here. And now a bus is passing by us - there are tourists in it, who urgently had to be evacuated from China, ”Zvezda correspondent Denis Ivlev reports from the border.\nSophia Horova is studying in Harbin. She was among those hundred Russians who were urgently returned to their homeland by bus. She admits that this was unexpected for her.\n“They didn’t tell us anything until the last. On the contrary, it was assumed that we would stay until March until the border was opened, ”Sofia said.\nAt the border crossings, all passengers underwent careful control - checking with thermal imagers, examination by doctors. There were some difficulties - two people were unhealthy. They found a high fever, which is the first symptom of a coronavirus. Literally a few hours later, the test showed that tourists had a common SARS, but doctors were required to play it safe.\nToday, response measures are also being taken at regional levels. In the border region with the province of Heilongjiang Blagoveshchensk, a “mask” regime was introduced for schoolchildren.\nIn Vladivostok, they prepared special isolated rooms for potential infected people, they also do tests to identify coronavirus and carry out all the necessary procedures to monitor the condition of patients and prevent further spread of the disease.\nThe once-bustling Chinese market in Vladivostok is now empty. Even before the epidemic, all the merchants left for their homeland to celebrate the Eastern New Year, but the holidays will soon end, and if the border is opened, Chinese citizens will begin to return en masse to Russia, including from the infected areas of China.\nMikhail Schelkanov, doctor of biological sciences, professor at the FEFU School of Biomedicine and head of the virology laboratory of the Federal Research Center for Biodiversity of the Far Eastern Branch of the Academy of Sciences knows everything about viruses. He has worked with hundreds of diseases, including Ebola. I am sure that the return of Chinese citizens to Russia should not be harmful.\n“I see no reason to panic. If you look at the incidence rate, even if it is relative to the population of Hubei Province, you will see that this is a tiny percentage. The level of deaths from patients at the level of 2-3%. With all the cynicism, this is a very low percentage. And we must take into account that the spread rate is much lower than the same flu that we are familiar with, ”Mikhail Shchelkanov explains.\nThere are many theories about the origin of coronavirus and the further development of events. The most popular one concerns the monstrous prediction of Microsoft CEO Bill Gates. Last year, he said that 33 million people could die from such a coronavirus in 250 days. The calculations are purely mathematical, but true, the IT tycoon is sure.\nAfter such statements, adherents of conspiracy theories literally have no doubt that the virus is of artificial origin, and Bill Gates is one of its main sponsors. Another fact adds weight to this theory - a few months ago, the head of Microsoft held a conditional exercise called Event 201, which simulated an outbreak of a new virus that killed 65 million people in 18 months. The idea of the teachings is simple - globalization in the name of salvation.\n\"So, let's begin. The world was seized by a global pandemic. And only well-coordinated work of states and big business can stop it. ”\nIt is noteworthy that the famous pharmaceutical giants and the Pentagon leadership participated in this theater of cruel cynicism.\n“This cannot be a coincidence, when the exercises were conducted, the coronavirus did not exist. Either it should be Nostradamus, or the person who created it. Therefore, these exercises are no longer even indirectly, but directly confirm Gates’s involvement in this story, ”said Dmitry Zhuravlev, political scientist and director of the Institute for Regional Problems.\nThe fact is that while the disease affects only the representatives of the Mongoloid race, such suspicious selectivity raises questions from experts. No less widespread discussion was caused by the story around the laboratory for the study of dangerous viruses. It is located in Wuhan, 32 kilometers from the same market where the disease was first recorded.\nHowever, there is another biolaboratory in Wuhan - until recently, nothing was known about it. Her address is like someone’s joke - Gaoxin, three sixes - the number mentioned in the Bible, under which the name of the beast of the Apocalypse is hidden. But it’s even more symbolic that it exists on the money of the famous banker Jorozh Soros, who shares the globalist ideas of Bill Gates. It would seem that nuclear conspiracy theology is completely different, but experts say that a tricky plan lies behind an absurd wrapper.\n“She is not only Soros, but also Chinese. And that might work. 11 million people - times. Chinese responsibility is higher. If the virus escapes, then China will respond. And the United States and Soros will be out of business. A very good plan, ”adds Dmitry Zhuravlev.\nEconomists claim that the outbreak of a new virus could cause another economic crisis. Trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is accompanied by a decline in quotations. Assets related to tourism, trade, gambling and transport are falling. But at the same time there are those who benefit from the coronavirus.\n“Any pharmaceutical company that is involved in the development of epidemiology-related medicines — be it vaccines, antibiotics, immunomodulators — anything that can be attributed to the treatment of influenza — it benefits from this. It’s just like two or two, ”said the president of the Patients League, a member of the Russian government’s expert council, Alexander Saversky.\nSome \"marketing geniuses\" decided that the epidemic is a good reason to rebrand a simple SARS. Pharmacies are actively selling antiviral and immunomodulating drugs with the slogans \"Protect yourself from coronavirus.\" One thing is clear, those who benefit from the disease will continue to fuel mass hysteria. After all, a set of pills, sprays and potions can be sold well, and common sense is free.

Barnett; Originally appeared on lewrockwell.com\n“Our contemporaries are constantly excited by two conflicting passions; they want to be led, and they wish to remain free: as they cannot destroy either one or the other of these contrary propensities, they strive to satisfy them both at once. They devise a sole, tutelary, and all-powerful form of government, but elected by the people. They combine the principle of centralization and that of popular sovereignty; this gives them a respite: they console themselves for being in tutelage by the reflection that they have chosen their own guardians. Every man allows himself to be put in leading-strings, because he sees that it is not a person or a class of persons, but the people at large that holds the end of his chain.\nBy this system the people shake off their state of dependence just long enough to select their master, and then relapse into it again. A great many persons at the present day are quite contented with this sort of compromise between administrative despotism and the sovereignty of the people; and they think they have done enough for the protection of individual freedom when they have surrendered it to the power of the nation at large. This does not satisfy me: the nature of him I am to obey signifies less to me than the fact of extorted obedience.” ~ Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America\nAny real state of fear will bring panic, and once panic is the prevailing attitude of society at large, the herd seeks safety at all cost. Seeking safety under these circumstances allows for tyranny by the ruling class, and when the restrictive consequences of that tyranny are in place, escape from mass servitude is almost impossible to achieve. It must be understood that decisions made under stress due to fear end with a loss of freedom, and when freedom is compromised, what is left is slavery.\nWe have been told that a pandemic is upon us, and that we must sacrifice for the good of all, and for the sake of the nation. If the people at large accept this premise, individual sovereignty is not only compromised, but also permanently damaged. When the masses as a group seek shelter from harm, and agree to temporarily relinquish some or all of their freedoms, oppression is the result. That is why panic is so perilous, and why hasty decisions should never be made during a real or supposed crisis.\nAs I write this, it is obvious that none of these suggestions have been followed, and the herd has acquiesced to most all commands from on high in order to gain what will most likely turn out to be false hope at the expense of accepted domination. At this point, it is not too late to reverse part of the damage, but any continuation of mass subservience will only end in oppressive misery.\nThere is no certainty that this new coronavirus called COVID-19 is any more dangerous than any other virus in the past, but the ruling class and their minions in the mainstream media and beyond, are screaming at the top of their lungs that this is the scourge of mankind, and that tens of millions of Americans will become infected, and that millions might die. This is being promulgated by government at every level, by so-called national and world health organizations, and by a complicit media that seemingly does as it is told by those holding political power. This is being done regardless of the fact that no one knows much about this so-called virus, knows little or nothing about its true origin, and knows little about its mutations. Also, politicians, claimed authorities, and alleged experts are in the dark as to how particular cultures have been more susceptible than others, and are unwilling to discuss that the probable cause of this is due to a man-made strain created in a bio-weapons lab, even though a preponderance of evidence points in that direction. All possibilities should be discussed.\nCurrent headlines today:\nTrump To Declare National Emergency\nComplete shutdown On Table\nThis government is now taking total control over our lives, and will take full advantage of this situation to bring draconian anti-liberty measures to all that live in this country. This is an atrocity, and one that will change the face of this nation. Current risk includes the implementing of medical martial law as well as the possibility of total martial law with any major resistance from those not willing to accept being in a captured society. I outlined the measures that have been implemented by at least 40 states to affect medical martial law recently in this article. The act that has been adopted is the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (MSEHPA), and the included language is dictatorial in nature.\nBesides the sheer tyranny of these measures being planned and implemented as I write this, the certain economic devastation to come is unimaginable. No one will be spared economic harm, and many will be completely destroyed by the government’s response to this manufactured panic. In addition, when the virus scare is over, and it will be, the economic destruction will remain, and it could take years for any recovery to take place.\nHas all this panic been planned? The impending economic collapse caused by the Federal Reserve and its massive money printing is most likely going to be falsely blamed on the coronavirus, so what is the connection? Was this virus created for the purpose of covering up responsibility for an economic meltdown? Was it created to harm the economy of China and Iran? If not, is it being purposely used for these purposes? Is population control due to all these factors mentioned sought by the ruling class, and is this virus the impetus for gaining that control?\nWhat is next on the agenda due to this panic? Will there be total lockdowns? Will there be universal travel restrictions, even at the local level? Will there be forced vaccinations? Will there be mandatory testing and inspections? Will there be food shortages? Will this lead to concentration camps for dissenters? Will the National Guard and military be patrolling the streets of your town?\nThere are many unanswered questions, and much uncertainty about this virus, so what is the real danger? The real danger to America is the U.S. government and its dictatorial response to what appears to be an orchestrated hysteria. The solutions offered by Trump and this government, regardless of who is pulling the strings of these puppets, are far more dangerous than any manufactured pandemic. Fear and panic allow for control, and those in power understand this truth, and use it to their advantage. Panic is worthless, and can only lead to the acceptance of authoritative rule. This is the real risk; this is the real danger. If the people allow a takeover of their lives due to this panic, they will not only have lost their liberty and all they own, they will have also lost their sanity.\nDonate"}, {"url": "https://www.geopolitica.ru/en/article/coronavirus-and-horizons-multipolar-world-geopolitical-possibilities-epidemic", "title": "Coronavirus and the horizons of a multipolar world: the geopolitical possibilities of epidemic", "text": "Coronavirus and the horizons of a multipolar world: the geopolitical possibilities of epidemic\nThe global coronavirus pandemic has enormous geopolitical implications. The world will never be the same again. However, it is premature to speak of what kind of world it will end up being. The outbreak has not passed: we have not even reached the peak. The main unknown points remain:\n- what kind of losses will humanity ultimately suffer - how many deaths?\n- Who will be able to stop the virus from spreading, and how?\n- What are the real consequences for those who have been sick and those who have survived?\nNo one can yet answer these questions even approximately, and therefore we cannot even remotely imagine the real damage. In the worst case scenario, the pandemic will lead to a serious decline in the world's population. At best, the panic will turn out to be premature and groundless.\nBut even after the first months of the pandemic, some global geopolitical changes are already quite obvious and largely irreversible. No matter how the subsequent events unfold, something in the world order has changed once and for all.\nThe thaw of unipolarity\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic has been a decisive moment in the destruction of the unipolar world and the collapse of globalization. The crisis of unipolarity and the slippage of globalization has been noticeable since the very beginning of the 2000s - the 9/11 catastrophe, the sharp growth of China's economy, the return to global politics of Putin's Russia as an increasingly sovereign entity, the sharp activation of the Islamic factor, the growing crisis of migrants and the rise of populism in Europe and even the United States that resulted in the election of Trump and many other parallel phenomena have made it clear that the world formed in the 90s around the dominance of the West, the US and global capitalism has entered a crisis phase. The multipolar world order is beginning to form with new central actors, civilizations, as anticipated by Samuel Huntington. While there were signs of emerging multipolarity, a trend is one thing, and objective reality another. It is like cracked ice in spring - it is clear that it will not last long, but at the same time, it is undeniably here - you can even move across it, albeit with risk. No one can be certain when the cracked ice will actually give way.\nWe can now begin the countdown to a multipolar world order - the starting point is the coronavirus epidemic. The pandemic has buried globalization, open society and the global capitalist system. The virus has forced us onto the ice and individual enclaves of humanity have begun to take their isolated historical trajectories.\nThe coronavirus has buried all the major myths of globalization:\n- the effectiveness of open borders and the interdependence of the world's countries,\n- the ability of supranational institutions to cope with an extraordinary situation,\n- the sustainability of the global financial system and the world economy as a whole when faced with serious challenges,\n- the uselessness of centralized states, socialist regimes and disciplinary methods in solving acute problems and the complete superiority of liberal strategies over them,\n- the total triumph of liberalism as a panacea for all problem situations.\nTheir solutions have not worked in Italy, or other EU countries, nor in the United States. The only thing that has proven effective is the sharp closure of society, reliance on domestic resources, strong state power and isolation of the sick from the healthy, citizens from foreigners, etc.\nAt the same time, even the countries of the West reacted to the pandemic quite differently: the Italians introduced full quarantine, Macron introduced a regime of state dictatorship (in the spirit of Jacobins), Merkel gave €500 billion to support the population, and Boris Johnson, following the spirit of Anglo-Saxon individualism, suggested that the disease be considered a private matter for every Englishman and refused to carry out testing, sympathizing in advance with those who will lose loved ones. Trump established a state of emergency in the United States, closing communications with Europe and the rest of the world. If the West acts so disparately and contradictorily, then what about the rest of the countries? Everyone seems to be saving themselves as they can. This has been best accomplished by China, which, as a result of the Communist Party's hands-on policies, has established tough disciplinary methods to fight the infection and accused the United States of spreading it. The same accusation was made by Iran, which has been hit hard by the virus - including among the country's top leadership.\nThus the virus has ripped apart the open society at the seams and thrust mankind forward on its voyage toward a multipolar world.\nWhatever ended with the fight against the coronavirus, it is clear that globalization has collapsed. This could almost certainly spell the end of liberalism and its total ideological dominance. It is hardly possible to foresee the final version of the future world order - especially in its details. Multipolarity is a system that historically has not existed, and if we look for some distant analogue of it, we should turn not to the era of more or less equivalent European states after the Westphalian world, but to the time preceding the era of the Great Geographical Discovery, when, along with Europe (divided into Western and Eastern Christian countries), the Islamic world, India, China and Russia existed as independent civilizations. The same civilizations existed in the pre-colonial period in America (the Incas, Aztecs, etc.) and Africa. There were links and contacts between these civilizations, but there was no single binding type with universal values, institutions and systems.\nThe post-coronavirus world is likely to involve individual world regions, civilizations, continents gradually forming into independent players. At the same time, the universal model of liberal capitalism will likely collapse. This model currently serves as the common denominator of the whole structure of unipolarity: from the absolutization of the market to parliamentary democracy and human rights ideology, including notions of progress and the law of technological development which have become a dogma in New Age Europe and spread to all human societies through colonization (directly or indirectly in the form of westernization).\nMuch will depend on who will defeat the epidemic and how: where disciplinary measures prove effective, they will enter the political and economic order of the future as an essential component. The same conclusion can be reached by those who, on the other hand, will not be able to cope with the threat of a pandemic through openness and by avoiding harsh measures. Temporary alienation dictated by the direct threat of contagion from another country and another region, the severance of economic ties and the necessary alienation from a single financial system will force states in the epidemic to look for self-reliance, because the priority will be food security, a minimum autonomy and economic autarchy to meet the vital needs of the population on the other side of any economic dogma, which, before the coronavirus crisis, was considered the only possibility. Even where liberalism and capitalism are preserved, they will be placed in the national framework in the spirit of mercantilist theories insisting on maintaining a monopoly on foreign trade in the hands of the state. Those who are less connected to the liberal tradition may well move in the inventories of the most optimal organization of \"big space\" in other directions - taking into account civilizational and cultural peculiarities.\nOne cannot say in advance what the multipolar model as a whole will eventually become, but the very fact of breaking the generally binding dogma of liberal globalization will open up completely new opportunities and ways for each civilization.\nAfter the coronavirus: multipolar safety\nThe multipolar world will create an entirely new security architecture. It may not be more sustainable or adaptable to conflict resolution, but it will be different. In this new model, the West, the US and NATO, if NATO still exists, will be just one factor alongside others. The US itself will clearly not be able (and probably will not want to, if the Trump line finally prevails in Washington) to play the role of the sole global arbitrator, and therefore, the US will acquire a different status after quarantine and state of emergency. It can be compared to Israel's role in the Middle East. Israel is undoubtedly a powerful country, actively influencing the balance of power in the region, but it does not export its ideology and values to the surrounding Arab countries. On the contrary, it preserves its Jewish identity for itself, trying rather to free itself from the holders of other values than to include them in its composition. Building a wall with Mexico and Trump's call for Americans to focus on their own internal problems is similar to Israel’s path: the United States will be a powerful power, but its liberal-capitalist ideology will only remain for itself, rather than by attracting outsiders. The same will apply to Europe. Consequently, the most important factor of the unipolar world will radically change its status.\nThis, of course, will lead to a redistribution of forces and functions among other civilizations. Europe, if it keeps its unity to any degree, is likely to create its own military bloc independent of the United States, which was already discussed after the collapse of the Soviet Union (the Eurocorps project) and has been repeatedly hinted at by Macron and Merkel. Not being directly hostile to the United States, such a bloc will in many cases follow European interests proper, which may sometimes differ sharply from those of the United States. First and foremost, it will affect relations with Russia, Iran, China and the Islamic world.\nChina will have to transform itself from a beneficiary of globalization and adapt to pursue its national interests as a regional power. This is exactly what all the processes in China have been heading towards lately - strengthening Xi Jianping's power, the \"One belt – One road\" project, etc. It will no longer be about globalization with Chinese characteristics, but an explicit Far Eastern project with special Confucian and partly socialist characteristics. Conflicts in the Pacific Ocean with the United States will clearly at some point become more acute.\nThe Islamic world will face a difficult problem of the new paradigm of self-organization, as in the conditions of formation of large spaces - Europe, China, USA, Russia, etc., individual Islamic countries will not be able to be fully commensurate with the rest and effectively defend their interests. There will be a need for several poles of Islamic integration – Shia (with the center in Iran) and Sunni, where, along with Indonesia and Pakistan in the East, a Western Sunni block around Turkey and some Arab countries of Egypt or the Gulf states is likely to be constructed.\nAnd finally, in the multipolar world order, Russia has a historical chance to strengthen itself as an independent civilization which will see an increase in power as a result of the sharp decline of the West and its internal geopolitical fragmentation. Yet, at the same time, it will also be a challenge: before fully asserting itself as one of the most influential and powerful poles in the multipolar world, Russia will have to pass the maturity test, preserving its unity and reasserting its zones of influence in the Eurasian space. It is not yet clear where the southern and western borders of Russia-Eurasia will be post-coronavirus. This will largely depend on what regime, what methods and efforts Russia will use to cope with the pandemic and what political consequences this has. In addition, it is impossible to knowingly predict the state of other \"large spaces\" - the poles of the multipolar world. The constitution of the Russian perimeter will depend on many factors, some of which may prove to be quite acute and conflictual.\nGradually, a system of multipolar settlement will be formed - either on the basis of the UN reformed under the conditions of multipolarity, or in the form of some new organization. Again, everything here will depend on how the fight against the coronavirus unfolds.\nThe virus as a mission\nOne should not be deceived: the world coronavirus pandemic is a turning point in world history. Not only are stock indices and oil prices collapsing, the world order itself is falling. We are living in the period of the end of liberalism and its \"obviousness\" as global meta-narrative, the end of its measures and standards. Human societies will soon become free floating: no more dogmas, no more dollar-imperialism, no more free market spells, no more Fed dictatorship or global stock exchanges, no more subservience to the world media elite. Each pole will build its future on its own civilizational foundations. It is obviously impossible to say what this will look like or what it will lead to. However, it is already clear that the old world order is becoming a thing of the past, and quite distinct contours of a new reality are emerging before us.\nWhat neither ideologies, nor wars, nor fierce economic battles, nor terror, nor religious movements have been able to do, has been accomplished by an invisible, yet deadly virus.
