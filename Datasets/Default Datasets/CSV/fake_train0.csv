Former Donald Trump adviser indicated that an American billionaire, Bill Gates, may have done this so that he could grow microchips in people's heads to distinguish between those who tested COVID-19 and were not tested.
Stone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: ""Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate""
He added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to sow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations
According to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is related to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain ""mandatory vaccinations""
Stone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the prospect of mandatory vaccinations
Gates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis such as coronaviruses, to the point of widespread talk about Gates’s prediction of the disease 3 years ago.
As the Washington Times reported, Gates announced earlier this month that his charitable organization would invest billions of dollars in factories that will focus on developing many vaccines.

Russia Today |
Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Hussein Salami said Thursday that the Corona virus may have been caused by a US biological attack that targeted China first and then Iran.
The commander of the Revolutionary Guards confirmed that Iran would win against the Corona virus, pointing out that his country was ""fighting a biological war and everyone should know that it will pass this stage towards stability.""
Salami added that if the Corona virus was an American biological attack, it would affect America itself. He said: ""Corona may be caused by an American biological attack that targeted China first, then Iran, then the rest of the world.""
The World Health Organization announced yesterday, Wednesday, that the new Corona virus has become entrenched in Iran, adding that the lack of preventive equipment for health care workers is complicating efforts to contain the spread of the virus.
The website of the Iranian presidency had quoted, on Wednesday, the Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani, as saying that the Coruna virus had infected almost all regions of Iran."

In a report published by the American ""Forbes"" magazine, it confirmed that there are some incorrect concepts regarding the virus, that it is not considered the most prevalent among other pathogens, for example, measles is more prevalent than it.
The death rate from this virus is 2%, which is a very small percentage for the rest of the epidemics such as Ebola, whose death rate reached 50%, as well as the natural flu that kills tens of thousands of people annually in America.
Corona is not considered a serious matter for the whole world, as it threatens China because it is specifically manufactured to reproduce within the physical environment that carries the chromosomes of the yellow race or the East Asian race, so to speak.
It is worth noting that the means of alternative medicine do not cure the corona, and the most important thing is to prevent this virus in the best way that is to wash your hands well and frequently, in addition to not friction with any sick person, because there is no treatment or vaccine at the present time.

Under the above title, Eurasia Expert published the text of a meeting with a Chinese expert on the future of the European Union after its reluctance to provide assistance to its members in facing the epidemic, and what Beijing and Moscow have done.
In this regard, Professor EurasiaExpert, Professor of Political Science and International Relations at Bucknell University in the United States of America, Prof. Che Jong-Tgu interviewed:
How will the Corona virus affect the economy of China and the United States? Can you give any numbers?
It is now difficult to anticipate the exact impact of the virus on the economy of China and the United States in numbers. We do not know how long this public health crisis will last, but there is no doubt that the two economies will be severely affected.
Given the interconnected nature of the modern global economy and the fact that all major economies are suffering from this epidemic, the prospects for a speedy recovery are very mysterious. It will take at least several years to stabilize the global economy.
Initially, the European Union did not help its partners fight the Corona virus, and China and Russia came to help. How will this affect the future of the European Union and international politics?
Indeed, the unity of the European Union has been put into question, as requests for assistance from its members have not been heard, and officials have admitted and apologized to Italy for the delay. This opened the door for China and Russia, which allowed them to play the role that other European Union members should have played.
Of course, Britain's exit from the European Union dealt a heavy blow to the Union. Consequently, as an international institution, it may undergo some important changes in the near future. Meanwhile, China's influence in Europe, especially in eastern and southern Europe, will continue to grow. As a result, the power structure in Europe will change radically, as will the relationship between the European Union and China.

Who knew?,"Suspicious facts accompanied Corona ... Who knew?
The official American prediction of a pandemic before it occurred raised a range of questions and speculation about the extent of the threat to the biological weapons program and its threat to the lives and welfare of large numbers of people.
The rapid spread and diversification of infectious epidemics globally since the beginning of the third millennium imposes a number of questions about the truth of their scientific roots, in the first place, and the political and strategic dimensions of all mankind from the directions of countries producing arsenals of biological weapons, led by the United States.
On these days in January 2012, an international conference convened by the United Nations in Geneva to develop mechanisms for monitoring biological weapons failed, in which the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, made a speech encouraging efforts to protect humanity from the specter of biological weapons; but she strongly rejected International restrictions to ensure the safety of the world.
John Bolton preceded him in his official position as Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, 2001, by rejecting the investigation system that the United Nations reached after exhausting years of negotiations, in whole and in detail, saying that ""the United States will simply not enter into agreements that would allow For rogue states or others to develop and deploy biological weapons. ""
Three countries are internationally ""trusted"" to implement the Biological Weapons Convention concluded in 1975 with the signing of 165 countries: Russia, Britain and the United States to receive complaints and suggest solutions.
Among the scientific complaints received by the ""Big Three,"" December 9, 2001, was a briefing by the American human rights organization Ithaca to the Seventh International Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention. It contained the United States' violation of the treaty due to its involvement in an activity related to the development of an offensive biological weapons program They are stored in Sierra Army Depots, in northern California and possibly in other regions. ""
It is noteworthy that the then US administration introduced ""Article 817"" to the articles of the Patriot Act, 2001, and it allows the government to develop and store biological weapons and their release systems without restrictions, that is, practically canceling the texts of the international agreement signed on it.
What is striking and disturbing is what was ""foretold"" by the then Deputy Minister of Homeland Security, Daniel Gerstein, addressing the aforementioned international conference, 2012, that his country ""expects a pandemic by the end of 2013"". The diagnosis was shared by Dr. Joseph Kim at the Enuvio Vaccine Production Company.
The official American prediction of a pandemic before it occurred raised a range of questions and speculation about the dangerous extent of the biological weapons program and its threat to the lives and welfare of large numbers of people.
The Hollywood community accompanied it with the production of a movie called Contagion in 2011, which revolves around a pandemic caused by bats, according to the prepared scenario, which is currently taking place with the Corona epidemic in China, which is likely to be the source of the virus in Wuhan Province.
In the context of the American ""prediction"", China was exposed in 2013 to a massive wave of ""bird flu - H7N9"", as it immediately began to exterminate millions of chicken birds, and this not only left negative repercussions on its economy, but at the global level to ban trade and dealing with Beijing. We are seeing it happening again these days.
On January 31, the US government announced its implementation of ""new measures to counter the Corona virus, including preventing Chinese citizens from entering its territory""; and applying quarantine to individuals coming from there.
“In 1971, Cuba was the first country in the Caribbean to announce its exposure to a dengue (dengue) epidemic, and it is believed to originate in Spain.” This was the summary of a medical bulletin issued by prestigious US health institutes in 2009. Cuba, in turn, accused the US government of spreading the epidemic Its animal wealth from pigs and it was forced to exterminate half a million heads.
Scientifically, the Corona virus infects the human respiratory system, which is similar to the previous SARS epidemic - acute pneumonia - and the origins of the two strains are from animals and have been transmitted to humans, and then to its human brother; , Due to its appearance and spread in Saudi Arabia in 2012, causing severe pneumonia to the patient.
Some experts in the field of biological sciences suggest that the US government will engage in ""designing a biological attack against China for geopolitical considerations"", coinciding with the spread of ""the new epidemic and danger"" with the Chinese New Year celebrations to paralyze Chinese society, a large majority of whom will use transportation to return to their original villages.
Professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, Richard Iberat, expressed to the Washington Post his doubts about the American source because ""the genome of the virus and its properties do not indicate that it is the kind produced in vitro"".
The newspaper and US circles have been charged with developing China for developing biological weapons in the Wuhan facility for a year, for ""engaging in espionage activities to obtain biological components.""
It was recorded earlier this week that a federal court directed an indictment against Harvard professor Charles Lieber and ""two people of Chinese nationality for their attempts to smuggle 21 tubes inside of biological material into China"", and Lieber receives a monthly reward of $ 50,000 from Wuhan Technical University, according to the indictment .
What strengthens the hypotheses of the American source of the virus is the Trump administration’s policy of fighting China by all means, starting with trade wars, and also exposing it to a series of “deadly bacterial attacks and viral diseases, and symptoms targeting both livestock and humans.”
The Epidemiologist at the Rand Institute, Jennifer Bowie, confirmed the close link between the two epidemics (SARS and Corona) as ""the compatibility ratio between them is at least 70% of genetic material and transmission mechanisms. The mortality rate for those with SARS is about 10%, compared to 3"" % For Corona virus "".
Boi praised the transparency of scientists and the Chinese government, and the ""sharing of the international scientific edifice with the genome data of the virus,"" and reached them to know the causes within a short period of time, not exceeding a few days, which will contribute to developing an effective vaccine soon.
The American epidemiologist, Dina Grayson, expressed concern about a set of facts surrounding the Corona virus, especially from the high speed of its spread from one person to another ""It is not only contagious, but kills the infected."" Grayson has long experience in developing drugs to treat the Ebola epidemic.
It is worth noting that Corona virus is a US product with distinction, according to the registry of invention submitted in 2015, which was approved in 2018.
In the same context, there are ""separate"" strange incidents that targeted China originating in North America; the most prominent of which was the shipment arrival of a source from Canadian biological laboratories, in March 2019, which included ""malicious viruses,"" which the Canadians claimed was ""part of the research efforts to support public health research."" In the world."" It is worth noting that this shipment was carried out under the veil of secrecy, in contrast to the usual procedures, which prompted the Chinese side to file a formal complaint in this regard.
A large US military delegation, consisting of 300 people, arrives in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China on October 19, 2019, to participate in a military games festival hosted by China and held there. On November 2, 2019, the first infection with the Corona virus was recorded in that province, and it later spread rapidly in December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days.
The cost of what China has been exposed to as a result of the epidemic is prohibitive by all measures: disruption of flights and the movement of trains and other transportation at the height of its largest and most important annual holidays; and the stricken Wuhan municipality imposed a ban on leaving the town on the population “only for emergency reasons; Everyday life and tremendous business exchanges with the world.
Ultimately, who can answer the question about who benefits from all this can reach the heart of the matter: waging wars with biological weapons at a lower cost than nuclear engagement."

China is racing against time to contain 'Corona' and the virus is spreading in several countries DW | 25.01.2020 In a race against time, the Chinese authorities are resolutely seeking comprehensive and strict measures to contain the spread of the Coruna virus, while many countries are witnessing the spread of the virus in a global alert to face a real and imminent danger. Congratulations on this deficiency. 2020 is impressive, exciting. It is amazing from its beginning so far. Unfortunately, it is too late.
Why does Russia never accuse Israel but rather resort to accusing the United States, because the planet of torment will destroy central America and it will not become a superpower, but Israel will be the superpower, so the enemy of the Arabs, Muslims and Christians will be the Russians and Israel is the revolution of anger _25 Muhammad_ Ali Corona and your body with you _ politician This is a form of Russian backwardness LOL

In retaliation for China, this is correct ... The Russians, like the Iranians, are complaining about something they melt at the United States
Will China succeed in curbing an outbreak of the Coronavirus? Criticism of the Chinese authorities accuses it of slowing efforts to contain and combat the outbreak of the Coronavirus.

The new Corona virus causes symptoms similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which killed 650 people in China and Hong Kong between 2002 and 2003.
Common symptoms of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
Is the virus a biological weapon?
A former member of the United Nations Commission on Biological Weapons, Igor Nikulin, believes that the emergence of this virus could be the result of the use of an American biological weapon. He mentioned the scandal in 2010, when one of the 400 American military biological laboratories deployed around the world was closed in Indonesia because it was conducting secret experiments with the bird flu virus. When the virus emerged from the laboratory and a serious pandemic began, the United States refused to provide information about its work to the Indonesian Ministry of Health.
Health officials around the world are racing to control the virus, which first appeared last month, similar to the SARS virus, and the World Health Organization is expected to announce later today whether the spread of the new disease warrants a declaration of an emergency, which relates to complex cross-border epidemics.
The vaccine against the virus
In less than a week, virologists from the Novosibirsk State Scientific Center ""Viktor"" developed a diagnostic test system for Corona virus, which would allow detection of the virus at an early stage of the disease.
But it is too early to talk about the development of a vaccine. State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin has asked the State Duma Health Protection Committee to prepare anti-virus measures in the country.
Among the measures taken, all travelers arriving from Southeast Asia are examined by thermal imaging at the airports. Hospitals in the Amur region are on high alert. Likewise, preventive measures are being taken across the country - especially in large transport centers. In particular, quarantine control at checkpoints at state borders has been strengthened, and the epidemiological situation is monitored daily.
The Russian Consumer Protection Agency, ""Ross Potter Nadzor"" said that the specialists of the ""Victor"" Center within the organization have devised tools for the laboratory diagnosis of the new disease.
Scientists from Novosibirsk developed two independent diagnostic groups, dependent on the method used in molecular biology and the chain polymerase reaction. Using one of these methods, the 2019-nCoV virus can be detected at an early stage, and the second is used to diagnose another serious disease that humanity has encountered before is SARS. The polymerase chain reaction method is very sensitive: it can even detect individual copies of viruses in only 2-4 hours. For this, a small swab of the nasopharynx is sufficient. Thus, rapid diagnosis can be made immediately in the laboratories of the Russian Epidemiology Centers of the Russian Consumer Protection Agency located throughout the country.
It is reported that ""Victor"" one of the largest scientific centers in virology and biotechnology in Russia and the world. Here, one of the first test systems was developed to diagnose HIV and hepatitis B, immunostimulating drug ""Ridustine"" and many other unique medicines.
""It is impossible to develop a vaccine within a week, and the evaluation of efficacy also needs time. This is the seventh version of the Corona virus known to humanity since 1965,"" Gennady Onishchenko told the Tsargrad website. Our country is using a vaccine against it yet, and we must understand that different viral diseases require total or regional vaccination only in the event of a disease. In this case, there is no such need. ”
He added that Wuhan is not far from us, the city is closer than it seems to many. Here we talk about an acute respiratory infection that is easy to transmit. He got on the plane, and after a few hours the virus was here. """

Vyacheslav Eileen, head of the department of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, believes that the SK virus is not excluded from falling into a meteorite on Chinese soil.
""Chandra Wikrasingh, the famous external biologist from Cardiff University in Wales, announced several days ago that he does not rule out that the Corona virus has fallen to the ground with the meteor that exploded over China in October 2019,"" Eileen told Russian news agency RIA Novosti.
""Is it possible? Yes, it is possible,"" the Russian expert said, responding to a question from the agency's correspondent. He added, explaining, to answer the question accurately, a study should be made of DNA synthesis of similar viruses during a long journey in space. Such an experiment is planned for 2023-2024 when the Bion-M No. 2 is launched.
This experiment involves the launching of a rocky ""meteorite"", on which the outer surface contains holes in which bacteria have high temperature resistant bacteria and some chemicals that can form the basis of the organic matter composition. The main goal of this experiment is to verify whether life on Earth has been brought from space.
""This is a very exciting experiment from the point of view of the ability to transfer biological materials, including nucleotide chains, which can be the basis for synthesis of anything similar to viruses,"" he says.

https://hournews.net/news.php?id=100922,A famous Russian doctor explains the secret of immunity against corona,"Hourly News Date: 04-04-2020 | Since: 4 weeks ago
Elena Malysheva, the famous Russian presenter and presenter, enumerated some nutrients that can boost the body's immunity to fight the infection of the Coruna virus.
During one of her televised medical programs, Malysheva said: ""Food products that contain large amounts of zinc are necessary to activate the so-called killer cells in the body. These cells, according to doctor Andre Prodius, are tasked with killing other cells infected with the virus.""
The doctor indicated that a person can get this important component from different foods such as shellfish, oats and corn flakes.
According to Malysheva, the elderly with diabetes are among the most at risk of corona, due to the symptoms that may cause zinc deficiency in their bodies, which may affect the work of their immune system.
The doctor advised those suffering from cardiovascular diseases and cancer patients to add the Brazilian nuts to their diet as it contains selenium, which is considered an anti-oxidant and an important component to strengthen the immune system.
She also stressed the need to drink more water, especially for the elderly, and she explained that dehydration and lack of fluids helps increase the concentration of viruses and germs in the body.

Not only the newcomers like Poland, the Czech Republic or Latvia, who at that time were so vigorously seeking EU membership - also the Union veteran Denmark no longer allows foreigners to enter - regardless of whether they are Europeans or not. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis succinctly: ""We cannot wait until Brussels gives us advice.""
All hymns of praise for the “common European values” that this “elite group of countries” should supposedly weld together are forgotten. The combination of words ""European solidarity"" suddenly sounds more or less realistic with the addition of ""so-called"".
""Be embraced, millions!"" - in the era of the handshake ban, the hymn sounds like a tasteless mockery. Actually, the choir from Beethoven's Ninth is just as forbidden - regardless of the 250th anniversary of the world classic. It would be logical, after all, all concert halls have already been locked as a precaution.
Is the EU just an abbreviation for selfish union?
Italy. The cheerful member of the European family was promptly expelled as soon as it showed serious health problems. Wasn't it at least worth considering how the tangible child could be helped tangibly and substantially? If that had happened, the Italians would not have begged for masks and disposable gloves outside the EU.
Spahn countered that the distribution had not worked so far: the protective clothing only came where the highest prices were paid. Exports from Germany are not prohibited, but must be approved individually. The German health minister also asked the EU Commission to put an export ban on third countries into effect: ""We can cut down national measures if there is a European Union measure."" Whether European or ""non-European"" - the cash register must be right first .
The balance sheets for the ECB appear to come first, then Corona
Speaking of cash registers: The ECB refuses to serve as a reliable support for the EU in the troubled Corona times. ECB chief Christine Lagarde made this clear after the bank's council meeting last Thursday. ""Der Spiegel"": ""It had been said in advance that her appearance today could be Lagarde's 'whatever it takes' moment, as her predecessor Mario Draghi had. In summer 2012, just a few months after taking up duty, the Italian announced that he would buy unlimited government bonds on the market if necessary, in order to keep the euro zone together. "" .
The entire EU construct with its costly bureaucratic institutions and ""common values"" has not passed the coronavirus test - at least there is more and more confirmation of this claim. With the ban on Europeans announced by US President Donald Trump, the famous transatlantic solidarity has also shaken tremendously. All the EU skeptics and other globalization critics are almost invasively brought on the scene. One must slowly wonder why these seem so hesitant at first. One possible explanation: You are all washing your hands (innocently) and do not want to be distracted.

https://orbitt.net/category/us-media/,Orbitt.net,"As we approach the middle of March 2020 with Super Tuesday behind us, the moderate candidacy of Joe Biden has gained momentum, notching ten victories. The recent spat of moderate candidates dropping out (Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Bloomberg, Steyer) alongside Elizabeth Warren’s decision to stay in for Super Tuesday (and dropping out right after) boosted Biden into the lead in delegate count, but it is unclear going forward whether he will be able to gain ground or maintain his advantage.
His campaign is essentially a redux of Hillary Clinton’s in 2016, a dystopian offering of neoliberal establishment ideas: essentially the most harmful, bland, out-of-touch, uninspiring, and ignorant set of centrist policies. Biden offers nothing new, substantial, or exciting; and he himself stated to donors last year that “nothing would fundamentally change” under his presidency. By continuing to go with “moderate”, centrist agendas, the Democratic Party establishment, corporate America, and mainstream media reveal they would rather lose to Trump than get behind the progressive choice, Bernie Sanders.
Support for Bernie Sanders is strong across all national polling, yet in past debates, his moderate rivals continued to shoot themselves in the foot by offering up the most ridiculous arguments against progressive causes. Regardless of his success, Biden has learned nothing and absorbed no lessons from his fellow moderates’ failures or the excitement and promise offered by the progressive wing of his party. He is a living fossil. Like his corporate-backed counterpart moderates, his whole shtick is based on presenting himself as the lesser of two evils, offering the most milquetoast set of policies, and attempting to make voters fearful of Sanders’ incremental reforms by casting them as socialist and authoritarian.
By representing Sanders’ social democratic policies as “dangerous” as well as his supporters as being rude on social media because they actually care and are passionate about changing the direction of this country, the centrist hydra of campaign rhetoric and establishment media devolved into offering an infantile, McCarthyite debating style.
Much like the centrist triad of Biden, Buttigieg (who suspended his campaign March 1st), and Klobuchar (also suspended March 2nd), who are equal parts sell-outs, windbags, and sycophantic brown-nosers to the ruling class, the professional class choice, technocrat, pseudo-progressive Elizabeth Warren as well as what I’d call the “Silicon Valley candidate” Andrew Yang also represent the epitome of “big-brained centrist” thought.
Basically, this term represents the attitude of mainstream liberal as well as conservative candidates, commentators, and their supporters who believe they truly understand the world better than anyone else due to what they consider their meritocratic success, and use all sorts of neoliberal fallacies, deliver paeans to pragmatism and bipartisanship, mock social democratic reforms with calls to be “reasonable”, and generally act as puppets of corporate and imperial power. Of course, it should be obvious that those who harp on achieving “realistic goals” are those that view anything involving a transformation of society involving redistribution of wealth from the rich to the working classes asprima facieunrealistic.
As for Steyer and Bloomberg, they too fall prey to neoliberal notions of rugged individualism; i.e., that their economic success is due to their own “hard work”, and were so completely out of touch that they cannot realize the electorate is not prepared to substitute one billionaire for another, no matter what party they represent, or what good they claim they’ve been able to accomplish in their philanthropic endeavors.
All of the candidates, except for Bernie Sanders, completely debased themselves when asked if the candidate with the most delegates should get the Democratic nomination. That’s how democracy is supposed to work, right? The person with the most votes should win, no? Not if you want to suck up to the ruling class, who are deathly afraid of Sanders’ redistributive agenda.
Climbing corporate and political hierarchies as well as the fake meritocracy in this country inflates politicians’ egos and warped the ability to self-reflect on their own abilities and intelligence. In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger Effect, defined as: “a cognitive bias in which people wrongly overestimate their knowledge or ability in a specific area. This tends to occur because a lack of self-awareness prevents them from accurately assessing their skills.”
Terrifyingly, one of the consequences of this effect is that many of the afflicted exude rare confidence due to their overestimation of their skills that can be mistaken for dedication, passion, expertise, and conviction. While truly intelligent people constantly question and doubt their own ideas and preconceived notions, lesser intellects rigidly cling to dogmas in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. This was summed up best by Yeats, when he wrote: “The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.”
In politics and social relations, this effect is compounded because the awareness of the suffering of others is blunted the higher you go on the socio-economic scale. The effect of ascending political hierarchies is not much different in a capitalist economy, because the higher you go the more beholden you are to elite interests. As studies have shown, Emotional Intelligence (EQ) declines significantly the higher you look on the corporate ladder. CEOs and business owners tend to have more sociopathic, narcissistic, and psychopathic traits.
This is why it is so hard to change the minds of the privileged and affluent: it is not simply a matter of intellect and rational argumentation to help bring change to another’s belief system. If only logical persuasion worked that effectively! One must also help cultivate awareness, a sense of interconnectedness with the less fortunate, the environment and the universe, and a way to empathize with poor, vulnerable, and minority communities. One can prove empirically over and over how a socialist economy, universal healthcare, and a society of free association of producers would significantly improve the lives of people around the world. Those in denial still won’t believe you, because their self-awareness and sense of empathy for the poor, dispossessed, and vulnerable has atrophied.
It is at this stage in history that the nihilism of rich liberals and conservatives as well as the professional-managerial class reaches truly epic proportions, threatening the survival of humanity and most species on the planet. The real material conditions and problems of working people are abstracted as inequality rises. The obvious cause of the immiseration of the population and the devastation of the environment, capitalism, is obscured. Conservatives and republicans are even more delusional due to their slavish devotion to the status quo and political and economic hierarchies, as well as their mythical belief that the capitalist “free market” can solve all manner of problems. Further, conservatives view any government intervention to regulate corporate monopoly power and lessen environmental degradation as an infringement on their rights, or inane arguments that sensible environmental regulation will hurt the economy are used.
The only option left for moderate liberals is to succumb to the dystopian vision of neoliberal thought which dominates center-left and center-right thinking, because it is all-pervasive. Even mild progressives who stray even a bit to the left (such as Warren) are instantly and predictably vilified by the press, by billionaires who literally cry in public in protestation of her wealth tax. This leads the opportunistic and ambitious (Warren, just like Obama before her) to tack to the center in order to secure donors to stay in politics and keep their jobs.
The moderate candidates know their ideas are viewed as trash by a significant amount of voters, so identity politics, as well as rhetoric and euphemisms about “structural change” are predictably trotted out. Neoliberal is now a dirty word, so liberal politicians deflect as much as possible and claim their policies are “pragmatic” and are willing to work across the aisle and compromise, in contrast to the “uncompromising” style of Sanders. These are the big-brained centrists, who let their ruling class donors do all their thinking for them as to what constitutes an acceptable and “realistic” policy.
Big-brain centrism is also a term to describe a type of neoliberal wonkery which emphasizes that only technocratic policy, which echoes the Third Way of Blair and Clinton, a centrism in which the patina of “progressivism”, economic “pragmatism”, and the appearance of caring for marginalized groups dominates. Increased political representation of minorities is a wonderful thing, but the moderate democrats will never grow a spine and ask for economic redistribution from billionaires to poor people of color. Only “moderates” can deliver the best model for liberal democracy, and everyone to their left, even the mild-mannered reformism of Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is an “extremist” or a “populist”. Of course, this hodge-podge of power-hungry politicians, clueless think-tank sycophants, and conniving corporate vampires are totally beholden to elite interests, as they represent a class of smug affluent liberals and republicans who pray to the Almighty Dollar.
The big-brained liberals are hypnotized by the concept of bipartisanship, which is what Obama tried and failed to do for eight years. For the centrists, the idea that the two-party system is become more polarized is an unmitigated disaster, leaving only “far-left” politics in fashion (we wish!) alongside far-right politics (accurate). True progress can only be made “in the middle”, what some like to call “radical centrism” and politicians should not pander to their constituents with “empty promises” and “populist rhetoric.” What this radical centrism misses is the rightward shift in economics and federal policy which has been underway for 40+ years, and the consequent shift in the Overton Window: the range of ideas that are considered acceptable in US politics. In the 1960s, for instance, Sanders’ reformism would have been seen as standard, middle-of-the-road liberal set of policies, rather than today, where social democratic agendas induce shrieking from rich know-nothings and talking heads who insist that Bernie is an authoritarian communist.
In this Beltway bubble-world, Sanders is simply the converse of Trump, a dangerous left-wing populist, who, in words of Buttigieg, “wants to burn this party down.” What Sanders simply wants is to bring the US into the 21st century by adopting the social democratic policies of Scandinavia and most European nations. Yet, this is unacceptable to the “realistic” and “electability” thought-police. Big brain centrism is what it would look like to put Thomas Friedman and David Brooks in a room together and let them try to come up with federal policies. Their policies and worldview probably would not look very different from some of the ideas and concepts of each of the recent candidates, presented below.
The main thing to recognize is that all the moderate candidates, Warren included, are careerists. It’s not about helping others, it’s about them. If and when politics no longer is a viable career path for them, they will be happy to sell themselves as consultants, lobbyists, mainstream media propagandists, sit on corporate boards, and rack up speaking fees to parrot back to the ruling classes what acceptable discourse and policy is, within a capitalist and imperialist framework.
To see more examples of what I mean by Big-Brained Centrism, we will look at a statement, tweet, or policy idea from many of the moderate candidates, even the ones who have dropped out. We’ll start with a statement from Andrew Yang, because it might be one of the best examples of big-brained idiocy.
Yangonomics: “Beware the Technocracy”, The Accelerationist Candidate
Andrew Yang’s entire campaign and many of his tech/start-up supporters represent exquisite examples of the big-brain mindset. In his final debate, he stated:
The entire capitalism/socialism dichotomy is completely out of date. The fact is when people were talking about these economic models they did not foresee the technology getting stronger, more powerful, and capable of doing the work of thousands of humans…what we have to do is get the markets working to improve our way of life…instead of following GDP and corporate profits off a cliff, we should be measuring our own health and wellness…the way forward is a new human-centered version of capitalism that actually uses the markets to improve our families lives.
This is absolute garbage, cloaked within the progressive notion of redefining national well-being and taking easy shots at corporate greed. Capitalism is utterly and inexorably based on over-consumption and chasing profits over everything else; there is no way to make it “human-centered”
If we were to take him at his word of meeting in the middle, a fair response would be that the closest version of a compromise solution for the “outdated dichotomy” is the social democratic and redistributive agenda of Bernie Sanders. More importantly, Yang is attempting to erase two hundred years of public debate as to the distinctions between two radically different economic models and the invaluable contributions of generations of activists, scholars, and citizens. Perhaps he believes that by virtue of being a “successful entrepreneur” and business owner, he can see things the rest of us can’t.
As for the “no one could have foreseen technology getting stronger…” give me a fucking break. You have to be drop-dead naïve or just plain ignorant to think this. You don’t think people who built the first trains, light bulbs, cars, worked in the first mills and factories, etc., couldn’t see how these inventions and new methods of production would reshape the world? Indigenous peoples, radical artists, environmentalists, communists, and anarchists have been warning about the negative impacts of industrial-scale technology for generations. In Western literature, towering figures like William Blake and Henry David Thoreau as well as many others prophetically warned of the dangers posed by the Industrial Revolution.
What happened, of course, is that the monopoly power of capital never allowed for the more efficient distribution of resources to make lives better for the working classes, because there is little money to be made by helping and caring for people and the environment. Capitalism relies on parasitical master-servant relationships, exploiting nature and the working classes for as many resources and as much labor as possible in order to produce the most profit in the shortest amount of time.
Contrary to Yang’s ahistorical word salad and his implicit assumption that people in the past were stupid, those who lived hundreds of years ago were just as intelligent as today (if not more so) and realized exactly where this was leading. In a very good piece forThe Guardian,Yanis Varoufakis explains how Marx and Engels predicted our crisis over 150 years ago:
Anyone reading the [Communist] manifesto today will be surprised to discover a picture of a world much like our own, teetering fearfully on the edge of technological innovation. In the manifesto’s time, it was the steam engine that posed the greatest challenge to the rhythms and routines of feudal life. The peasantry was swept into the cogs and wheels of this machinery and a new class of masters, the factory owners and the merchants usurped the landed gentry’s control over society. Now, it is artificial intelligence and automation that loom as disruptive threats, promising to sweep away ‘all fixed, fast-frozen relations’. ‘Constantly revolutionising … instruments of production,’ the manifesto proclaims, transform ‘the whole relations of society’, bringing about ‘constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation’.
Like the rest of the moderate candidates, Yang is a product of his insular milieu, his ideology molded by anti-communist/Cold War/red scare propaganda and the fevered dreams of Tech-mogul capitalists. Being an entrepreneur apparently means one does not have to read or understand political economy, or basic history; one is a political expert simply based on the ability to “create jobs.” He is the Silicon Valley candidate, those true believers in unrestrained automation who believe they understand the economy better than everyone else because they’ve spent the most time sitting through meetings about “corporate synergy.”
“Sensible” policy must be in the center, as one of his slogans suggests: “Not Left, Not Right, Forward.” Yang, Warren, and Mayor Pete were considered “the smart candidates” by the media and many liberals. Primarily because they mirror back upper-middle class narcissism and promise not to disturb the security and comfort of the affluent. This just goes to show how simpleminded and anti-intellectual mainstream political commentary has become. Capitalism has had over 200 years to develop the chance to become “human centered.” It cannot because it is fundamentally set up to serve the profit motive over basic needs of people. Capitalist markets have always skewed the vast majority of benefits to the upper classes, with pipe dreams of wealth “trickling down” to the masses.
Yang could have made much more progress had he tacked harder to the left, but instead he falls prey to his belief in “human-centered capitalism.” His UBI proposal was popular; yet as an affluent business owner and stand-in for the entrepreneur class, he could not manage to go against his donors as well as his own interests by creating a framework for price controls to fight against inflation and parasitical price-gouging. Despite his concern over AI and automation leading to massive job loss, he does not fundamentally address the exploitative relationship between employer and employees, or understand how increased digital and robot-led production will lead to new levels of coercive labor monopolization of the means of production.
One Mike Weinstein explains Yang’s worldview quite well here, in a piece titled “Beware the Technocracy”:
Yang speaks the language of the ruling class, one of inscrutable economics to uphold the narrative of technology as savior. His aim is cloak this in popular socialist ideas such as universal healthcare and income. Yang promotes this package as a self-proclaimed ‘human-centered economy’. It’s worth noting that the robot antagonists in The Matrix had a human-centered economy, too.
Andrew Yang is a privileged tech-bro, but he had one thing going for him, he was earnest, somewhat open-minded, and willing to listen to others. In this piece, his interviewer sketches out the basics of accelerationism to Yang, implying that this is the first time Yang has heard of the idea, and Yang responds with interest, wanting to know more. Yang, unlike the rest of the moderates, might be a know-nothing; but at least he can have a human conversation, and is at least open to learning about new ideas.
His refusal to include a social safety net for the needy, disabled, and elderly that could stand to lose under his UBI, as well as his refusal to endorse Medicare for All, is further proof of his myopia, however. See this summary of his thought, published inBig Think, or this one, atTed.com, both of which specialize in big-brain centrism. Yang also proposed to raise revenue for the UBI via a value-added tax, which is a tax on consumption and disproportionately hurts low-income workers, rather than a more sensible wealth tax.
Warren: Feel-good candidate for the Professional-Managerial Class
Elizabeth Warren also tacked to the center, repeatedly describing herself as “capitalist to her bones”. While the act of adopting progressive liberal values and rhetoric mixed with pro-capitalist corporate-speak worked in the past, for instance, for Obama and even for Jimmy Carter before him, there is no popular “middle ground” to occupy now in the Democratic Party. The 2008 economic crisis advanced political consciousness in such a way that mainstream liberals now see the ground shifting underneath them. Either you are a firm Democratic establishment centrist, or you’re in the progressive/social democratic/democratic socialist camp.
Warren, straddling both sides of this fault line, could not seem to pick a lane. Her attacks on the banks and her wealth tax proposal would seem to mark her as a progressive, but her professional-managerial class (PMC) background pulls her to support the Clinton/Obama technocratic way of governing. Politics is about having big ideas and pointing out the systemic problems in society (which Bernie Sanders has, and does) and finding ways to implement them; not about having a series of band-aid solutions and incoherent plans for “structural change” without examining the root cause of our maladies: capitalism. No one wants to hear flip-flopping about a “transition plan” to shift to Medicare for All in three years. People want to know that you will fight for them on day one, because every day that you hesitate poor and homeless people literally die in the streets because of lack of access to health care; also men, women, and children are killed each day due to our imperial and frankly genocidal foreign policy, which she demonstrated hardly any basic knowledge of, or real interest towards.
Both Warren’s wealth tax and her climate plan were considerable tamer than Sanders’ plans. If you’re going to challenge corporate power, even within the confines of US electoral politics, you can’t excite the “populist” liberal-left with halfway measures. Voters were canny enough to see through her fence-sitting, hence her relative lack of support, even within her home state of Massachusetts.
One of Warren’s most glaringly dystopian plans was for “fighting digital disinformation”. There is a glimmer of a good idea hidden in the concept, in that she proposed penalties for those who engage in voter suppression. The real doozy is that she plans to criminalize “disinformation” and wants the corporate social media behemoths like Facebook and Twitter to censor and moderate political speech, as well as leaving the door open for government censorship of news. In this she parrots the desires of the Democratic establishment who, of course, are deeply entwined with the Military-Industrial-Intelligence complex. Liberal establishment figures have become emboldened since 2016: for instance Hillary Clinton views anyone who disturbs her as being aided by Russia; such as Trump, but also Jill Stein and Tulsi Gabbard, absurdly. Liberals such as Warren aim to increase paranoia in the populace, consciously or not, surrounding the idea of “foreign meddling” and seek to weaponize the election interference narrative against any politicians who do not support the ruling class. This is why Bernie Sanders was told his campaign was being aided by Russia, in effect to smear his entire campaign. The real targets in the “interference” narrative are leftists who want to redistribute wealth.
Agent Pete
Pete Buttigieg represents a special type of stupid. First, Buttigieg’s policies (or lack thereof) show just how worthless a Rhodes scholar-level education truly is, just like it showed for Cory Booker. Just like Kamala Harris, Buttigieg is the offspring of a worldly and erudite Marxist professor who didn’t learn a thing; in Mayor Pete’s case, he decided to rebel against his father and workfor the machinein the killing fields of Afghanistan and the corrupt scandal-ridden firm McKinsey.
There is much more to the Mayor Pete back-story regarding his intelligence and national security connections. He worked in Naval Intelligence in Afghanistan alongside the CIA. He penned an op-ed inThe New York Timeswith a friend about visiting Somaliland and meeting with “local leaders.” He keeps a map of Afghanistan displaying its mineral resources in his study (the alarm bells should be going off). He wrote in his book about visiting a “safehouse” in Iraq. Many foreign policy and national security figures backed his candidacy. And yes, thanks to Left Twitter, #CIAPete was blowing up on social media.
Whether or not Mayor Pete is a spy asset or not does not really matter. What matters is hethinks like them,and shares their worldview of supporting US imperial and economic domination at all costs.
How do we know this is true? Buttigieg had a line in a recent debate about “being inclusive” by taking donations from billionaires. Who honestly thinks taking money from billionaires is to make society more inclusive? Only a little slug willing to completely debase himself to his ruling-class overlords would admit this publicly; even Biden at his most incoherent would never blurt this out.
Listening to Pete talk in general was just bewildering. He imitates Obama’s style at every turn, yet cannot match his soaring oratory and simply does not answer questions or deliver any tangible idea of what he will offer. He is the platitude candidate; every time he speaks it’s like opening a fortune cookie, as he’s full of vague truisms.
One of the most dystopian plans of Pete was a “National Service Program”. Predictably, it is framed with patriotic, nationalistic rhetoric. The goal would be to increase the service program with the end goal being a “universal, national expectation of service” (from his website) while also claiming it will be “strictly optional”. High school and college students are already exploited enough in the classroom and at their jobs, and funding a plan so that young people can put a gold star on their resume pretty much sums up Pete in a nutshell. Here’s his justification:
In the great unwinding of American civic society underway, and at a time when Americans are experiencing record-low trust in fellow citizens and American institutions, few — if any — single policy solutions carry the promise of democratic renewal more than national service.
A simple rebuttal would be to ask what is causing the “unwinding” and “record-low trust”. It’s obviously inequality, corruption in government, corporations which are legally bound to choose profits over people, little to no regulation of technology and fossil fuel corporations, monopolization in virtually every sector of the economy, lack of health care and a living wage. There is no indication that this plan would solve any of these issues, because the Oxford-educated Mayor cannot be bothered to think critically. Or, rather, an Oxford education blinds one to the fact that capitalism is the root cause of our systemic crises. Typical of elites, he confuses class conflict with national frailty and disunity, much like Trump. He is a true believer in the system, and projects his privileged fake-meritocratic upbringing onto everyone around him with a call to service. Any national service plan with Pete at the helm feels like a plan for assimilating youth into our Death Star corporate-driven empire; for creating a “McKinsey Youth” for America.
Steyer and Bloomberg: Upholding a Nation Run for Plutocrats, by Plutocrats
Today one must be for the poor and working classes to gain mass political popularity, like Sanders; or conversely offer a proto-fascist program of a return to national greatness, like the racist, money-worshipping, chauvinist Twitter troll, like Trump. That is why the elites are even more afraid of Sanders, because he and more crucially his base offer a clean break and a qualitatively better and more egalitarian organization of society.
The super-rich must be excluded from the political process because they will always put the interests of capital above the common good, and refuse to see how their actions directly contribute to the impoverishment of workers and the degradation of the environment. Any intervention by them, in the name of philanthropy or donations to politicians, proves that their money buys political power, social control, and makes a mockery of any notion of “democracy” in this nation. This is called an oligarchy. Which reminds me, Mike Bloomberg should no longer be addressed as “Mayor Bloomberg”; “Plutocrat Bloomberg” or “Oligarch Bloomberg” would be more appropriate.
Amy’s Rage
Amy Klobuchar is a lot of things. She is undoubtedly driven, hard-working, and passionate about her work. The problem is the work she does is inherently bad for most people and she did not have any good policy ideas that differentiated her from the other centrists. Her other problem is that she hasextremeanger issues.
Klobuchar is an abusive boss and her employees described her offices in Minnesota and D.C. as a “hostile work environment.” The most she’s addressed this is by stating she’s “tough” and has “high expectations” for her staff. The clues to her barely-bottled rage are under the surface, as this article inThe Atlanticopines: her childhood spent with a neglectful, alcoholic father severely messed her up.
This is not an uncommon situation, with a subset of leaders put into positions of power that were traumatized in childhood. Many become highly-driven over-achievers in the corporate and political worlds: it’s easier to run from the ghosts when you’re showered with accolades and money. Many also burn with rage, are vengeful and prone to irrational outbursts, consider any slight or unavoidable accident a personal affront, and crave domination and control over others. Much like management in large corporations, her former staff describes a brutal hierarchical and tyrannical environment where the smallest mistake could set her off into tantrums or the throwing of office supplies, forcing staff to do demeaning work involving her personal effects, and would regularly condescend and shame her employees openly in person and through email. We already have an authoritarian in the White House who needs psychological counseling. Klobuchar should not be attempting to seek power: like the rest of the corporate and political ruling classes, she should be seeking professional help.
Biden: Senior Moments
Let’s just get it out of the way: Joe Biden is seriously slipping upstairs. I suppose that’s not an anomaly anymore for presidential politics, as we have dealt with cognitive decline before with Reagan in his second term. We’ve dealt with not-so-bright presidents too: the entire George W. Bush presidency, and now Trump. If Biden becomes the nominee and president it will be a national, collective senior moment. I don’t really have the words to describe a head-to-head Biden-Trump debate, other than it being extremely depressing, and that I would predict an increase in sales of alcohol. It would break the country on some visceral level. Nominating Biden could end the Democratic Party for good, so maybe there would be a silver lining.
Interestingly, Biden spoke to donors in 2019 and stated that “no one’s standard of living would change” and “nothing would fundamentally change” if he became elected. It would make for an honest slogan, at least. Vote Biden in 2020: Nothing will change.
When moderate democrats say “be realistic”, say it back to them: be realistic, Biden would surely lose to Trump. Only Sanders has a shot at defeating him, as Trump would absolutely eviscerate Biden and run circles around him. Even a broken clock is right twice a day, and Trump is as broken a person as they come; but he is smart enough to harp on Biden’s mental decline and his son’s shady job as a board member of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, a position he had absolutely no expertise in.
Oh Canada!?: Trudeau Marches for Climate
The most ridiculous and absurd example of big-brain centrism comes from our neighbor to the North, however. In September of 2019, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took part in a climate protest in Montreal. He tweeted: “Today we marched for our planet, our kids, and for their future.” It did not seem to dawn on him that his fellow citizens were marching to protest the lack of actionhis governmentwas taking to battle global warming. You’re their leader, Justin. If you want to take action, use every available mechanism inyour own governmentto make a change. The people put you in power to do exactly that. Was he protesting himself? Was he admitting that even as PM he is as powerless as the average citizen to fight the fossil fuel industries? Under his administration, Albertan oil sands continue to be extracted, and new pipeline expansion is in place against the will of the Wet’suwet’en First Nations tribe who are currently protesting.
The Moderates Serve the Ruling Class
Just to stick with Trudeau’s nastiness for a moment, everyone should read this article on the First Nation protestors in Canada fighting the Coastal GasLink Pipeline expansion. If you feel called, watch the embedded video. The RMCP point their rifles at nonviolent protestors- police who operate under the orders of Justin Trudeau. Make no mistake, Biden would be no different in the US. He serves at the behest of the ruling classes. It doesn’t matter if it’s Obama with Occupy Wall Street and the Dakota Access Pipeline, Trump, Trudeau, or a possible Biden regime: they all will intimidate and if necessary kill their own citizens who use direct action to resist fossil fuel expansion and corporate rule. It’s all a sick twisted game to protect the property of the rich for the “sensible”, “highly-esteemed”, blue-check mark politicians and media flunkies.
Even if the moderate liberals gave one single solitary fuck about average working people, the environment, future generations, and the citizenry they pander to, they are too weak-minded because they insist everything be done at the glacial pace (as glaciers are now in rapid retreat in many parts of the world this metaphor may no longer be useful, thanks to them) of bipartisan electoral politics, and will compromise with conservatives at every turn to water-down absolutely any and every possible progressive or radical legislative reforms.
Like Trudeau, they all want to have it both ways: to be seen as a progressive, “woke” politician; a radical climate protestor in his case, while at the same time being central figures of the establishment, upholding an inhumane system, walking corpses who prop up the status quo, absolute tools of corporate and imperial rule. Which in the end means that they really only care about themselves: their fame, power, glory, and their money.
Bernie Sanders has his own serious flaws, most especially in regards to foreign policy. Yet he is the only candidate who speaks to the need to create a better, kinder, more reasonable and egalitarian nation; and the best chance to popularize socialism right now, however ill-suited he may be to the task.
Even Hillary Clinton weighed in on Sanders recently and said “nobody likes him, no one wants to work with him.” It might be worthwhile for citizens and neoliberal imperialists like Clinton, Biden, Trudeau, and the rest to question what it means to be “popular” and what positive “work” has actually been accomplished in a Congress which hasn’t cracked a 30% approval rating in over 10 years.
There are a couple of references from pop culture which sum up the sad but true nature of the centrist liberal and conservative politicians. Their commitment to strengthening capitalism at all costs leads to a hollow shell of a life. The first quote is from the movieCasino Jack,a fictionalized version of the corrupt lobbyist Jack Abramoff’s life. When the walls are closing in on him, his wife reminds him there will be no one to help: “We have no friends, Jack, none. All we have are people we do business with.”
The second set of quotes, which I’ll end with, are from rap legend Tupac Shakur. In the song “Holler If You Hear Me”, 2pac warns of the perils of compromising one’s beliefs for material gain:
To the sellouts livin’ it up/
One way or another you’ll be givin’ it up.
In the last verse, 2pac has a prophetic line, alluding to black militancy, manufacturing consent and the return of the repressed in American society. His words remain eerily prescient, and remind me of the way moderate liberals and conservatives view the rise of Bernie Sanders and socialism in the US today as dangerous:
And now I’m like a major threat/
‘Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget"

Moscow immediately qualified these accusations as “gratuitous”.
Russian diplomacy spokeswoman Maria Zakharova thus denounced on March 19 ""an immoral attempt to hide via unfounded accusations her own inability to fight"" against the pandemic in Europe.
""It is not the first time that the EU has sought to blame Moscow for some of the problems it faces,"" she said.
“If there are charges, there must be evidence. If there is no evidence, no charges can be brought, especially for carrying out such an aggressive attack, ""said Zakharova.

According to Josep Borrell, ""a campaign of disinformation on the Covid-19 is ramping up and its source is either in Russia, or can be attributed to entities identified as pro-Kremlin"".
The US administration had already made similar charges in February.

Kerstin Hessius, director of the state-owned investment fund operating with pension funds, said that restricting socio-economic life would be a greater disaster than coronavirus, as many companies go bankrupt and leave the market.
Hessius called the ban on public meetings and restrictions on the movement of citizens in other countries a panic mood, indicating that if the Swedes stay at home instead of work, the state will wallow in huge debts that will have to be paid by future generations. Hessius is shared by Treasury Secretary Magdalena Andersson, who is in contact with business.
Trying not to lose the rating among voters, the ruling Social Democratic Party, led by Prime Minister Stefan Leuven, enlisted the support of the opposition Moderate Coalition Party. Its leader, Ulf Christersson, no longer criticizes the government, but speaks of the need to take into account the economic consequences of coronavirus.
Andreas Fischer, head of the Stockholm hospital workers union, criticized the actions of Leuven’s office and called for care primarily about the health of citizens, not profit.
By claiming the title of “social superpower,” Sweden was unable to adequately respond to the coronavirus epidemic. The country has 1929 infected and 23 dead. All universities are closed, but kindergartens and schools are open so that working Swedes have a lot to give their children to. Testing of persons with symptoms of coronavirus is not carried out, because of which the real number of patients cannot be established.
In many countries, the situation is no better. In Spain, due to a lack of medical personnel and medicines, doctors were ordered to save first of all those patients whose chances of recovery are higher.
In the United States, the state of New York (419 dead) became the epicenter of the spread of the epidemic. The mayor of New York, Bill De Blasio, in an appeal to residents said that if ten days later the next batch of medicines and equipment does not arrive at the hospital, patients will begin to die.
In Switzerland, 7,000 patients, 60 deaths. In Belgium, 3400 patients, 75 deaths. In Austria, 3611 patients, 25 deaths. In France, 20,000 patients, 860 deaths, 5,000 prisoners are about to be released, due to the threat of the spread of coronavirus in prisons. In Spain, 33089 patients, among them almost 4000 health workers. 1263 died, and over the past day a record number - 462 people.

In less than a week, the virologists from the Novosibirsk State Scientific Center “Vector” have developed a diagnostic test system for a new dangerous coronavirus from Wuhan, China, which will allow it to be detected at an early stage of the disease.
But it's too early to talk about creating a vaccine. State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin instructed the Duma Health Protection Committee to work out antiviral measures for the country.
A new type of coronavirus with the scientific name 2019-nCoV was discovered at the very end of last year in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. To date, in China itself, nine people have died from pneumonia caused by the virus, and the number of cases is close to five hundred. A positive reaction to the Wuhan death tests was revealed in patients in South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Singapore.
Recently, the first infected with a new virus was discovered in the United States. It turned out to be a Chinese tourist. Experts believe that the number of people infected with coronavirus, but not yet discovered around the world can go to thousands. Chinese doctors have officially confirmed that the new virus can be transmitted not only through contact with animals, as previously assumed, but also from humans - that is, by airborne droplets.
On the eve of the first ""suspected"" Chinese tourist with a high temperature was taken off the flight at the Khabarovsk airport. After his emergency hospitalization and blood test, it turned out that he was infected with the usual seasonal flu (virus A H1N1). Doctors breathed a sigh of relief, but were not going to relax. All passengers arriving from Southeast Asia are scanned with thermal imagers at airports for elevated temperatures. Hospitals in the Amur Region are on full alert. Similarly, throughout the country - especially in large transport hubs - preventive measures are being taken. In particular, sanitary-quarantine control at checkpoints across the state border has been strengthened, and the epidemiological situation has been monitored on a daily basis.

Surprisingly quickly - less than seven days after the publication of information about the genetic passport of the virus - the specialists of the Vector scientific center, which is part of the Rospotrebnadzor system, created “means for laboratory diagnosis of a new pathogen,” the department said.
Novosibirsk has developed two independent diagnostic kits, the action of which is based on the molecular genetic method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using one, you can directly detect the 2019-nCoV virus at an early stage, and the second to diagnose another dangerous disease that humanity has previously encountered is SARS, also called SARS. The PCR method is extremely sensitive: it can even detect single copies of viruses in just 2-4 hours. For this, a small smear from the nasopharynx is enough. Thus, express diagnostics can be carried out right on the spot in the compact laboratories of the Centers for Hygiene and Epidemiology of Rospotrebnadzor scattered throughout the country.
Recall that ""Vector"" is one of the largest scientific virological and biotechnological centers in Russia and in the world, organized back in 1974. Here, one of our first test systems for diagnosing HIV and hepatitis B, the first genetic engineering human a2b interferon in Russia, was developed and started to be produced here; the immunostimulating drug ""Ridostin"" and many other unique medicines, which indicates the continued high level of our microbiologists, despite the long-term pogrom of science.
“It is impossible to develop a vaccine in a week,” explained the former head of Rospotrebnadzor, State Duma deputy, doctor of medical sciences Gennady Onishchenko, explained to Tsargrad. - Evaluation of effectiveness also takes time. We need to work on the vaccine, if only from the point of view of pure science, for the future. But as a defense system, it cannot yet be evaluated. This is the seventh edition of the coronavirus, known to mankind since 1965. Our country still has not used vaccination against them. It must be understood that different infections require total or regional vaccination only in the event of a disease. In this case, there is no such need. ”
In the Russian laboratory, surprisingly quickly developed two diagnostic kits, the action of which is based on the molecular genetic method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Photo: Anton Veselov / Shutterstock.com
“No, Wuhan is not far from us,” Onishchenko retorts our “soothing” question. - The city is closer than it seems to many. After all, we are talking about a severe acute respiratory infection, which is very easy to transmit - I got on a plane, and after a few hours the virus is already here. Therefore, by the way, I would have refrained from traveling to China. ”
One of the past mutations of the coronavirus, called SARS, or “SARS,” said Gennady Grigoryevich, in the early 2000s, 9,000 patients and 700 dead people were noted. Therefore, in any case, one must be on guard. Of course, there is no reason to panic either.
But this natural or intentional, man-made mutation of the coronavirus remains to be seen. The fact that this is another attack of the coronavirus can be caused by the use of bioweapons, suggested a former member of the UN biological weapons commission and adviser to the organization’s secretary general Igor Nikulin. He recalled the high-profile scandal of 2010, when one of the 400 military bio-laboratories scattered around the world, owned by the US Navy, was closed in Indonesia, because secret experiments with bird flu were conducted there. The virus, leaving the laboratory walls, caused an outbreak of a dangerous disease, and the Yankees refused to transmit information about their sinister work to the Ministry of Health of Indonesia.
Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) is holding an emergency meeting in connection with the outbreak of a new coronavirus. Experts from Rospotrebnadzor also participate in it, as Elena Yezhlova, head of the epidemiological surveillance department of this federal service, said today. The result of the meeting should be an assessment of the degree of threat of a pandemic, as well as recommendations to medical and sanitary services around the world.
We continue to monitor the situation.

Stone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM waves, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: ""Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate.""
He added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to sow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations.
According to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is linked to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain ""mandatory vaccinations.""
Stone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations.
Gates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis such as coronaviruses, to the extent of recent talk about Gates's prediction of the disease 3 years ago.

Many questions have been raised about the fact that the disease has spread in Iran, and that the process of intimidation in the numbers of infected people has started to put a new constraint added to the siege that it has been in for years.
Observers believe that there are many question marks about the most affected countries and the nature of their political and economic relations with Washington, and that the coming days will reveal many
Imad Absence, author and Iranian political analyst, told Sputnik, ""Unfortunately, Iran is under a new blockade of Corona alongside the American blockade, and there is a media campaign led by Washington to terrorize the Iranian interior through the amplification of casualties, which leads to a conflict of information whether it is correct."" Or incorrect, there is some kind of intense fear
The political analyst added, and the Iranians fear that there will be a kind of quarantine on Tehran in addition to the current blockade and the closure of all borders and ports with it, and today we see many countries have stopped their flights to Tehran, we need today to be accurate in the information and speed of treatment and response to this disease
Absence continued, as a result of all this intimidation, you find, if you go to the Iranian street today, everyone wears gags, and even sterilization materials have disappeared from the market due to the increased demand for them.
Absence pointed out that there are big question marks about the spread of the disease in countries opposing or competing with the United States of America, and two months before the emergence of Corona in the Chinese city of Wuhan, there were American health exercises in the city in which 250 American soldiers participated, and there are talk that this virus It was published by them, and there are those who talk about seeing that the Americans could have spread the virus, and there are those who talk about it was Trump who gave orders to publish this epidemic.

Elena Malysheva, the famous Russian presenter and presenter, enumerated some nutrients that can boost the body's immunity to fight the infection of the Coruna virus.
During one of her televised medical programs, Malysheva said: ""Food products that contain large amounts of zinc are necessary to activate the so-called killer cells in the body. These cells, according to doctor Andre Prodius, are tasked with killing other cells infected with the virus.""
The doctor indicated that a person can get this important component from different foods such as shellfish, oats and corn flakes.
According to Malysheva, the elderly with diabetes are among the most at risk of corona, due to the symptoms that may cause zinc deficiency in their bodies, which may affect the work of their immune system.
The doctor advised those suffering from cardiovascular diseases and cancer patients to add the Brazilian nuts to their diet as it contains selenium, which is considered an anti-oxidant and an important component to strengthen the immune system.
She also stressed the need to drink more water, especially for the elderly, and she explained that dehydration and lack of fluids helps increase the concentration of viruses and germs in the body.

A Russian expert does not rule out the arrival of Corona from space, today Monday 23 March 2020 02:54 PM
News website 24 The head of the department of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Vyacheslav Eileen, believes that the SK virus is not excluded from falling into a meteorite on Chinese soil.
""The famous external biologist from Cardiff University in Wales, Chandra Wickrasingh, announced a few days ago that he did not rule out that the Corona virus had fallen to the ground with a meteor that exploded over China in October,"" Eileen told Russian news agency ""Novosti"". October 2019. ""
""Is this possible,"" the Russian expert said in response to a question from the agency's correspondent.
He added, ""A study must be conducted to synthesize the DNA of similar viruses during a long flight into space. Such an experiment is planned for the years 2023-2024 when the Bion-M No. 2 is launched.""
This experiment involves the launching of a rocky ""meteorite"", on which the outer surface contains holes in which bacteria have high temperature resistant bacteria and some chemicals that can form the basis of the organic matter composition. The main goal of this experiment is to verify whether life on Earth has been brought from space.
He continued, ""This is a very exciting experience from the point of view of the possibility of transporting biological materials, including nucleotide chains, which can be the basis for the synthesis of anything similar to viruses.""

An interesting report that throws oil on the fire of ""conspiracy theory""","This controversy escalated, especially between the United States and China, to the highest levels, as US President Donald Trump described it as a Chinese virus, while Beijing suspected that he was an American.
Although scientists and specialists are now busy combating this deadly epidemic, regardless of its source, and some confirm that there are no indications of its creation and that it is a ""natural"" virus known to ""lineage"", it was exposed to a mutation that turned it into a ""killer"" that has the ability to penetrate human cells, except A report published by the American journal, Nature, known for its sobriety, still threw more oil on ""conspiracy theory"" oil.
This report was published on November 12, 2015, and reported that US scientists have created in the laboratory a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats in connection with a virus that causes SARS, that is, acute respiratory syndrome.
The magazine revealed about 5 years ago that scientists had examined a virus called ""SHC014"", which was found in horseshoe bats in China.
These scientists combined the surface protein of ""SHC014"" with the SARS virus, and came out with a new virus that provided the surface protein with a structure that helps it penetrate into the cells of the human respiratory system. It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.
In this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans.
Researchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, ""may be more common than previously thought.""
In contrast, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify ""potential risks"".
Simon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on the news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: ""If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.""
In October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on ""job promotion"", especially those causing serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans."

https://www.eshraag.com/1.7.89/217603.html,New conspiracy theory: Bill Gates behind the genesis and spread of the Corona virus,"Roger Stone suggested on Monday that Bill Gates might have had a hand in creating the Corona virus and spreading the pandemic throughout the world. Former Donald Trump adviser indicated that American billionaire Bill Gates might have done this so he could grow microchips in people's heads to distinguish who was tested for COVID-19 and not tested. Stone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM waves, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: “Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate,” according to Russia today, citing the New York Post.
Electronic chips
He added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to sow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations. According to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is related to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain ""mandatory vaccinations."" Stone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations.
You also find the indication that the news of a new conspiracy theory: Bill Gates behind the origins and spread of the Corona virus has already been published on Saudi News and was quoted by the Ishraq News team and the original source is concerned with the health of the news or not.

The rapid spread and diversification of infectious epidemics globally since the beginning of the third millennium imposes a number of questions about the truth of their scientific roots, in the first place, and the political and strategic dimensions of all mankind from the directions of countries producing biological weapons arsenals, led by the United States.
On these days in January 2012, an international conference convened by the United Nations in Geneva to develop mechanisms for monitoring biological weapons failed, in which the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, delivered a speech “encouraging the ongoing efforts to protect humanity from the specter of biological weapons.” Strongly rejected the establishment of international restrictions to verify the safety of the world.
John Bolton preceded him in his official position as Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, 2001, by rejecting the investigation system that the United Nations reached after painful years of negotiations, in whole and in detail, saying: “The United States will simply not enter into agreements that would allow Rogue states or others develop and deploy biological weapons. ”
Three countries are internationally ""trusted"" to implement the Biological Weapons Convention concluded in 1975 with the signature of 165 countries: Russia, Britain and the United States to receive complaints and suggest solutions.
Among the scientific complaints received by the “Big Three,” December 9, 2001, was a briefing by the American human rights organization Ithaca to the Seventh International Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention. Stored in ""Sierra Army Depots,"" in northern California ""and possibly in other areas.""
It is noteworthy that the then US administration introduced ""Article 817"" to the articles of the Patriot Act, 2001, whereby the government would allow the development and storage of biological weapons and their release systems without restrictions, that is, a practical abolition of the texts of the international agreement signed on it.
What is striking and disturbing is what was predicted by the then Deputy Minister of Homeland Security, Daniel Gerstein, addressing the aforementioned international conference, 2012, that his country ""expects an outbreak of a pandemic by the end of 2013."" “Diagnosis” was shared by Dr. Joseph Kim at the Enuvio Vaccine Production Company.
The official American prediction of a pandemic before it occurred raised a range of questions and speculation about the dangerous extent of the biological weapons program and its threat to the lives and welfare of large numbers of people.
Hollywood was accompanied by the production of a movie called Contagion in 2011, which revolves around a pandemic caused by bats, according to the prepared scenario, which is currently taking place with the Corona pandemic in China, which is likely to be the source of the virus in Wuhan.
In the context of the American “prediction”, China was exposed in 2013 to a massive wave of “bird flu - H7N9,” which immediately started to exterminate millions of chicken birds and the negative repercussions it left not only on its economy, but at the global level to ban trade and dealing with Beijing. Repeat it these days also.
On January 31, the US government announced that it had implemented ""new measures to combat the Corona virus, including preventing Chinese citizens from entering"" its territory, and applying quarantine to individuals coming from there.
“Cuba in 1971 was the first country in the Caribbean to announce its exposure to a dengue epidemic. It is believed that its source came from Spain.” That was the summary of a 2009 medical publication from the prestigious US Institutes of Health. Cuba, in turn, accused the US government of spreading the epidemic that infected its livestock from pigs and of having to exterminate half a million heads.
Scientifically, the Corona virus infects the human respiratory system, similar to the previous SARS epidemic - acute pneumonia - and the origins of the two strains are from animals transmitted to humans, and then to its human brother; And spread to Saudi Arabia in 2012, causing severe pneumonia to the patient.
Some experts in the field of biological sciences suggest that the US government will engage in ""designing a biological attack against China for geopolitical considerations,"" coinciding with the spread of ""a new and dangerous epidemic"" with Chinese New Year celebrations to paralyze the Chinese society, the vast majority of whom will use transportation to return to their original villages.
Professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, Richard Eberat, expressed to the Washington Post his doubts about the American source because ""the genome of the virus and its properties do not indicate that it is the kind produced"" in the laboratory.
The newspaper and US circles in general have accused China of developing biological weapons in the Wuhan facility for ""engaging in espionage actions to obtain biological components.""
Early this week, he recorded a federal court filing an indictment against Harvard professor Charles Lieber “and two people of Chinese nationality for trying to smuggle 21 tubes containing biological materials to China;” and Lieber receives a monthly reward of $ 50,000 from Wuhan Technical University, according to the indictment.
What reinforces the hypotheses of the American source of the virus is the Trump administration’s policy to fight China by all means, starting with trade wars, and also subjecting it to a series of “deadly bacterial attacks, viral diseases, and symptoms targeting both livestock and humans.”
Epidemiologist at the Rand Institute, Jennifer Bowie, confirmed the close link between the two epidemics (SARS and Corona), as the ""compatibility ratio between them is at least 70% of genetic material and transmission mechanisms ... The mortality rate for those with SARS is about 10%, compared to 3"" % For Corona virus. ”
Bowie praised the transparency of scientists and the Chinese government and the “sharing of international scientific edifices with the genome data of the virus,” and reached them to find the causes within a short period of time, not exceeding a few days, which will contribute to developing an effective vaccine soon.
The American epidemiologist, Dina Grayson, expressed concern about a set of facts surrounding the Corona virus, especially the high speed of its spread from person to person.
It is worth noting that Corona virus is a US product with distinction, according to the registry of invention submitted in 2015, which was approved in 2018.
https://patents.google.com/patent/US10130701B2/en?oq=10130701
In the same context, there are strange ""separate"" incidents that targeted China originating in North America; the most prominent of which was the shipment arrival of a source from Canadian biological laboratories, in the month of March 2019, which included ""viruses,"" Canadians claimed that it is ""part of the research efforts to support public health research in the world . ” It is noteworthy that this shipment was carried out under the veil of secrecy, in contrast to the usual procedures, which prompted the Chinese side to file a formal complaint.
A large US military delegation, consisting of 300 personnel, arrives in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on October 19, 2019, to participate in a military games festival hosted by China held there. On November 2, 2019, the first infection with the Corona virus was recorded in that province, and it later spread rapidly in December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days.
The cost of what China has been exposed to as a result of the epidemic is prohibitive by all measures: disruption of flights and the movement of trains and other transportation at the height of its largest and most important annual feasts; Daily and phenomenal business exchanges with the world.
In sum, who can answer the question of the identity of the beneficiary of all this can reach the heart of the matter: waging wars with biological weapons at a lower cost than nuclear engagement."

And more and more questions about the source of origin of COVID-19.
The virus bypasses countries that are aloof from the main problems of world politics, and spreads to territories where the interests of world players clash. Of course, other countries are also affected by the pandemic, but there is no need to talk about the particular danger to them.

The virus chose China, Iran, Italy and Spain as the main targets. In ticks between Spain and Italy - France. The virus affected their neighbors less or not at all. And in Mongolia, for example, on March 23, only one case of the disease was registered, although in the country there are as many Chinese as there are Mongols, and movement is going through the Sino-Mongolian border.
China is a strategic adversary of the United States. In connection with the pandemic, China stopped the production of several industries, GDP growth slowed down, the yuan fell. However, the PRC was able to counter the pandemic with a centralized, well-functioning infection localization system. At the same time, Beijing bought up its “junk bonds”, which fell in price, substantially compensating for losses in the international financial market. Now the number of newly diagnosed diseases in China is approaching zero, the authorities are already taking down control over the movement of people and goods between Hubei and the rest of the country. The human losses of the PRC (3,270 people per 1.4 billion people) are insignificant in percentage terms. The main conclusion: the country was ready for large-scale, effective mobilization activities in an emergency.
It suffers greatly from the invasion of the Iran virus, with which China has neither a common border nor a lively exchange of people. And in this case, the epidemic in Iran is beneficial to Washington, which refuses to lift anti-Iranian economic sanctions. Mortality from the epidemic in Iran more than doubled the world average and amounted to 7.8%. The US administration said that they would not allow Iran to sell oil for the purchase of medicines and equipment.
A situation similar to Iran could be in warring Syria. Both of these countries are objects of increased US interest.
Take Italy and Spain, the two countries in Europe most affected by the pandemic. The Italian government has entered into conflict with Brussels and does not make concessions on the payment of public debt and a deficit budget. The European Commission refused to approve the Italian version of the proposals on this issue. There was a threat of Italy's exit from the EU. Against this background, the drama is unfolding with the growth of the epidemic in the country of pines and pensioners. Italy sets a mournful record for the level of victims - more than 10% of deaths from the number of cases. In neighboring Austria, Switzerland, and Germany, the scale of the pandemic is incomparably smaller.
Roughly the same situation in Spain, which is constantly shaken by Catalan separatism.
Separately, we must talk about the drama that takes place in the United States. According to available information, by March 26, the United States of America came first in the world in the number of detected diseases of the coronavirus. Here the epidemic becomes the argument of the Democrats in the ongoing election campaign with Trump. Some media outlets predict America’s millions of sick people and hundreds of thousands of dead by summer-autumn, citing the following figures: for 330 million US citizens — 55 thousand infected and 379 dead. For comparison: the last three years, the number of deaths in road accidents in the United States has been at the level of 40 thousand people. Trump's trump cards are low unemployment and support for national business; the pandemic is a major blow to these components of America’s socio-economic situation.
The experience of China shows that the spread of coronavirus can be localized. It all depends, firstly, on the state of the healthcare system, and secondly, on the quality and speed of management decisions made by the authorities. Selectivity of the spread of the virus by country is a direct indication of its artificial origin. Another confirmation of this, we assume, will be the “invention” in the United States of the rescue vaccine against coronavirus immediately after the elections are held and a new (or new-old) president comes to power.

During a meeting with students and professors at the Institute of World Civilizations in Moscow today, Saturday, Zhirinovsky said that the new virus is spreading at a tremendous speed, from one continent to another.
He asked, “Is it really a new type of influenza? No, the talk is about an artificial crisis behind which the United States is acting, motivated by economic motives, as the Americans fear that they will fail the Chinese contest or catch up with them, at least.
Gerinovsky indicated that it is not the first time that such crises have occurred, recalling that new Corona virus outbreaks have precedents such as bird flu or a ban on the import of British beef.
He added: ""The situation will calm down within a month ... These campaigns were artificial, which led to the purchase of the required drugs in abundance, and there are those who earn billions of that, and they live mainly in Switzerland.""

Humane and democratic Europeans get rid of Moldavians as if they were strangers.
In the situation with the coronavirus epidemic in Moldova, the priorities of the country's external players were clearly manifested. Those who were considered to be “strategic partners”, “friends” and “development partners” in Chisinau were not up to par. But the so-called ""world aggressors"" - Russia and China extended a helping hand to our republic.
- The coronavirus reached Moldova a little late. The infection was brought from Western Europe, primarily from Italy, Moldovan migrant workers fleeing from there. At the same time, at least in some cases, European countries showed negligence: Moldavians were first expelled from hospitals, then they turned a blind eye to the fact that obviously sick people with obvious signs of infection were boarding a plane and flying to Moldova. They got rid of Moldavians as if they were “strangers”. And now, a week later, from the returning migrants, the virus began to spread already within Moldova. The epidemic has begun, ”political analyst Igor Tolmach said in an interview with REGNUM.
Moldova and its medical system, according to the political scientist, were absolutely unprepared for a harsh crisis situation similar to the invasion of the coronavirus COVID-19. And at this moment, assistance to the republic was offered not by those who over the past three decades have been called “development partners” and where Moldova is pursuing an “integration course” - not the EU and the USA. But Russia and China are the ones whom the various “European integrators” have cursed all these years together.
Tolmach reminded the proverb that “a friend is in need”, noting that it was Moscow and Beijing that sent humanitarian supplies to Moldova with medicines and medical equipment
- Crisis moments show who is worth what. And all right, Moldova and its citizens - they have never been considered in the EU as theirs. But the same thing is happening today with Italy, the country of the European Union. Not waiting for help from the “partners” in the EU, the Brussels bureaucracy and the USA, Italy received it all from the same China and Russia. That Russia, against which they so imposed sanctions in unison, accusing them of all mortal sins. The first serious crisis brought everyone to clean water. Will they draw conclusions from this - both in the EU national states, and in Moldova? - the expert wondered.

On Tuesday, Iran announced 135 new cases of the newly infected Corona virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths to the virus to 988.
""A total of 1,178 new HIV infections and 135 deaths have been recorded in the past 24 hours,"" Health Ministry spokesman Kyanosh Jahanpur told a news conference.
He pointed out that ""the number of people infected with the Coronavirus in Iran increased to 16,169, the deceased to 988, and those recovering to 5,389.""
On March 11, the World Health Organization classified the emerging Corona virus ""Covid 19"", which declared an outbreak in China at the end of last year, a pandemic, confirming that the numbers of infections are rising very quickly, as the infections in their latest update reached more than 200 Thousand in more than 160 countries and regions around the world, and deaths approached 8 thousand cases."
http://www.dampress.net/?page=show_det&category_id=102&id=97338,Suspicious facts accompanied Corona ... Who knew?,"The rapid spread and diversification of infectious epidemics globally since the beginning of the third millennium imposes a number of questions about the truth of their scientific roots, in the first place, and the political and strategic dimensions of all mankind from the directions of countries producing arsenals of biological weapons, led by the United States.
On these days in January 2012, an international conference convened by the United Nations in Geneva to develop mechanisms for monitoring biological weapons failed, in which the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, made a speech encouraging efforts to protect humanity from the specter of biological weapons; but she strongly rejected International restrictions to ensure the safety of the world.
John Bolton preceded him in his official position as Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, 2001, by rejecting the investigation system that the United Nations reached after exhausting years of negotiations, in whole and in detail, saying that ""the United States will simply not enter into agreements that would allow For rogue states or others to develop and deploy biological weapons. ""
Three countries are internationally ""trusted"" to implement the Biological Weapons Convention concluded in 1975 with the signing of 165 countries: Russia, Britain and the United States to receive complaints and suggest solutions.
Among the scientific complaints received by the ""Big Three,"" December 9, 2001, was a briefing by the American human rights organization Ithaca to the Seventh International Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention. It contained the United States' violation of the treaty due to its involvement in an activity related to the development of an offensive biological weapons program They are stored in Sierra Army Depots, in northern California and possibly in other regions. ""
It is noteworthy that the then US administration introduced ""Article 817"" to the articles of the Patriot Act, 2001, and it allows the government to develop and store biological weapons and their release systems without restrictions, that is, practically canceling the texts of the international agreement signed on it.
What is striking and disturbing is what was ""foretold"" by the then Deputy Minister of Homeland Security, Daniel Gerstein, addressing the aforementioned international conference, 2012, that his country ""expects a pandemic by the end of 2013"". The diagnosis was shared by Dr. Joseph Kim at the Enuvio Vaccine Production Company.
The official American prediction of a pandemic before it occurred raised a range of questions and speculation about the dangerous extent of the biological weapons program and its threat to the lives and welfare of large numbers of people.
The Hollywood community accompanied it with the production of a movie called Contagion in 2011, which revolves around a pandemic caused by bats, according to the prepared scenario, which is currently taking place with the Corona epidemic in China, which is likely to be the source of the virus in Wuhan Province.
In the context of the American ""prediction"", China was exposed in 2013 to a massive wave of ""bird flu - H7N9"", as it immediately began to exterminate millions of chicken birds, and this not only left negative repercussions on its economy, but at the global level to ban trade and dealing with Beijing. We are seeing it happening again these days.
On January 31, the US government announced its implementation of ""new measures to counter the Corona virus, including preventing Chinese citizens from entering its territory""; and applying quarantine to individuals coming from there.
“In 1971, Cuba was the first country in the Caribbean to announce its exposure to a dengue (dengue) epidemic, and it is believed to originate in Spain.” This was the summary of a medical bulletin issued by prestigious US health institutes in 2009. Cuba, in turn, accused the US government of spreading the epidemic Its animal wealth from pigs and it was forced to exterminate half a million heads.
Scientifically, the Corona virus infects the human respiratory system, which is similar to the previous SARS epidemic - acute pneumonia - and the origins of the two strains are from animals and have been transmitted to humans, and then to its human brother; , Due to its appearance and spread in Saudi Arabia in 2012, causing severe pneumonia to the patient.
Some experts in the field of biological sciences suggest that the US government will engage in ""designing a biological attack against China for geopolitical considerations"", coinciding with the spread of ""the new epidemic and danger"" with the Chinese New Year celebrations to paralyze Chinese society, a large majority of whom will use transportation to return to their original villages.
Professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, Richard Iberat, expressed to the Washington Post his doubts about the American source because ""the genome of the virus and its properties do not indicate that it is the kind produced in vitro"".
The newspaper and US circles have been charged with developing China for developing biological weapons in the Wuhan facility for a year, for ""engaging in espionage activities to obtain biological components.""
It was recorded earlier this week that a federal court directed an indictment against Harvard professor Charles Lieber and ""two people of Chinese nationality for their attempts to smuggle 21 tubes inside of biological material into China"", and Lieber receives a monthly reward of $ 50,000 from Wuhan Technical University, according to the indictment .
What strengthens the hypotheses of the American source of the virus is the Trump administration’s policy of fighting China by all means, starting with trade wars, and also exposing it to a series of “deadly bacterial attacks and viral diseases, and symptoms targeting both livestock and humans.”
The Epidemiologist at the Rand Institute, Jennifer Bowie, confirmed the close link between the two epidemics (SARS and Corona) as ""the compatibility ratio between them is at least 70% of genetic material and transmission mechanisms. The mortality rate for those with SARS is about 10%, compared to 3"" % For Corona virus "".
Boi praised the transparency of scientists and the Chinese government, and the ""sharing of the international scientific edifice with the genome data of the virus,"" and reached them to know the causes within a short period of time, not exceeding a few days, which will contribute to developing an effective vaccine soon.
The American epidemiologist, Dina Grayson, expressed concern about a set of facts surrounding the Corona virus, especially from the high speed of its spread from one person to another ""It is not only contagious, but kills the infected."" Grayson has long experience in developing drugs to treat the Ebola epidemic.
It is worth noting that Corona virus is a US product with distinction, according to the registry of invention submitted in 2015, which was approved in 2018.
In the same context, there are ""separate"" strange incidents that targeted China originating in North America; the most prominent of which was the shipment arrival of a source from Canadian biological laboratories, in March 2019, which included ""malicious viruses,"" which the Canadians claimed was ""part of the research efforts to support public health research."" In the world."" It is worth noting that this shipment was carried out under the veil of secrecy, in contrast to the usual procedures, which prompted the Chinese side to file a formal complaint in this regard.
A large US military delegation, consisting of 300 people, arrives in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China on October 19, 2019, to participate in a military games festival hosted by China and held there. On November 2, 2019, the first infection with the Corona virus was recorded in that province, and it later spread rapidly in December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days.
The cost of what China has been exposed to as a result of the epidemic is prohibitive by all measures: disruption of flights and the movement of trains and other transportation at the height of its largest and most important annual holidays; and the stricken Wuhan municipality imposed a ban on leaving the town on the population “only for emergency reasons; Everyday life and tremendous business exchanges with the world.
Ultimately, who can answer the question about who benefits from all this can reach the heart of the matter: waging wars with biological weapons at a lower cost than nuclear engagement."

The new world order government of course","Henry Kissinger, the Zionist pioneer of US imperial foreign policy, warned in an opinion piece that no government, not even its beloved hegemon, can defeat only Covid-19, implying that the New World Order he always preached must go on.
If the United States does not combine its efforts to rebuild its own economy with the first steps toward creating a global government, humanity is doomed, Kissinger wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed.
No country, not even the United States, can overcome the virus in a purely national effort, ""said Kissinger. ""Addressing the needs of the moment must ultimately be combined with a vision and a global collaborative agenda.""
If we cannot do both, we will face the worst of each.
Kissinger regrets that the pandemic has led to the return of a nationalist ""walled city"" model of government, suggesting that ""exploration at the frontiers of science"" alone can save humanity from disease in his vision of a utopia globalist. But developing cures takes time, and the idea that countries should be discouraged from protecting themselves in the meantime is suicidal. In any case, one of the reasons why Italy, Spain and France were so affected by the coronavirus was the EU's dysfunctional insistence on open borders in the midst of the pandemic.
""Global trade and the movement of people"" is all very well, but the pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of the globalist system like never before. Nations will take years to rebuild, and repeating their mistakes is not something they can afford.
While serving as Secretary of State and National Security Adviser under Presidents Nixon and Ford, Kissinger played a leading role in the bombing campaigns against Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos and oversaw regime change operations that placed brutal dictators in the power in Argentina and Chile, too. in support of state-sanctioned repression in Indonesia. A notorious report he wrote for the Ford administration called for dramatic reductions in population growth in developing nations. One would think, given his track record, that he would be on the side of the virus.
But the Nobel Peace Prize winner presents himself here as an experienced statesman who cares deeply for the future of humanity and calls on the United States to ""draw lessons from the development of the Marshall Plan and the Manhattan Project."" Of course, revisiting the Marshall Plan makes sense: there is no doubt that a new vision can be obtained of the reconstruction of the destroyed post-war economies of Europe, especially since some of the countries most affected by the epidemic are in Europe.
But the Manhattan project? How does a secret international doomsday project that produced weapons with unprecedented murder potential have any bearing on the coronavirus crisis?
It must be said that listening to Kissinger is what led to the USA. USA To his current situation: believing himself exceptional, distrusting all the world powers that do not swear absolute fidelity, repeating the same failed policies to the point of parody. With an impending presence in the George W. Bush administration, Kissinger advised the country to head straight into the ever-expanding war on terror, and wrote an editorial in the days after 9/11 that called for taking on ""any government that houses groups capable of this type of attack. « Following that guide has bankrupted the United States and turned it into a banana republic, frantically printing money as its roads and bridges crumble, its citizens struggle to keep a roof over their heads, and the international community gawks, while his government continues to give them a conference on human rights.
Kissinger concludes his Jeremiah with a warning that ""failure [to safeguard the principles of the liberal world order] could set the world on fire"". If, as he himself writes, ""the purpose of the legitimate state is to satisfy the fundamental needs of the people: security, order, economic well-being and justice,"" those principles collapsed long ago. The first step for the United States, after the pandemic, should be to put out the fires caused by Kissinger and those like him who seek to cover up the empire in the rhetoric of liberal democracy.

the health
The famous Soviet painter Alexei Kukuriken, twice winner of the Stalin Prize from India, returned to Moscow on New Year's Eve 1960, but died of a mysterious illness two days after his return.
60 years ago and in the early morning on the eve of New Years 1960, a plane arriving from India with Alexei Kukuriken, a painter, landed, and after he had finished crossing the border, he went to his girlfriend, suffering from a slight cough, and did not interest anyone in the winter.
The next day the painter went to his family to celebrate with them the New Year, and distributed gifts that he brought to them, but the cough became more severe and his temperature rose, so he had to see the doctors, who admitted him to hospital, then his condition worsened and he died in the evening.
The autopsy was revealed in the presence of an anatomist, who immediately announced that the painter had variola vera-smallpox. This disease was actually killing lives in the Middle Ages, but in the Soviet Union it had no effect. Because it was eliminated by universal vaccination in 1936. But it is still present in India, and there the painter was infected, during the burning ceremony of a person who died with smallpox.
After diagnosing the cause of death, the doctors discovered the nurse, the doctor who examined the painter in the hospital, and another patient in one of the corridors of the lower floor, as well as a hospital worker. After two weeks, they all had pain-like symptoms (fever, cough, and rash). The smallpox virus was discovered in a sample taken from the skin of a patient. This indicates that an untreated epidemic will hit Moscow and the entire Soviet Union.
Therefore, in an emergency meeting held on the same day in the presence of Khrushchev, comprehensive measures and measures were taken to prevent the spread of the epidemic.
The police and the State Security Committee were charged with exposing all the injured as soon as possible, from the moment the plane carrying the sick painter was landing. That is, this includes all passengers, crew, and workers at the airport, as well as his colleagues, relatives, friends and lover as well. The police, the State Security Committee and the Ministry of Health were able to collect all of them and completely isolate them and all those who contacted the painter and them during this period.
The isolation also included workers in stores and other service facilities who had been in contact with the painter’s relatives and sweetheart and were also isolated, and all the gifts and clothes that the painter brought from India were burned.
The hospital has turned into a total blockade, and none of the patients, the doctors, and all the staff can leave it for any reason. The hospital was provided with all necessary medicines, equipment, clothes and food. A plane that was on a flight to Paris was also returned to the airport, as one of the passengers on board the aircraft that carried the painter from India to Moscow was on board.
Among the measures that were taken to prevent the spread of the epidemic, Moscow closed and completely isolated it according to the laws of wartime, all flights and the movement of trains and cars were stopped, and the medical teams were working day and night and they were isolating every suspect in the hospital, where the number of 10 thousand people a week later had contacted Somehow the plane passengers come from India.
Meanwhile, the campaign to vaccinate the population with an anti-smallpox vaccine began in the country, where within three days health institutions in Moscow received 10 million vaccines against smallpox from the Tomsk and Tashkent Vaccine and Vaccine Institutes and the Krasnodar Regional and Epidemiological Health Station, where all the residents of Moscow and its guests were vaccinated.
In the end, it became clear that 7 of Kokorikin's relatives, 9 hospital staff and 3 hospital patients only had smallpox, and these were the cause of injury to 23 people, of whom only three died.
During this preventive campaign, 7 million Moscow residents and guests were vaccinated. The campaign was carried out by 10,000 medical teams, which included, in addition to doctors and nurses, students of medical institutes.
Within one month, the health authorities managed to completely eliminate smallpox. But this happened in another country that no longer exists! Do countries today see the blockade of the Coruna epidemic as the Soviet Union did at that time?

Trump was particularly bothered by Captain Crozier's assertion that the United States ""was not on the warpath,"" when the captain, who was fired today, urged that the aircraft carrier with 5,000 crew members should anchor in the port of Guam to attend to the infected. .
The truth is that the political storm in the United States that caused the defenestration of today's national hero, Captain Crozier, was contested by Tyrians and Trojans, and exposed the strategic vulnerabilities of the United States in the pandemic phase.
The geopolitical consequences of the infection of the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier - whose president was the one who enunciated the great club policy in the phase of the beginning of the US imperial irredentism - are enormous. They force to anchor the infected aircraft carrier, which served to contain China in the Pacific, and is replaced by another attack aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman, which was off the coast of Iran. Which fragilely leaves the US military presence in the Middle East when it has just closed its large Taqaddum air base in Iraq.
It is no small matter that the pandemic has reached the US Navy when, apparently, the COVID-19 infected the crews of four aircraft carriers, including the famous Nimitz.
Air Force General John Hyten, deputy director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Board, said the Pentagon was ready to operate in a ""COVID environment.""
At today's cash cut, the Pentagon says there are more than 3,100 infected and 64 hospitalized out of the 1.4 million service members.
One thing is clear: the Pentagon will not be stopped in its military deployments by COVID-19.
And for the avoidance of doubt, Pentagon Undersecretary David Norquist emphasized that the infected aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt remains in a ""state of combat"", even though it anchored at the Guam base - in Micronesia, in the western Pacific - by "" caution"".
Former Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly - an entrepreneur who was the manager of the controversial global accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers - stated that although the crew of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt is reduced to 1,000 out of 5,000 it would still constitute a unit willing to intervene militarily. .
If this is the case, discarding its hollow bravado, what is the reason, then, that the other USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier has been withdrawn from the coast off Iran to be redeployed in the Pacific instead of the infected carrier?
Precisely in the Pacific region, the US has deployed its aircraft carriers in order to intimidate China, including by nuclear means.
Beyond Modley's bluster, the actual crash of the affected and infected USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier forced the redeployment of the other USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier to take its place.
Since March 27, the Daily Mail, very close to British MI6, had exposed that, in addition to the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is located in the port of Tokyo, had ""quarantined all its crew ""So China now appears to have its hands free in the Pacific.""
Has the major scandal of the USS Theodore Roosevelt served to cover up the quarantine of the other USS Ronald Reagan, practically hidden?
It is unknown whether either or both of the crews of the two Chinese aircraft carriers exhibit any COVID-19 infection.
Now, of the 11 US aircraft carriers, the current greatest maritime superpower, it is striking that another, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, is deployed in the Middle East, while the USS Gerald R. Ford, commissioned by Trump, It is expected to be deployed in 2022.
The situation of the other six aircraft carriers that are anchored on the two coasts of the US is as follows:
- USS Carl Vinson, stationed in Washington state and with a Marine who tested positive for COVID-19;
- USS Nimitz, stationed in Washington State and with reports of some infected;
- USS Abraham Lincoln, parked in San Diego;
- USS George Washington, stationed in Newport (Virginia) and currently under repair;
- USS John C. Stennis, anchored in Norfolk, Virginia and currently under repair to be operable in the next decade;
- USS George HW Bush, which has a 28-month plan to be anchored in Norfolk (Virginia);
- USS Gerald R. Ford, commissioned by Trump, is expected to be deployed in 2022.
It is striking that at least three aircraft carriers are under repair, which significantly reduces the US naval power, even more so when at least three aircraft carriers have been hit by the pandemic.
Strange things have happened in the US Navy, such as when the collision between the USS Fitzgerald and USS John S. McCain ships with civilian ships that left 17 people dead due to negligence, in the summer of 2017.
Is the US on the verge of losing its invincible maritime supremacy?
THE AUTHOR'S OPINION DOES NOT NECESSARILY MATCH THAT OF SPUTNIK"
https://ge.news-front.info/2020/03/23/5695,"Russia has ""knocked out"" NATO. What will happen to NATO's ""large-scale"" exercises?","Russia, at the behest of Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko, has, in fact, ""swept"" Europe and NATO.
In particular, Russia called on European countries not to conduct NATO exercises Defender Europe-2020 until Russia celebrates the 75th anniversary of its victory in the Great Patriotic War. As it is known, the parade is scheduled for May 9 in Moscow. The Coronavirus pandemic will not be able to stop this parade, according to current data.
The ""irony"" is that European countries are in a difficult situation - not only from an epidemiological point of view, but also from a political one, when Italy and Spain were left in a difficult situation without help. The two countries are being assisted by Chinese and Russian specialists, with Chinese and Russian shipments of humanitarian supplies as Germany refused to export medical supplies and the United States cut off travel to the European Union. Against this background, what is the price of joint military exercises? How long should Western leaders continue to deceive their own peoples and themselves?
Coronavirus gave NATO its place. The U.S. military has already announced that the United States will limit its involvement in Defender Europe-2020, despite the fact that it has already deployed 6,000 troops and 12,000 vehicles and military equipment to Europe for training.
""In connection with the current Koronaviru19 explosion and the order of the Minister of Defense, we have changed the scale of the Defender Europe-2020 training. From March 13, the movement of military personnel and equipment from the United States to Europe has been completely stopped, ""the statement said.
The statement said that in addition to the tank brigade, all other US military forces that had previously been mobilized in Europe would be relocated to the United States to participate in the exercise.
NATO's ""largest"" military exercise has failed miserably."

New conspiracy theory: Bill Gates behind the origins and spread of the Coronavirus
Roger Stone suggested on Monday that Bill Gates might have had a hand in creating the Corona virus and spreading the pandemic throughout the world.
Former Donald Trump adviser indicated that American billionaire Bill Gates might have done this so he could grow microchips in people's heads to distinguish who was tested for COVID-19 and not tested.
Stone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: “Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate.”
He added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to sow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations.
According to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is related to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain ""mandatory vaccinations.""
Stone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations.
Gates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis such as coronaviruses, to the extent of recent talk about Gates's prediction of the disease 3 years ago.
The Washington Times also reported that Gates announced earlier this month that his charitable organization would invest billions of dollars in factories that would focus on developing many vaccines."

Washington should reveal its role in the production and spread of corona
Wed, 18 Mar 2020 12:37:43
Editor: Ali Al-Tamimi
Iran on Wednesday renewed its call to the United States of America to disclose its role in the production and dissemination of the emerging ""Corona"" virus (Covid 19).
Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran, Ali Shamkhani, published a tweet at his expense, in which he said, ""Washington must disclose its role in producing and publishing corona instead of making accusations against Iran and China, instead of Washington issuing false charges, it must talk about its ongoing crime against the Iranian people through its sanctions."" .
On Tuesday, Iran announced 135 new cases of the newly infected Corona virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths to the virus to 988.

The ban on exports of medicines and equipment from the European Union, introduced because of the coronavirus, showed that European solidarity does not exist. Such a loud statement on the eve was made by the President of Serbia, Alexander Vucic. In his opinion, the only country that can help Serbia in this situation is China. And he promised to “thank” the EU for such support.
US will not lift sanctions so easily - political analyst on Iran’s request >>
Sputnik Azerbaijan asked the associate professor of political science and sociology at the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, a member of the expert council of the Russian Officers and military analyst Alexander Perendzhiev, about what is happening today with Europe and where solidarity is constantly declared there.
- To begin with, what is your overall attitude to coronavirus? You, as a military expert, admit that this may be a kind of biological weapon, or such a version from the field of conspiracy theories?
- I am sure that coronavirus is a biological weapon and is spreading in the world primarily by artificial means. And then, through people infected with it, it is transmitted to others.
If coronavirus is the result of the fact that in China ""they eat something wrong,"" it turns out that they eat it wrong in Italy. I believe that the problem of coronavirus is not only a health problem. It is simultaneously a military and law enforcement problem.
That is, we are talking about distribution agents of coronavirus around the world. And, above all, in developed states. Therefore, it is necessary not only to urgently treat people, but also to identify the foci and pathways of the spread of the virus, and ultimately, the spreading agents, that is, in fact, sabotage pests.
For these purposes, it is necessary to create Coronavirus Centers for Countering Coronavirus in all countries, which should include departments for monitoring its spread and, most importantly, anti-virus investigation bureaus.
There is no doubt about the need for anti-crisis measures - Assistant to the President >>
The task of the latter should be a thorough investigation of specific cases of infection, identifying their causes and conditions. And, of course, the identification of sabotage agents in the spread of the virus.
- What is happening in Europe today? EU countries have already shown the whole world a complete lack of solidarity, and this is only pneumonia, but what if the war? It turns out that Europe is not ready for anything?
- The fact is that Europe has never been prepared to counter real threats. I and other Russian experts constantly warned Western, and, above all, European countries about the greater harm they spent on countering the mythical ""Russian"" threat of large assets, forces, human and other resources, as a result of which they would be completely helpless in repelling a real threat. Unfortunately, our forecast came true.
The spread of the coronavirus is very reminiscent of a terrorist threat, since in both cases it instills fear, horror, and panic in citizens.
However, the terrorist threat is more tangible, since it comes from specific performers armed with explosives, bombs and other weapons. Here, the enemy is more reminiscent of the plot from Herbert Wells's Invisible Man book. But this must also be able to courageously and skillfully counteract.
Nevertheless, European leaders, instead of reassuring their citizens and declaring their plans and measures taken to prevent the spread of coronavirus, are themselves subject to panic.
Of course, they have so boldly fought the non-existent Russian threat for so long that they absolutely do not understand how to deal with a specific viral threat. Moreover, in the absence of any instructions ""from above"".
Is there a threat to Azerbaijani-Russian relations? Pritchin answers >>
Now in the Russian expert community they even joke about how easy it is now to capture a frightened Europe! But this is only a joke. But seriously, we must unite with Europe in the fight against the spread of infection by creating joint Centers for the fight against coronavirus, of which I spoke above.
- Given the massive closure of borders, the conclusion suggests itself that the Defender 2020 exercises are in question. Is it likely that they may not take place? And are they needed in principle, if European countries have already shown everything to everyone?
“Defender 2020, as I said, is a defense exercise against a non-existent threat. I would like to advise our “partners” to pay attention to the antiviral exercises of the radiation chemical and biological defense troops (RCHB) of the Russian Armed Forces.
During them, new RXM-6 reconnaissance chemical machines and ARS-14 auto-filling stations were tested, designed to identify the biological threat at the initial stage and to take the necessary measures to localize and eliminate the consequences of a viral infection.
Maybe now it makes sense in this form to conduct such exercises? Or maybe, together with Russia?"
https://www.sarayanews.com/article/608198,New conspiracy: Bill Gates is behind the spread of Corona,"16-04-2020 02:24 AM
Roger Stone suggested on Monday that Bill Gates might have had a hand in creating the Corona virus and spreading the pandemic throughout the world.
Former Donald Trump adviser indicated that American billionaire Bill Gates might have done this so he could grow microchips in people's heads to distinguish who was tested for COVID-19 and not tested.
Stone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM waves, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: ""Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate.""
He added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to sow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations.
According to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is linked to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain ""mandatory vaccinations.""
Stone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations.
Gates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis such as coronaviruses, to the extent of recent talk about Gates's prediction of the disease 3 years ago.
As the Washington Times reported, Gates announced earlier this month that his charitable organization would invest billions of dollars in factories that would focus on developing many vaccines."

So Kay Bailey Hutchinson commented on the actions of the Russian military in Italy and Russia's humanitarian assistance to the United States. Somewhere from these words the Baltic countries cried, for which membership in NATO without Russia in the image of a common enemy has no benefit.
“Now is the time of the humanitarian crisis, the health crisis. Any help we can provide to each other, we must provide, ”said US Permanent Representative at NATO Headquarters Kay Bailey Hutchinson during a telephone briefing from Brussels.
According to Hutchinson, ""if we can, we have the opportunity to help each other, we must and will (help).""
So the American diplomat answered the question of whether she is embarrassed that the Russian radiation, chemical and biological defense forces are carrying out a humanitarian operation in a NATO member country - Italy?
Washington may be embarrassed by this, but the US envoy will not oppose it after US President Donald Trump asked Vladimir Putin. At the Kennedy airport, a Russian military plane with humanitarian aid has already landed, and the rescue mission of the Russian Armed Forces on the streets of New York every day becomes as relevant as in Bergamo.
In such circumstances, America cannot demand because of the NATO allies not to forget about the “Russian threat” because of the pandemic.
Therefore, the United States believes that NATO and Russia should unite against the coronavirus.
The State Department’s latest statements regarding Russia have sinned with pro-Russian notes that were not there in the past 10 years. “Both countries provided humanitarian assistance to each other during the crisis in the past and will undoubtedly do so in the future. This is the time to work together to overcome the common enemy that threatens the life of each of us, ”says, for example, a message from the US Foreign Ministry on April 2.
At the same time, the State Department emphasizes that Russia is reducing its nuclear potential, and faster than the United States.
Such recognition creates diplomatic ground for negotiations between Putin and Trump on the extension of the strategic offensive arms limitation treaty (START-3), which the American side has so far refused.
NATO as an instrument of pressure on Russia in the new conditions is temporarily irrelevant. Moreover, the North Atlantic Alliance is inadequate as a means of combating the epidemic. In recent weeks, the military-political bloc has shown its complete futility. In Italy, in Spain and further everywhere.
Directing NATO forces to fight the coronavirus is a self-evident solution. However, allies on both sides of the Atlantic alone are unable to cope with COVID-19. Practice has shown that non-Western countries fight the pandemic much more effectively than Western countries.
Therefore, combining efforts with Russia is expedient and profitable. So it is possible to save human lives and prove that the existence of NATO makes sense.
However, there is one interested party, which unites the efforts of Russia and NATO across the throat. This is the Baltic states.
Membership in NATO is beneficial to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia only if the North Atlantic Alliance is aimed at confronting Russia - this is the only concept for the existence of NATO, in which the Baltic States can count on the influx of money and investment.
If the probable adversary of NATO is not Russia, but someone else - Islamic terrorism, coronavirus, it doesn’t matter - the rich allies lose all reason to invest in the Baltic countries. To develop their infrastructure: repair roads and build bridges. Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn will only have to demonstrate discipline, increase military spending ... and not get anything in return.
Meanwhile, lobbying for financial injections into the Baltic states for military purposes is ongoing. Just the other day, the American Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) released a report stating that NATO troops will not be able to quickly repel Russian aggression in the Baltic states, as the dilapidated road infrastructure in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia limits the speed of movement of military equipment. The conclusion is obvious: do not hide your money!
The Baltic countries themselves knocked out the “military Schengen” program in Brussels for several years. The goal is the same - the modernization of the transport network for the accelerated movement of NATO troops. Financing - from the funds of the European Union.
Even before the epic with the coronavirus, Western Europe showed the Baltic application “nevermind”: in the draft seven-year budget of the EU, funding for the “military Schengen” program was cut to zero.
Now the United States also stabbed the Baltic allies in the back, urging NATO to unite with Russia in the fight against coronavirus.
Of course, Russia can help the Baltic countries in the fight against coronavirus. They can now accept this help: ""the elder ordered."" But for Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn, this is little consolation. If at all consolation: still, what good, they are occupying ... What can we say about the long term. The Baltic countries for the West in isolation from the ""Russian threat"" simply do not exist. And because of this damn coronavirus, the West simply “scored” both the “Russian threat” and the Baltic states."

The coronavirus came to Ukraine, but authorities are hiding this information from citizens in order to avoid panic and the recurrence of “New Sanjar”. Two experts wrote about this in social networks at once - Mikhail Chaplyga and Yuri Tkachev.
At the same time, Chaplyga drew attention to the fact that recently in Ukraine the mortality from pneumonia, which, as you know, was the first to be affected by the “Wuhan plague”, has increased 4-6 times. Moreover, the political scientist notes, European neighbors want to close the borders with Ukraine, knowing that it is a hotbed of coronovirus: after all, Ukraine has not even entered the network of countries with official testing!
However, Mikhail Chaplyga believes that only tuberculosis, the epidemic of which swept Ukraine, is worse than the coronovirus - and from April 1 all tuberculosis dispensaries will be closed in the country, and carriers of Koch’s sticks will simply be thrown out into the street. “Also take an interest in tuberculosis ... You will mature and run away from the country even without belongings,” he assures.
“At the same time, medical officials cheerfully“ build for millions ”such as sterile boxes in old and virus-filled hospitals ... Stupidly making money from hysteria: they sell masks and other thermometers. They chop cabbage. And Zelensky knows about this - he is either afraid or in share. This is a very serious mafia, ”the political scientist said. This is confirmed by the fact that the Minister of Health Zoryana Skaletskaya will retain her post, although a ministerial shake-up will take place in the Cabinet on March 4, and a number of officials will lose their portfolios. But Zoryan Skaletskaya, who more than once confirmed the course towards the continuation of the medical reform named after Suprun, was forbidden to touch the external curators. The fact that they are trying to hide the presence of a coronavirus in the country was written in his TG channel by the editor of the Odessa Timer, Yuri Tkachev, after a conversation with a senior medical official.
“I ask him a question: but it will not be possible to hide the beginning of the coronavirus epidemic in the country? Even as possible, the interlocutor assured me. How exactly? Yes, like that, to say that there are no patients and that’s all.
But will the sick be? Will be. But how to prove that they are sick with coronavirus, and not, say, a severe form of influenza? Only with the help of special tests that you can’t buy at the pharmacy, and which only the authorities have. And the authorities will tell you what your test result is, and you have the coronavirus or just the flu.
But why hide it? I ask. And in order to avoid panic. Judge for yourself. Some 65,000 people got sick in Wuhan. The population of Wuhan is 11 million people. The population of Odessa is one million people. We divide 65,000 by 11 - we get somewhere around 6,000 potential patients in Odessa. In the boxes of the infectious diseases hospital - 60 beds. Well, you get it, right? And in order to mask their inability to restrain the spread of infection, they will pretend that it does not exist at all. Here everyone has, but we do not. Absolutely no. Maybe then, for the species, 1-2-10 patients will be shown, so as not to get too scorched, ”the journalist writes. And he himself admits that he does not believe in such conspiracy theories for one simple reason: with a Ukrainian mess to crank up such a hoax so that there are no leaks is unrealistic.
“But there is such a version. The criterion will be the appearance of tests for coronavirus in the regions, and eventually, in free sale. But - at least in the regions. If after some intelligible time they do not appear, then I will begin to suspect that there is something in this conspiracy thesis, ”adds the Timer editor. By the way, the other day, the Ministry of Health announced that Ukraine received 900 tests (for a 40 millionth country, for a minute) to determine the coronovirus.

https://bahnews.com/archives/2435,"The mystery of the 5-year-old coronavirus! .. An exciting report that throws oil on the fire of ""conspiracy theory""","The controversy over the origin of the new coronavirus (Corona) has not subsided since it broke out in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, killing thousands and wounding about a quarter of a million people around the world.
This controversy escalated, especially between the United States and China, to the highest levels, as US President Donald Trump described it as a Chinese virus, while Beijing suspected that he was an American.
Although scientists and specialists are now busy combating this deadly epidemic, regardless of its source, and some confirm that there are no indications of its creation and that it is a ""natural"" virus known ""lineage"", it was exposed to a mutation that turned it into a ""killer"" that has the ability to penetrate human cells, except A report published by the American journal, Nature, known for its sobriety, still threw more oil on ""conspiracy theory"" oil.
This report was published on November 12, 2015, and reported that US scientists have created in the laboratory a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats in connection with a virus that causes SARS, that is, acute respiratory syndrome.
The magazine showed about 5 years ago that scientists had examined a virus called ""SHC014"", which was found in horseshoe bats in China.
These scientists combined the surface protein of ""SHC014"" with the SARS virus, and came out with a new virus that provided the surface protein with a structure that helps it penetrate the cells of the human respiratory system. It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.
In this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans.
Researchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, ""may be more common than previously thought.""
On the other hand, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify ""potential risks"".
Simon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: ""If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.""
In October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on ""job promotion"", especially those that cause serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans.

While the headquarters of anti-Corona Virus operations in Russia announced today, Monday, that the Corona virus detection test was conducted on more than 165 thousand people, and more than 72 thousand people are still under medical supervision because of the suspected infection with the virus.
A representative of the Russian ""Azure-Air"" company announced that a special flight of the company took off to Morocco to evacuate Russian citizens from there in light of the spread of the ""Corona"" virus.
Vyacheslav Eileen, head of the department of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, believes that the SK virus is not excluded from falling into a meteorite on Chinese soil.

To date, 41 deaths have been reported by Friday and more than 1,300 people have been infected with the virus. The virus has also reached Europe and the United States, and has so far spread rapidly in China. Since 2017, it has been known that the Pentagon operates organic laboratories worldwide that are located on the borders of Russia, China and Iran.
Therefore, it can at least now not be ruled out that the United States released the virus on arch-enemy China in order to test its deadly virus on humans or even simply want to kill a large number of people. In the past few years, the United States has established itself as the number 1 mass murderer, which establishes entire terrorist militias such as Al Qaeda or IS across borders, before rushing to help as a rescuer from terrorism as a global police force.
In view of these connections, such a presumption of spreading deadly viruses in China and around the world is initially an ""abstruse conspiracy theory"" for the US-owned western press, but it is not far-fetched.
In 2018, it was revealed that the United States has a bio-weapons program in Georgia that is hermetically shielded from the outside world and not under the control of international organizations. There are also another dozen such laboratories in Ukraine, where biological weapons such as deadly viruses are tested on humans as if they were laboratory rats.
The 2019 nCoV virus targets the airways and causes cough, fever and difficulty breathing. Liquid can be drained from the lungs, the airways can be cleaned and dilated, and oxygen can be released through the mask. However, these are just ways to relieve the symptoms.
Antibiotics are useless against viruses - if you have a virus, the doctor tells you to rest a lot and gives you a lollipop. Antibiotics only help against Bak Against a virus, your body's immune system is your only line of defense. The only real protection against external viruses is vaccines, but their development can take a long time and are not always effective. When the virus mutates and the vaccine becomes unusable, it happens with influenza almost every winter when doctors play a guessing game about which strains of flu will spread this year.
Some have speculated that 2019-nCoV is actually a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that killed nearly 800 people across Asia in 2002. DNA analysis of 2019-nCoV showed that it is very similar to SARS - essentially a modified form. However, Chinese officials are trying to distance this new bug from SARS. Perhaps they fear that the name will panic the public. So far, the message ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" appeared to be in effect - commuters in Beijing were not overly concerned about 2019 nCoV, although five cases were confirmed there.
And of course there is a «conspiracy theory» on Wikipedia about the SARS epidemic in China that you shouldn't believe in. Not because the United States' biological weapons program could have anything to do with it. However, new insights into the United States' biological weapons program came to light about 15 years after the epidemic. In this respect, it is not far-fetched that Pentagon is testing its weapons on Chinese, of whom the US regime believes there are more than enough anyway. In response to questions about Ukraine, Pompeo yelled at a journalist"

Former Donald Trump adviser indicated that American billionaire Bill Gates might have done this so he could grow microchips in people's heads to distinguish who was tested for COVID-19 and not tested. Stone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM waves, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: ""Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate."" He added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to sow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations.
According to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is linked to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain ""mandatory vaccinations."" Stone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations. Gates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis such as coronaviruses, to the extent of recent talk about Gates's prediction of the disease 3 years ago. As the Washington Times reported, Gates announced earlier this month that his charitable organization would invest billions of dollars in factories that would focus on developing many vaccines.

https://asd.news/articles/ukraina/derzhatsya-netu-bolshe-sil/,Hold no more strength,"In Kiev, they live in anticipation of default: at the end, even cash
The Ukrainian authorities woke up and talked about the collapse. Surrounded by President Vladimir Zelensky, panic is not hidden. According to the deputy of the Verkhovna Rada from the party “Servant of the People”, Alexander Dubinsky, the country is about to default, as it is impossible to repay the amount of debts that Kiev has without global financial assistance.
According to the people's representative, Kiev has neither an economic strategy for the country's survival without the help of the International Monetary Fund, nor a plan for the existence of Ukraine in connection with the situation with coronavirus. “Are there conditions for Ukraine’s survival in the context of the global financial and economic crisis?” No. What are you talking about, what kind of masks ... Not a damn thing, there are no bugs, no food, no canned food. The state reserve is empty at all ... ”- Dubinsky panicked, recalling that Ukraine imports the vast majority of products. True, I was afraid to say that there was no longer a neighbor who always pulled out of the pit in the most difficult times. But only “feed wheat, the crop of which has not yet ripened,” is available.
As if in confirmation of Dubinsky's words, the National Bank Nezalezhnaya made a statement. There is an acute shortage of cash in the country, the regulator said. The population in droves rushed to buy green banknotes, not backed up by anything, except for the giant US public debt. “In recent days, we have seen signs of a shortage of cash at the banks’ cash desks. <...> Due to the cessation of air transportation and the closure of borders, cash dollars and euros are being delivered to Ukraine with a delay, ”the National Bank said in a statement, financiers who tried to calm the population calmly supposedly , $ 8 billion of non-cash currency is concentrated on correspondent accounts of banks in the country, and customers can freely convert and transfer money to their accounts in other banks. But such exhortations are useless when people try to ""correctly"" invest the rest of their savings.
However, Zelensky still hopes for a miracle, that the situation is normalizing. He took his hat and went with outstretched hand to the oligarchs, perhaps they would save. Another thing is that in return these gentlemen will ask a lot of things. But, as they say, after us at least a flood. To begin with, under the pretext of combating coronavirus, the guarantor persuaded Ukrainian businessmen to part with $ 500 million, since “it was time to help the country” after it “fed” the business for a long time. Money, of course, will go to a separate fund organized by the government. With the allocated funds Zelensky promised to buy medical equipment, protective and disinfectants. At the same time, it is noteworthy that there were no instructions from the NSDC, SBU, the State Security Service and the Prosecutor General’s Office to sort out and report which officials were involved in the illegal export of protective equipment, who failed the test systems support program, why the Ukrgosrezerv does not have the necessary supply of medical masks.
But the guarantor put everyone home. Most importantly, in order to avoid the Maidan, he transferred Kiev to a state of siege, so that the people would starve separately and not go out with forks against the authorities. Now citizens will not be able to get together more than 10 people. From tomorrow, passenger rail, bus and air transportation within the country will be stopped. Moreover, in Ukrainian cities the metro stops working. The rest of the city transport will continue to function, but with limitations. Transportation in minibuses, trolleybuses and buses can only be carried out if there are up to 20 people in the cabin.
By what miracle the Ukrainian authorities will be able to control this with an idle subway, etc., when crowds rush to besiege single buses, trolleybuses and trams - it is incomprehensible to the mind. They promise, of course, that police will follow the number of citizens. But where to get so many law enforcement officers? With them, as you know, the country is tense. Obviously the obstinate mayor of Kharkov, Gennady Kernes, did not understand everything. He has already refused to stop the subway, saying that he does not agree with the position of the president, he is against and is not going to close the metro.
To this, the guarantor hastened to transfer all responsibility for the distribution of the coronavirus to Kernes, saying that every patient in Kharkov is on the conscience of the mayor. And even threatened the bunks for disobedience. “I will say this very carefully: if he breaks the law, and he begins to do it, then he will personally face criminal liability,” promised Zelensky, who, in addition to punishing the Shrew, has a lot more to do, for example, checking the shelves. The people, although they are mostly impoverished, get their money for essential goods from somewhere, wonderfully replenish their stocks, and stores eventually become empty. Not an order. Yes, and the sale of Ukrainian land should be dealt with closely, while citizens can not participate in mass protests in view of the impending epidemic."

Vyacheslav Eileen, head of the department of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, believes that the SK virus is not excluded from falling into a meteorite on Chinese soil.
""Chandra Wikrasingh, the famous external biologist from Cardiff University in Wales, announced several days ago that he does not rule out that the Corona virus has fallen to the ground with the meteor that exploded over China in October 2019,"" Eileen told Russian news agency RIA Novosti.
""Is it possible? Yes, it is possible,"" the Russian expert said, responding to a question from the agency's correspondent. He added, explaining, to answer the question accurately, a study should be made of DNA synthesis of similar viruses during a long journey in space. Such an experiment is planned for 2023-2024 when the Bion-M No. 2 is launched.
This experiment involves the launching of a rocky ""meteorite"", on which the outer surface contains holes in which bacteria have high temperature resistant bacteria and some chemicals that can form the basis of the organic matter composition. The main goal of this experiment is to verify whether life on Earth has been brought from space.
""This is a very exciting experiment from the point of view of the ability to transfer biological materials, including nucleotide chains, which can be the basis for synthesis of anything similar to viruses,"" he says."

https://www.rt.com/usa/484111-nevada-doctors-unlicensed-chloroquine-ban/,Is there a doctor in the house? Nevada state medical team that banned malaria drug for coronavirus lacks qualification,"Trump’s detractors in the Nevada state health department have moved heaven and earth to stop doctors in the state from prescribing two drugs the president deemed promising for treatment of coronavirus, insisting he’s not qualified enough for his opinion to outweigh a lack of medical consensus. However, a few Twitter detectives discovered on Wednesday that these “professionals” don’t seem to have all the necessary licenses and qualifications to practice medicine in the US either.
At the urging of his state medical advisors, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak banned the use of FDA-approved malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat coronavirus in an emergency order issued on Tuesday.
The order tightly restricts supply of the drugs, limiting even non-coronavirus cases to a 30-day supply. Sisolak, a Democrat, explained it was a safety measure to prevent hoarding of the malaria medicines and ensure continued supply to the patients who desperately need them.
Pushing the loudest for the restrictions had been Ihsan Azzam, Nevada’s chief medical officer. While Azzam has a masters degree and prior experience in environmental public health and epidemiology, fulfilling the qualifications required to hold the state post, his only experience actually practicing medicine came from an obstetrics and gynecology department in an African hospital over two decades ago.
Turns out Nevada’s chief medical officer is not even licensed to practice medicine in the US. He had advised the governor to prohibit the use of hydroxychloroquine for Coronavirus treatment. ht @shiftyjoel https://t.co/z4etoJVJdS

Azzam is thus not qualified to actually practice medicine in the US, nor does he have any experience treating respiratory conditions, and his advice to Sisolak appeared to some to be motivated more by anti-Trump sentiment than genuine medical concern. It’s not clear how many malaria patients Nevada typically sees in a given year - the mosquito-borne illness is exceedingly rare in the US, and was even declared eliminated in 1951 by the Centers for Disease Control - but the decision to essentially put them ahead of potential coronavirus sufferers raised some eyebrows, especially among Trump supporters familiar with the president’s interest in the drugs.

Nor is it only Azzam potentially dispensing unqualified medical advice to Nevadans. Another researcher pointed out that both Nevada’s medical epidemiologist and state epidemiologist also seemed to lack the necessary qualifications to “make medical decisions related to infectious disease.” Medical epidemiologist Stephanie Woodward has a doctorate in psychology, not epidemiology or public health; while state epidemiologist Melissa Peek-Bullock has just a BS in health ecology. While her resume touts her leading roles managing various local disease outbreaks, she lacks even a Masters in Public Health and neither woman appears to have attended medical school.
Many on social media were shocked that there was not a single practicing medical doctor among the trio, and a petition to recall Sisolak as governor even began gathering momentum.

An exciting report that throws oil on fire, ""Conspiracy Theory""","The mystery of the coronavirus, which has slept 5 years!
world News
The controversy over the origin of the new coronavirus (Corona) has not subsided since it broke out in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, killing thousands and wounding about a quarter of a million people around the world.
This controversy escalated, especially between the United States and China, to the highest levels, as US President Donald Trump described it as a Chinese virus, while Beijing suspected that he was an American.
Although scientists and specialists are now busy combating this deadly epidemic, regardless of its source, and some confirm that there are no indications of its creation and that it is a ""natural"" virus known to ""lineage"", it was exposed to a mutation that turned it into a ""killer"" that has the ability to penetrate human cells, except A report published by the American journal, Nature, known for its sobriety, still threw more oil on ""conspiracy theory"" oil.
This report was published on November 12, 2015, and reported that US scientists have created in the laboratory a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats in connection with a virus that causes SARS, that is, acute respiratory syndrome.
The magazine revealed about 5 years ago that scientists had examined a virus called ""SHC014"", which was found in horseshoe bats in China.
These scientists combined the surface protein of ""SHC014"" with the SARS virus, and came out with a new virus that provided the surface protein with a structure that helps it penetrate into the cells of the human respiratory system. It was also proven that this virus causes rat disease, but it does not kill it.
In this regard, specialists talked before that in 2013 about their success in isolating a coronavirus that lives in bats with the ability to penetrate human cells. This happened despite stressing that not all coronavirus can infect humans.
Researchers have come to this worrying conclusion that coronaviruses in bats, which can infect humans directly without passing through the body of their host animal, ""may be more common than previously thought.""
In contrast, other scientists have warned that the information obtained from this laboratory experiment does not justify ""potential risks"".
Simon Wayne Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, commented on the news that scientists have invented a new virus that grows well in human cells, saying: ""If the virus leaks, no one can predict its course.""
In October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal funding for such research on viruses that focus specifically on ""job promotion"", especially those causing serious diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads sporadically from camels to humans.

https://hourpress.net/news-100922.htm,A famous Russian doctor explains the secret of immunity against corona,"Hourly News Date: 04-04-2020 | Since: 4 weeks ago
Elena Malysheva, the famous Russian presenter and presenter, enumerated some nutrients that can boost the body's immunity to fight the infection of the Coruna virus.
During one of her televised medical programs, Malysheva said: ""Food products that contain large amounts of zinc are necessary to activate the so-called killer cells in the body. These cells, according to doctor Andre Prodius, are tasked with killing other cells infected with the virus.""
The doctor indicated that a person can get this important component from different foods such as shellfish, oats and corn flakes.
According to Malysheva, the elderly with diabetes are among the most at risk of corona, due to the symptoms that may cause zinc deficiency in their bodies, which may affect the work of their immune system.
The doctor advised those suffering from cardiovascular diseases and cancer patients to add the Brazilian nuts to their diet as it contains selenium, which is considered an anti-oxidant and an important component to strengthen the immune system.
She also stressed the need to drink more water, especially for the elderly, and she explained that dehydration and lack of fluids helps increase the concentration of viruses and germs in the body.

https://www.kp.ru/daily/27084/4156757/,Even Stephen Hawking and Wang scared humanity with something like a coronavirus,"Even Stephen Hawking and Wang scared humanity with something like a coronavirus
Physics predictions…
The last 10 years of his life, the British physicist - Professor Stephen Hawking (Professor Stephen Hawking), speaking in front of an audience, must have expressed any concerns about the future of mankind. “Stephen Hawking’s fears” is the name given to them by journalists.
“Fears” was published the year before last — they were included in the book “Brief Answers to the Big Questions”. Or “Short answers to serious questions” in another translation.
The professor was afraid of many things: the visits of evil aliens, the fact that the Earth would overheat and become unsuitable for life, he was afraid of artificial intelligence that would enslave people. He was frightened by the prospect of the appearance of robotic soldiers deprived of any moral hesitation.
But most of all the scientist was afraid of nuclear and, most importantly, biological weapons. He predicted the appearance of genetically modified viruses. The scientist was not reassured by the assurances of colleagues, they say, all of ""biology"" - under control. He had no doubt that once some incredibly infectious and indestructible trifle, created artificially, would break out of the laboratory and go to “mow” people. Up to the last man.
This is how coronaviruses that attacked humanity look like.
Coronavirus 2019-nCoV - God forbid, if Stephen Hawking's fear was embodied in it. After all, suspicions of the artificial origin of this malignant trifle, causing unprecedented atypical pneumonia, look completely justified. The infection manifested itself in Wuhan, where in 2018 the Chinese authorities opened the Institute of Virology. Former Israeli intelligence officer Dani Shoham recently said that one of the institute’s laboratories participated in a secret Chinese biological weapons program.
It is completely possible that the new coronavirus was developed on the basis of the ""old"" one, which caused the outbreak of SARS in 2002-2003. According to scientists, the genomes of these viruses coincide by 80 percent.
And the most suspicious: emergency measures that the Chinese authorities took immediately after the first 2019-nCoV infected with this appeared. They looked redundant and did not at all correspond to the reassuring statements of physicians from different countries. Like, there’s nothing wrong and never will be. Now defensive measures are even more fearful, but seem appropriate.
There are suspicions that the current coronavirus appeared as a result of the creation of biological weapons.
It seems that the Chinese from the very beginning were aware of the danger threatening humanity. And they had reason to believe that the “lethal force” and virulence of the new coronavirus would increase as it spreads.
How can one not believe the rumors that the 2019-nCoV ""leaked"" from a secret laboratory? And not necessarily in the form of ready-to-use biological weapons. The new coronavirus, which has already killed more than a hundred people, could well be a prototype. Or even a semi-finished product, the antidote for which, apparently, has not yet been created. Otherwise, the Chinese would not cry out for help by sending counterparts from other countries with samples of the genome of this 2019-nCoV.
... and the lyrics
The prophecies of other recognized seers do not seem as obvious. Although quatrain 22 from the First Century of Nostradamus, which has come down to us from the Middle Ages, is quite suitable for the modern situation: ""Destruction and death saddles science, all life will lose both value and meaning.""
However, this phrase is suitable for much more.
Baba Wang seems to have foreseen the impending disaster. Back in the 70s of the last century, she predicted at the end of the first decade of this century an epidemic of a new viral disease that would spread rapidly around the world and take many lives. But she said that the epidemic would begin in China, pointed to Africa. She promised that it would take a whole year to create a vaccine against the new virus. This, surprisingly, is in good agreement with current medical forecasts.
Vanga made a mistake on the continent's prophecy. ""Saw"" the beginning of the epidemic in Africa.
It was as if billionaire Bill Gates and his wife Melinda knew about the prophecy of Wang. Recently, they (the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) have allocated $ 10 million to Africa specifically - to emergency funds for those who are trying to keep 2019-cNoV from spreading across the black continent.

Charles Lieber, a well-known Harvard biologist, has been arrested in the United States. In the press, he was exposed to the Chinese government in making coronavirus.
Liber really worked for 5 years in Ukhan. His annual salary was $ 200,000 plus 1 million grants.
This also became one of the excuses for the American scientist to be accused of being connected with Chinese intelligence. At the same time, Liber collaborated with the Pentagon.
A Harvard journalist writes that Liber was busy creating nanorobots the size of a virus, which should be able to control the cells of living organisms by bypassing the protective reactions of the whole organism.
Therefore, we can assume that in addition to the industry between America and China, the spy confrontation is also brewing.
. It is clear to everyone that China does not spare money to buy America's leading brains and to attract them to the world in favor of its interests. No one knows for sure whether the Liberals created the Coronavirus, but the Americans rightly believe that the Liberals could really sell the latest nanotechnologies to the Chinese - for example, even inventing how to force plants to luminescence at night instead of street lights.

Former Donald Trump adviser indicated that American billionaire Bill Gates might have done this so he could grow microchips in people's heads to distinguish who was tested for COVID-19 and not tested. Stone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM waves, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: “Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate,” according to Russia today, citing the New York Post.
Electronic chips
He added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to sow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations. According to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is related to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain ""mandatory vaccinations."" Stone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations."

Has the virus been transmitted to USS Roosevelt from an American military crew that it visited coming from another ship?
As of March 30, 2020, the number of US soldiers infected with the new Corona virus on board the giant USS Roosevelt aircraft carrier, 8 sailors, according to the official recognition of the US Navy, while the American network ABC reported 36 cases, Quoted from a military official, who declined to be identified. We are not talking here about a cruise ship with 200 passengers and the countries of the world refuse to receive it, but rather one of the largest pieces that humans have built with a length of 332 meters, carrying 3,200 naval soldiers and 2480 pilot soldiers. And most of all, it was until a few days that it moved from one port to another in the Gulf, where its personnel dock and exit to participate in many activities in the allied countries hosting joint programs. Just a few days ago, the US Navy decided to adjust the carrier's agenda and itinerary to head to Guam Island, the strategic location of US forces, with the aim of conducting checks for its crew. The reported cases of injuries among soldiers do not include an unspecified number of quarantined people on board the carrier, knowing that sterilization on a ship of this size is complex. More importantly, stopping the spread of the virus requires its evacuation completely, with only 800 devices available for corona testing in the carrier's medical team. But the most important for the countries in which it was docked is the identification of the persons who communicated with its crew, as well as the determination of the ""zero"", a measure that is almost impossible due to the secrecy surrounding the medical examinations that the sailors will be subjected to, according to the protocol in force in the US Navy. The USS Roosevelt carrier claims that it headed to the Indian-Pacific shared area on January 17, 2020, on a mission that was supposed to last 7 months, first dressed in the port of Da Nang in Vietnam, where New cases of coronavirus infection are currently being discovered (in the port itself and the town in which it is located), knowing that Vietnam was completely empty, and for 22 days, from any local infection, until multiple infections appeared through British tourists in the same town where they docked. USS Roosevelt ""for two weeks. The “mystery” of the spread of the epidemic on the carrier in light of the great American discretion cannot be answered, especially since the number of injuries may rise dramatically due to the ventilation mechanism on the carrier and the narrow living spaces allocated to the sailors, with an excess of the number of surfaces, such as stairs, door handles and narrow paths Between the rooms, and the presence of shared bathrooms, note that the sailors spend a large part of their time examining all parts of the carrier, with a view to ensuring their availability throughout. The Americans insist on talking about the appearance of corona symptoms between soldiers 15 days after visiting Vietnam, while the poor country, Southeast Asia, did not witness any case of corona before visiting the US aircraft carrier, so did the virus pass to ""USS Roosevelt"" from a crew An American soldier visited from another ship? This is the most likely answer, especially since time did not help the carrier to move to other ports, and the only friction he experienced was her sailors, who was in the high ocean during joint exercises with other American parts."
https://annabaa.org/arabic/health/22748,How to strengthen your immunity during the Corona virus pandemic?,"The spread of the Corona virus caused panic in many countries of the world, and precautionary measures were taken, including attention to raising the immune system, which plays a major role in protecting the body from viruses.
Doctors and researchers are still betting on the ability of the human body to deal with the deadly disease, through the human autoimmune system, in light of the delay in the emergence of a successful treatment or a vaccine against the emerging corona virus, the current viral pandemic is mysterious. Many questions go through the minds of many, such as did you catch the virus? Do I have it now? Did I have immunity to it? Was your cough a few weeks ago a mild infection with the virus or for some other reason? I felt sick, but your temperature did not rise and improved, so do you still have to stay at home?
If you suffer from symptoms and you are lucky, a smear will be taken from you to determine whether you have the virus or not, and it may mean that your body produced while you are at home antibodies fighting the virus. If you haven't had a test during your illness and recovered - which is the case for many people, your condition remains unknown because you do not know if you are infected with the virus and may spread it among others. That is why a group of researchers has decided to develop a blood test that reveals the formation of immunity in your body against the virus, according to a Reuters report.
To overcome the Corona crisis physically and mentally, one needs strong and robust immunity. To fulfill this requirement, you must do things that will ultimately bring you happiness and strengthen your body's immunity at a time when we need strong immunity, more than ever.
The majority of us are in this exceptional situation for the first time due to a virus. And a lot of things seem to be getting out of control. Some habits break up, and no one knows how the situation will last. Thus, the things that we control with our hands seem important to maintain health and strength. The main condition for this is to reduce and strengthen the burden on our immune system, through things that we mention here: healthy eating In fact, it is always important to support the body and the soul with healthy nutrition as possible. And now it is precisely our diet that is important. Healthy eating reduces, as is proven, the risk of chronic diseases such as diseases of the circulatory system, heart, diabetes and obesity, and it also reduces the possibility of depression and a feeling of fear. The best nutrients for our psyche are those that are also healthy for our body. Our brain especially benefits from carbohydrates, as it is available in fruits, vegetables and barley. Energy is slowly excreted from these nutrients. This has a positive impact on our psychological state. The food that strengthens our immune system includes nutrients with a high content of vitamins, especially A and B, in addition to mineral substances such as iron and zinc. B vitamins are abundant in vegetables, eggs, chicken and fish. B vitamins are important for our brain to secrete hormones of happiness. Depression is often caused by a deficiency of B6, B12 and folic acid.
And even the position of the intestine has a strong impact on our psychological feeling and the comfort of our body. Fermentary foodstuffs, such as yoghurt or curd ""yogurt"", have an anti-inflammatory effect and can thus improve our emotional well-being.
Even the World Health Organization has released a list of advice that helps maintain good physical and mental health. She also talked about what we should give up like consuming tobacco, alcohol or other drugs.
Comfortable sleep, and while we are sleeping, our body continues to work, as the cells regenerate and toxic substances break down and the information is processed and our memory is strengthened. Research has revealed that a lack of sleep has broad implications for our health and negative for our sensory condition and for our emotional intelligence. The lack of sleep also makes us vulnerable to chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease.
And as we follow some habits of eating, working and sports, an equal sleep system is very important. For most people, six to nine hours of sleep is sufficient. Going to bed at the same time and waking up may contribute to maintaining a degree of habit.
And if you are having trouble sleeping, try before going to bed not to see the news even in the time of Corona, and avoid looking at the computer screen, because the blue light for the screens reduces the quality of sleep. What if I hold a book?
Rise, movement immerses our body in happiness hormones, it contributes to improving sleep, reduces stress and fear, and also strengthens our memories and perceptions. Movement and exercise can be done indoors, and specialists recommend 30 minutes per day, either at once or intermittently. The main thing is to get some movement. Fitness trainers now offer online lessons, sometimes for free.
There are multiple possibilities to make sports moves, even in the balcony or on the ladder at home. Touring outdoors is also important for health. Since direct communication has diminished these days because of Corona, communication via social media has acquired a great importance and has a positive impact, and since you now have enough time because of your staying at home in the time of Corona, then think about completing those things that you have never had time To accomplish it, such as working in the garden or cooking, then all you have to do in sanitary days is to take advantage of your own energies, which always helped you overcome difficult times.
How does immunity inside the body fight the Corona virus?
An Australian study found the way the immune system works against corona, as it is able to eliminate the virus in the same way that it works to repel the regular flu. Corona Anti Virus.
The researchers discovered the cells by treating a patient who came from Wuhan, China to Australia, and was infected with the virus with a mild to moderate infection. The researchers observed the emergence of certain immune cells in their blood three days before they recovered, and the study found that this type of cell appears Also in people with influenza and at the same stage of the disease, which confirms that those with Corona virus, who do not have severe symptoms, are recovering in the same way as those with normal flu.
According to experts, discovering the type of immune cells that appear after infection with the Coronavirus, may help in developing a vaccine against it, and in identifying the stages of the virus's development, a discovery that experts described as a real scientific breakthrough.
The largest drug companies around the world are racing to make a drug capable of conquering the Corona virus, which has killed about 9,000 people and infected more than 220,000 in more than 120 countries. About 50 drugs are being developed and tested to counter the virus, also known as ""Covid 19"", According to the World Health Organization, it has not yet approved any proven treatment for the virus, and there is no vaccine to prevent it.
The secret of immunity against corona
Elena Malysheva, the famous Russian doctor and presenter, enumerated some nutrients that are able to boost the body's immunity to fight against the infection of the Corona virus, and during one of its televised medical programs, Malysheva said: ""Food products that contain large amounts of zinc are necessary to activate the so-called killer cells in the body, These cells, according to doctor Andreas Prodius, have the mission to kill other cells infected with the virus. ""
The doctor indicated that a person can get this important component from various foods such as oysters, oats and corn flakes, and according to Malysheva, the elderly with diabetes are among the most at risk of corona, due to the symptoms that may cause zinc deficiency in their bodies, which may affect Their immune system work.
The doctor advised those suffering from cardiovascular diseases and cancer patients to add the Brazilian nuts to their diet as it contains selenium, which is considered an anti-oxidant and an important component to strengthen the immune system, and also stressed the need to increase drinking water, especially for the elderly, and she explained that dehydration and fluid deficiency helps to Increased concentration of viruses and germs in the body.
The treatment is inside you
With the delay in the emergence of a successful treatment or preventive vaccine against the emerging corona virus, doctors and researchers are still betting on the ability of the human body to deal with the deadly disease, through the human immune system.
An Australian study found the way the immune system works against corona, and concluded that the device is able to eliminate the virus in the same way as it works to repel the regular flu. On fighting against the SK virus.
The researchers reached the discovery of the cells by treating a patient who came from Wuhan, China to Australia, and was infected with the virus with a mild to moderate infection. The researchers observed the emergence of certain immune cells in their blood three days before they recovered, and the study found that this type of cell also appears In people with influenza and at the same stage of illness, which confirms that those with coronavirus, who do not have severe symptoms, are recovering in the same way as those with normal flu.
According to experts, discovering the type of immune cells that appear after infection with the Coronavirus, may help in developing a vaccine against it, and in identifying the stages of the virus's development, a discovery that experts described as a real scientific breakthrough.
The largest drug companies around the world are racing to make a drug that can defeat the Corona virus, which has killed about 9,000 people and infected more than 220,000 in more than 120 countries. About 50 drugs are being developed and tested to counter the virus, also known as ""Covid 19"", The World Health Organization says it has not yet approved any proven treatment for the virus, and there is no vaccine to prevent it.
Lifestyle enhances the immune system against corona
1- Fresh lemon every morning
Drinking a cup of lemon juice diluted with pure water every morning seems an ideal way to start digestion and boost immunity, because it contains vital ""flavonoids"", which are one of the antioxidant compounds that protect the body from pollutants and toxins, and contribute to strengthening immunity.
On the other hand, drinking a cup of fresh lemon juice in the morning 15 minutes before breakfast, has been shown to help restore the acid-base balance in the body and maintain its internal balance at the pH level, which supports healthy bacteria instead of harmful viruses and bacteria that reproduce. In more acidic media.
2- Alkali medium
The immune system is at its best when it is in an alkaline medium, and recent studies indicate that the acid medium is a fertile environment for a number of bacteria and viruses, but the latter cannot adapt to a healthy alkaline environment. In this regard, the researchers recommend eating leafy vegetables and drinking large quantities of water to support the alkalinity of the body and its immunity.
3- Yogurt daily
Eating a cup of bio-yogurt helps prevent infection, because it contains ""probiotics"", the latter being a useful bacterium that stimulates immune cells in the digestive tract, and also helps stimulate the production of immune cells. A study issued by the University of ""Vienna"" in this regard, which dealt with 33 women, revealed that those who consumed a cup of yogurt daily and for two weeks increased the number of lymphocytes that boost immunity by nearly 30%.
4- The power of raw food
Nutritionists advise eating green vegetables and fresh citrus fruits in snacks, while cooking other foods (eggs, meat and fish) at a low temperature and for a longer period of time, inside pots that are not made from ""aluminum"", because this substance increases the burden of toxins on the immune system.
5- Eat garlic
Garlic has immune-enhancing properties because it contains compounds such as ""allicin"" and ""sulfide"" that give it a pungent taste. It is one of the antioxidants that hinders the growth of free radicals in the bloodstream, plays a role in getting rid of other carcinogenic and toxic substances, and prevents the adhesion of blood platelets to each other.
6- Good sleep
Studies issued by the American Society of Cardiology show that ""good sleep is linked to the balance of hormone levels, it boosts immunity, maintains the ideal weight, improves mood, and makes the skin more vibrant and healthy ..."".
On the other hand, new research dealing with sleep patterns proves that sleeping for only five hours per day increases the risk of dying from heart disease, and the lack of its hours is related to the increased risks of weight gain, diabetes and infectious diseases.
7- Moderation in exercise
As is the case in the diet, moderation is the basic rule, knowing that excessive sports training to the point of exhaustion may increase the secretion of ""adrenaline"" and ""cortisol"", which are two hormones that temporarily suppress the effectiveness of immunity.
Foods you should avoid at this time
Doctors and specialists emphasize a list of foods that may weaken the immune system, making it an easy prey for invading the Corona virus, while these specialists emphasize that there are foods that contribute to the transmission of the virus, and doctors stress - according to the ""Al-Hurra"" site and the ""Weiss Americans"" site - the need to have a strong immunity to counter Corona is advised to avoid certain foods and drinks that may weaken the immune system as a result of eating it continuously.
Here is a list of foods and drinks that the doctor at the American Piedmont Hospital, Samer Blackmon, believes that weakens the human immune system.
Soda
Soft drinks, which consist of industrial materials such as preservatives, gases, and flavors.
Processed foods
Such as white bread, sweetened breakfast cereals, pastries, biscuits, cakes, and fried food such as French fries or potato chips, ice cream, and processed meats.
Sugar-rich foods and foods
Dessert, ice cream, ketchup, white bread, juices, jam, spaghetti sauce, cakes, energy drinks, chocolate milk, garnula, flavored coffee, canned fruit
Treated carbohydrates
Like pizza, white rice, desserts, breakfast cereals, corn flakes, baked cakes and cakes, and French fries.
Alcoholic beverages and cigarettes
Although cigarettes are not food, they weaken the immune system and make them susceptible to disease. On the other hand, Doctor Blackmon said, ""Eating an integrated diet full of vegetables and fruits will give your body the vitamins and minerals it needs to fight diseases.""
The doctor added, ""These foods modify and adjust the body to function at maximum performance. Believe it or not, what you put in your mouth represents one brick to build a strong immune system.""
Does prepared food in restaurants transmit the Corona virus?
On the other hand, specialists and medical experts warned - according to the US ""Weiss"" site - that the Corona virus can be transmitted to humans through prepared foods, especially cold meats, vegetables and fruits.
And several researches have proven that the emerging virus lives on surfaces such as plastics and minerals for hours and days, but a new study has shown that foods can also be vectors of the virus, especially humid.
""Wet and semi-solid foods are a very appropriate medium for the virus, such as the mouth, and prolong the life of it,"" said Dr. Jacques Caravanos of the New York University Department of Public Health, and according to published reports, several Arab countries have begun distributing instructions to their citizens to avoid disease, including urging them To avoid eating ready-made meals, especially falafel, which is the most popular food in the region, especially Egypt. Caravanos says that foods such as cold meats, vegetables and meals exposed to air are “more vulnerable to contamination with the virus, as it can live in it for about five days.”
What is ""herd immunity""? Is it enough to counter the Corona virus?
The concept of “herd immunity” topped the front again after Britain announced its strategy to counter the outbreak of the new Corona virus in the country, which seemed to aim to push the British to acquire mass immunity against the virus.
And British Prime Minister Burs Johnson announced last week that the government would seek to slow the spread of the virus that causes the disease, rather than stopping it, as part of a mitigation strategy, which assumes that up to 80 percent of people will become infected before becoming vaccinated against the virus in the future. .
However, the British government backed away from that, after scientists warned that this approach could sink the country's health system, as happened in Italy, which could lead to the death of 250 thousand people.
How to gain herd immunity ?, according to a report by the South Tina Morning, Azra Ghani, an infectious disease expert at Imperial College London, whose research helped enrich government policy: “We expected to build the herd’s immunity. We now realize that it is not possible to deal However, after recovering from an infectious disease, the body's immune system often ""remembers"" the virus, so it can fight it in the future. Vaccines work on the same principle, by inserting molecules of bacteria or a virus into our bodies, leaving our immune system a memory of disease, without actually getting sick. Herd immunity describes the point where a sufficient number of people are immune to disease, whether through Vaccination or infection.
Although scientists continue to study the current virus, it is not considered infectious with the same proportion of measles, for example, as experts estimate that about 60-70 percent of the population will need to be infected in order to develop immunity to stop its spread.
Would it be the answer to Corona ?, and many experts believe that most people around the world will eventually become infected with the virus, unless a vaccine is first developed, a process that is expected to take at least 12-18 months. At this point, herd immunity will be a possible positive side effect, although millions will die to achieve this, and although scientists have provided estimates of infection rates, which will be necessary to achieve herd immunity, we do not know whether this The virus will go the same way as other viruses, and Jeremy Rossman, a senior honorary lecturer in virology at Kent University, said, “It is not certain that herd immunity is possible in the case of the Corona virus.” And he added, “Another possibility, is the evolution of the virus, Viruses tend to evolve, which causes us to start again, ""and there Fears that the virus will return more fierce next year, as happened with the Spanish influenza pandemic, which disappeared in the summer months to return in the fall and winter and kills more than before."
https://mediaelbalad.com/arab-and-world/187010,Accusations of Bill Gates .. Was behind the origins and spread of the Coronavirus?,"Roger Stone suggested on Monday that Bill Gates might have had a hand in creating the Corona virus and spreading the pandemic throughout the world.
Former Donald Trump adviser indicated that American billionaire Bill Gates might have done this so he could grow microchips in people's heads to distinguish who was tested for COVID-19 and not tested.
Stone spoke to Joe Pescopo, presenter of the radio show The Answer on 970 AM, who asked about conspiracy theories regarding the epidemic: “Whether Bill Gates has played a role in the creation and spread of this virus, this is open to serious debate.”
He added that Gates and other scientists are using the epidemic as a way to sow microchips in people and impose mandatory vaccinations.
According to Stone, this theory of Gates' role in the epidemic is related to his alleged plan to grow electronic chips in people that contain ""mandatory vaccinations.""
Stone, who was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment for his actions during the 2016 Trump campaign, strongly opposed the possibility of mandatory vaccinations.
Gates has long been an outspoken advocate of preparing for a global health crisis such as coronaviruses, to the point of recent talk about Gates' prediction of the disease 3 years ago.
The Washington Times also reported that Gates announced earlier this month that his charitable organization would invest billions of dollars in factories that would focus on developing many vaccines.

https://tsargrad.tv/news/koronavirus-sozdali-v-ssha-jekspert-romanoff-nazval-mesto-laboratorii_243097,Coronavirus created in the USA. Expert Romanoff named laboratory location,"Coronavirus created in the USA. Expert Romanoff named laboratory location
Global Research Canada columnist Larry Romanoff is convinced that the coronavirus was created in the United States. The expert even named the location of the biological weapons laboratory.
According to the journalist, the virus certainly did not appear on the seafood market in Chinese Wuhan - most likely, it was brought there from the outside.
""The only possible source of coronavirus origin is the United States, because only this country has all the branches of the evolutionary tree of coronaviruses. The original source of the COVID-19 virus was the US military laboratory in Fort Detrick,"" Romanoff quoted URA.RU.
The expert’s findings are based on studies by Japanese and Taiwanese epidemiologists.
So, he recalled that in August last year in the United States there was a wave of pneumonia, the source of which the Americans called vapes. Several cases of illness have been fatal.
Then a doctor from Taiwan warned the United States that the cause of pneumonia could be a coronavirus, but no one listened.
In addition, Romanoff notes that just before the outbreak in the United States, for some reason, they closed their main military biolaboratory in Fort Detrick.
Earlier, other experts also reported that coronavirus was created in the laboratory and specially distributed in China. According to economist Sergei Glazyev, a pandemic is part of the hybrid war being waged by the United States.
On the air of the Tsargrad. Main program, an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences shared his arguments with the presenter Yuri Pronko. In his opinion, it is enough to take separately each chain of events taking place now to understand the main thing - everything is man-made, starting with the coronavirus.

https://zvezdaweekly.ru/news/t/20201291341-AfM0x.html,Coronavirus: US biological warfare against Russia and China,"Coronavirus: US biological warfare against Russia and China
Prior to the advent of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, it was believed that the so-called “first package” of the US-China trade agreement, which was signed on behalf of the Celestial Empire by Vice Premier of the State Council of the PRC Liu He, is a tactical move, thanks to which China will get a respite. And then there is the presidential election in the USA, and it is still unknown whether Donald Trump will be able to gain a foothold in the Oval Office for a second term ... But, it seems, a malicious virus that has matured either in the stomachs of bats, or in a snake's gut, has confused all the cards to a friend Xi Jinping.
Against the backdrop of alarming reports from the Chinese province of Hubei (when this material was being prepared, more than 4.5 thousand people fell ill with pneumonia, and 106 died, and these are not final numbers. - Auth.) Copper and iron ore prices collapsed.
Copper is getting cheaper for ten days in a row, and yesterday the price fell by 1.5% to $ 5,834.5 per ton. Iron ore futures are falling in price, on Tuesday at the Singapore auction they offered 85 dollars per ton - a decrease of 6.4%. But, as Bloomberg predicts, $ 80 per tonne is not such a distant prospect. Prices for black gold also plummeted - April futures for the North Sea Brent crude mixture were already trading below $ 58 per barrel.
At the same time, the Fitch rating agency cautiously reports that the spread of coronavirus will first of all have a negative impact on the economies of Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore, since in these countries the most vulnerable regions to the epidemics are tourism and the service sector. The statement is indisputable - everyone will get it, and yet China, presumably, is more than the others, since it is the Chinese economy that is the main consumer of both metals and energy, and tourism with a service sector is not the last source of replenishment of the treasury. And since the prices of these goods went down, the Chinese economy also caught the “virus”. And it is easier to negotiate with a ""sick"" client, which is well known even without Trump.
It is noteworthy that 2019-nCoV got to the American technological giant Apple, whose production facilities are located just 500 kilometers from the “homeland” of the coronavirus - the Wuhan metropolis. And now, according to the Nikkei Asian Review, the production of popular iPhone smartphones is in jeopardy. Starbucks also found itself in a difficult situation, which, due to quarantine, had to close a large half of its four thousand coffee houses operating in China (by the way, this is the second largest market after the United States). But at the same time, the Americans for some reason do not look like such victims of the epidemic, especially Apple, whose leadership at the very beginning of the trade and economic confrontation with China advised to evacuate production facilities in the United States.
... It seems as if President Trump saw everything in advance, like Wolf Messing or old Wang. However, both Apple and Starbucks were really out of luck. You can’t say the same about the American political establishment, which is making titanic efforts to bring to its knees the ""presumptuous China."" And why should these efforts necessarily be of an economic nature? ..
The main question is - who benefits from another SARS unsettling a competitor? If we apply the well-known trick highly likely, unceremoniously used by the British ex-prime minister Theresa May to hang the so-called Skripals poisoning in Russia, the answer is obvious: the coronavirus epidemic 2019-nCoV, which hit China, is highly likely to be in the hands of the United States. And the worse for Beijing, the better for Washington. Moreover, the outlook for the epidemic is not yet encouraging. For example, some experts argue that if the spread of 2019-nCoV cannot be stopped, up to 250 million Chinese can become victims of the virus, which is almost two in number in Russia.
By the way, about the prospects. The Cepi Global Vaccine Coalition has reportedly invested a total of $ 12.5 million in three projects, in which researchers are ready to expeditiously develop the 2019-nCoV vaccine.
Scientists from the University of Queensland, as well as two American biotechnology companies Inovio and Moderna, participate in the work. The American National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is also involved. And it seems that microbiologists from Hong Kong have already developed a vaccine against the new coronavirus, as Professor of Hong Kong University Ewan Kwok-Jung hastened to inform the newspaper South China Morning Post. But her research, he claims, could take more than a year. German Shipulin, the deputy director of the Center for Strategic Planning of the Ministry of Health of Russia, does not promise an imminent victory over 2019-nCoV. So the hands of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV can be considered as yet untied, and there are suspicions that the United States may be involved in this epidemic. In the Russian media, this assumption has already been made.
US operations as part of a biological warfare against the entire planet
As a result of the dengue epidemic in Cuba from 1978-1981, up to 500 thousand people were affected. Fidel Castro said this was the result of an American biological attack. Washington did not confirm or refute the allegations of the Cuban leader.
Pentagon bio laboratories exist in 25 countries around the world. They are funded by the Military Threat Reduction Agency under a $ 2.1 billion military program. The joint biological cooperation program includes laboratories located in the countries of the former Soviet Union, such as Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, as well as in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
By the location of these biological laboratories, we can confidently indicate the four countries and territories against which the American biological threats are now directed, these are Russia, Iran, China and the countries of Central and West Africa. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
The American company CH2M Hill under the contracts for the Pentagon bio-laboratories in Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan, Southeast Asia was funded in the amount of $ 341.5 million. Of this amount, almost half ($ 161.1 million) was allocated for research in Lugar Center in Tbilisi. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
Its subcontractor, a private company, Battelle, has worked in Pentagon bio labs in Afghanistan, Armenia, Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. Battelle conducts research, development, testing and assessment of the use of both highly toxic chemicals and highly pathogenic biological agents for a wide range of US government agencies. The company has entered into federal contracts totaling $ 2 billion and ranks 23rd in the list of 100 best US state contractors. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
The Pentagon has a very long history of using insects as carriers of disease. According to a partially declassified US Army report of 1981, American scientists conducted a series of experiments on insects. These operations were part of the US Entomological War as part of a biological weapons program. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
The report reported two scenarios: 16 simultaneous attacks on the city by A. Aegypti mosquitoes infected with yellow fever, as well as Tularemia aerosol attack, and assessed their effectiveness in cash and loss of life. The results were very cynical. Pentagon experts managed to “kill” 625 thousand people at a cost of $ 0.29 per unit. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
Operation Big Itch: Field trials were conducted to determine the coverage and survivability of tropical rat fleas Xenopsylla cheopis for use as a disease carrier in biological warfare. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
Operation Big Buzz: 1 million A. Aegypti mosquitoes were raised. One third of them were placed in ammunition, dropped from aircraft and scattered on the ground. Mosquitoes survived in the air and actively sought human blood. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
Operations on military experiments with tropical mosquitoes and ticks in Georgia. Such species of mosquitoes and fleas (which were studied in the past as part of the US Entomological War Program) were imported into Georgia and tested at the Lugar Center. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
Anthrax is one of the biological agents in the arsenal of the US Army, not only in the past. Despite Pentagon claims that this program is only defensive, there are facts to the contrary. In 2016, at the Lugar Center, American scientists conducted a study called “Genome Sequence of the Soviet / Russian Bacillus anthracis Vaccine Strain 55-VNIIVViM” (Genome Sequence of the Soviet / Russian Anthracite Cancer Vaccine in Russia), which was funded by the US Agency’s Biological Weapons Sharing Program Threat Reduction (DTRA) in Tbilisi, and implemented by Metabiota. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by the tick-borne virus Nairovirus (Nairovirus). The disease was first described in Crimea in 1944 and was called Crimean hemorrhagic fever. Later, it caused an epidemic in the Congo in 1969. In 2014, 34 people were infected with the CCHF, including a 4-year-old child, three of whom died. Pentagon biologists are currently studying the virus in Georgia as part of the DTRA project, Epidemiology of febrile illnesses caused by Dengue viruses and other Arboviruses in Georgia. The project included trials on patients with fever symptoms and collection of ticks as possible distributors of CCHV for laboratory analysis. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
Similar CCHV outbreaks occurred in Afghanistan, where 3 Pentagon bio-laboratories are present. As of December 2017, 237 cases of CCHV were reported in this country, 41 of which were fatal. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
Bats are also being investigated as a carrier of various diseases at the Lugar Center, which scientists say are carriers of the Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and other deadly diseases. As of June 2017, 1980 cases were recorded with 699 deaths in 19 countries around the world caused by MERS-CoV. This virus is designed and manufactured in the USA. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
Another weapon of bioterrorism is, according to a 1981 US Army report, Tularemia developed in the USA, or Rabbit Fever. New tularemia carriers, such as ticks and rodents, are currently being developed. DTRA has launched a number of projects on Tularemia and in Georgia at the Lugar Center. Highly pathogenic agents (EDP) can be used for military purposes. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
Ukraine itself does not have control over military biological laboratories on its territory. Under the 2005 Agreement between the US Department of Defense and the Department of Health of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government is prohibited from publicly disclosing confidential information about the US program. Ukraine is also required to transfer all dangerous pathogens to the US Department of Defense for biological research. Under this Agreement, the Pentagon was granted access to many state secrets of Ukraine. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
The Pentagon has invested at least $ 65 million in gene editing research. The U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has provided seven research teams to develop tools for altering the genome of insects, rodents, and bacteria through the DARPA Safe Gene program using new CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
The worst biological weapon that may have already been used and possibly used in Russia is, again, perhaps used against the “enemy” of the USA - China. Until recently, ethnic biological weapons (biogenetic weapons) were theoretical weapons, the purpose of which is, first of all, to harm people of certain ethnic groups or genotypes (Russians, Chinese, etc.). Although officially the research and development of ethnic bio-weapons has never been publicly confirmed, documents show that the United States collects biological materials from certain ethnic groups - Russians and Chinese. American National Socialism in its purest form.
US Air Force specifically collects samples of Russian DNA and synovial tissue, which causes concern in Moscow about a hidden American program for the use of biological weapons.
Senator Franz Klintsevich commented on the words of President Vladimir Putin about the purposeful collection of Russian biomaterial: “In the West, everything is done very scrupulously and verified to the smallest detail: if we use biological weapons, then surely ... The relevant services in the West should know that we are aware of their interest. Let those who are engaged in this work on the territory of the Russian Federation not be offended. ”
And it cannot be said that such suspicions have no reason. As you know, the United States ratified the Geneva Protocol and the Biological Weapons Convention back in 1975. But biological games overseas have not stopped, and not only in the national territory. Already after the collapse of the USSR, American biological laboratories appeared, which is precisely established in Georgia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Where else - except that the State Department knows that it claims to be absolutely peaceful organizations involved in the development of medicines. But if they are so peaceful, then why, one wonders, did the Americans build them not at home, but at the other end of the world?
And the participants of the “visiting” American biological project are very specialized. For example, the US Army Institute of Infectious Disease Medical Research (USAMRIID, Fort Detrick), the Military Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), which is a division of the Pentagon, the Central Asian and Caucasian Biosafety Association, which monitors the biological potential of the CIS countries, the Biological Threat Reduction Program (Nunn-Lugar program) and so on.
Comments, as they say, are unnecessary. Not so long ago, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation analyzed documents on the activities of the so-called ""health center"" that the Americans built in Georgia, and came to the conclusion: in fact, this is a ""death factory"", which killed 73 people who were used by overseas biologists as experimental rabbits. But the fact of the matter is that American bio-laboratories are scattered not only around Russia, but also around the world, where America has its own interests.
And another question, where did the 2019-nCoV coronavirus originate - in a bat or in some American ""health center""? Where is it more highly likely?"
