Doctors have been told to avoid meeting patients with symptoms such as a fever or respiratory infection under guidance drawn up by Scottish health officials, to prevent an outbreak of coronavirus.
Health Protection Scotland issued updated advice on Thursday amid concern that the virus, covid-19, is likely to surface in the UK.
An 80-year-old Chinese man who died in a French hospital was confirmed yesterday as the first casualty of the epidemic outside Asia.
The Scottish guidance states that GPs must avoid contact with any patient who phones in with symptoms including fever or respiratory infection. “Clinical and travel history should be obtained and triage completed by telephone wherever possible. Contact with the patient should be avoided: this includes avoidance of face-to-face consultation and examination,”"
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52103799,Coronavirus : Fighting al - Shabab propaganda in Somalia,"Coronavirus: Fighting al-Shabab propaganda in Somalia
Muslim clerics in conflict-hit Somalia are moving to the front-line of the battle against coronavirus in a bid to counter the propaganda of militant Islamists, writes BBC Somalia analyst Mary Harper.
The al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab group has warned Muslims to beware of infectious diseases such as coronavirus, which it says are spread ""by the crusader forces who have invaded the country and the disbelieving countries that support them"".
The militants control much of southern and central Somalia and have been a powerful force for well over a decade.
Although there have only been a handful of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Somalia so far, the authorities are deeply worried that if the disease takes hold they will be unable to cope.
Koranic schools shut
About 30 years of conflict have devastated health facilities. Hundreds of thousands of displaced people are crowded into camps, with limited access to soap and water, and no way of practising social distancing.
The message from al-Shabab only adds to the government's concerns, especially as it could oppose medical help from international aid agencies just as it resisted most food aid during the 2010-2012 famine, when more than 250,000 people were estimated to have died.
12.3 millionpopulation
6.3 millionat risk of hunger
3.1 millionneed health assistance
2.7 millionneed water and sanitation support
2.6 millionhomeless because of instability
Somalia's mainstream Muslim clerics have now decided to fight back.
Koranic schools - known as madrassas, which nearly every child in Somalia attends - have been closed to help stop the spread of the virus.
The ministries of religious affairs, health and information have been working with Muslim leaders to transform teachers and mosque Imams into what has been dubbed as an ""anti-corona army"".
""They will stand with loudspeakers at every crossroads, every gathering place, to spread the word on how to prevent the spread of Covid-19,"" says Koshin Abdi Hashi, deputy co-ordinator for the prevention and countering of violent extremism in the office of the prime minister.
""They will drive around in vehicles mounted with loudspeakers, and transmit messages from the minarets of mosques,"" he adds.
Mohamed Ali Ibrahim, a university professor and senior adviser in the ministry of religious affairs, says the messages will include religious elements.
""We will talk about hand-washing and social distancing, but also speak of how Islam encourages cleanliness, including ablutions before prayers, and how there were dangerous diseases at the time of the Prophet Muhammad.""
Islamic teachings on hygiene:
- Cleanliness is half of faith
- Wash hands before and after eating
- Wash hands after going to the toilet
- Wash hands, face and feet before each of the five daily prayers
- Bathe before main weekly prayer on Fridays
- Wash a person after death; some clerics say it is fine if this cannot be done in current circumstances
The ""anti-corona army"" will monitor people, making sure they wash their hands thoroughly and regularly with soap and water, and maintain a safe distance from one another.
Given that so many Somalis live in overcrowded camps and other dwellings, this will not always be possible.
Hand-washing facilities have been set up in some of the camps, but as Mr Hashi says: ""Social distancing is an abstract issue.""
Some believe Covid-19 is a divine punishment imposed on China for its treatment of the Muslim Uighurs""
Osman Aden Dubow, deputy minister of religious affairs, says: ""We have to use the sheikhs [religious leaders] and koranic teachers to fight this disease as they are the most respected community in Somalia.
""People trust them more than anybody else and will not only listen to what they say but follow their instructions.""
However, the religious community is going to have a hard time combating some of the coronavirus myths taking hold in Somalia.
Some believe Covid-19 is a divine punishment imposed on China for its treatment of the Muslim Uighurs.
Now that it has taken hold in the US, some say Americans are being punished because they oppress Muslims. Others simply believe that if one is a good Muslim, one cannot catch the disease.

- The fake coronavirus stories spreading in Africa
Somalia's most senior sheikh, Ali Dheere, is adamant that the involvement of the religious community will help bust myths and encourage Somalis to do the right thing.
He says that, even though most Somalis are observant Muslims, they will understand that life cannot continue as usual.
They have been encouraged to pray at home and either not attend burials or to maintain social distance during the funeral service.
""In Islam, anything that causes harm is not permissible. Prayers have even been suspended at the holy mosques in Mecca and Medina,"" Sheikh Dheere notes.
""If a person dies from coronavirus and it is not safe to wash the body, our religion allows someone to be buried without being washed,"" he adds.
Ceasefire plea
There are fears that al-Shabab will try to exploit some of the religious leaders' initiatives for their own advantage.
For example, they could attack the decision to close koranic schools or adapt religious practices.
They could step up their campaign to blame ""infidel"" foreign lands for bringing the virus to Somalia, as those initially infected with Covid-19 came from abroad.
However, some believe al-Shabab might lose support if coronavirus takes hold in the regions it controls, as it has even more basic health facilities than those in many government-controlled areas.
UN Secretary General António Guterres has called for a ""global ceasefire"" in the face of the pandemic.
The warring parties in Yemen have agreed to stop fighting; separatists in mainly English-speaking Cameroon have declared a temporary ceasefire.
But diplomats doubt that al-Shabab will lay down its arms, as the group has continued to carry out attacks since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus a global pandemic.
But there is hope that the outbreak could open the door to negotiations, in order to prevent mass deaths.
Low-level discussions have previously taken place during humanitarian crises to enable the delivery of some food aid and other assistance.
Optimists believe similar talks to help contain the spread of the virus could take place, and develop into more substantial negotiations, perhaps eventually leading to compromise and an end to the long years of conflict.

The national carrier said it may have to begin temporary lay-offs as demand sinks on its crucial Asian routes.
Majority state-owned carrier Finnair issued a profit warning on Friday morning, citing ""the fast-developing situation with the coronavirus and its wider than originally estimated impact on the global aviation market"".
The flag carrier predicted that its comparable operating result for the first quarter of this year will be lower than that from a year earlier.
Finnair now expects the situation to lead to lower demand and revenue in the second quarter of this year as well.
In early February, Finnair predicted that the direct financial impact of coronavirus during the first quarter would be ""relatively limited"" even if the cancellations of its flights to and from mainland China continued until the end of the quarter, i.e. late March.
Two weeks ago Finnair cancelled all flights to and from mainland China until 28 March due to the spread of the Covid-19 disease.
""As the coronavirus situation has entered a new phase with outbreaks in several new countries, we will take appropriate measures to adapt our costs, operations and resources to better match our revenues. While the spread of the coronavirus has had a limited impact on our operations so far, we now see a negative impact on demand,"" Finnair CEO Topi Manner said in a statement.
The airline also withdrew an earlier forecast that its capacity would grow by around four percent this year.
Finnair said it is looking into ways to cut costs by 40-50 million euros, focusing on personnel, sales and marketing activities as well as development initiatives.
The company earlier said it might furlough pilots but now says that personnel measures may affect all personnel, as well as recruitment.
Shares prices slump in Helsinki
Finnair's share price was down by around four percent as the Helsinki Stock Exchange opened on Friday morning.
In the early afternoon it was down by 2.8 percent. The whole OMX index was down by 3.5 percent, with major stocks such as Nokia, Kone, Stora Enso, Nordea and Wärtsilä faring worse than Finnair.
Finnair shares have lost almost a quarter of their value since 11 February amid worries over the virus's impact on the airline's crucial Asian routes.
At least two other European airlines also issued coronavirus-related warnings on Friday, with British Airways owner IAG, like Finnair, warning of a hit to profits and easyJet reporting a big drop in demand into and out of a virus-affected region in Italy. All three carriers announced cost cuts to help weather the storm."

In connection with the novel coronavirus outbreak in Estonia, online stores are seeing a significant increase in orders. Barbora, the online store owned by retailer Maxima Group, is also now offering contactless home delivery to its customers in order to combat the spread of the virus.
If a customer has chosen contactless delivery at online checkout, the Barbora courier will deliver the customer's order to the front door of an apartment or private residence and contact the customer to alert them that their order has arrived.
This service can only be utilized if the order does not include any alcoholic beverages and has been prepaid by online bank transfer.
The number of orders received by Prisma Peremarket's online store has skyrocketed as well, with the most popular items being ordered including hygiene products and non-perishable food. The price of an average order has also increased 30-40 percent.
E-Selver's online orders have likewise tripled, and Selver has responded by internally recruiting additional personnel to fulfill orders and reduce home delivery wait times.
The Health Board confirmed four new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Estonia on Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 17.

https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/29/kremlin-using-virus-outbreak-to-push-through-putins-reforms-proekt-a70136,Kremlin Using Virus Outbreak to Push Through Putin Reforms : Proekt,"The Kremlin is attempting to take advantage of Russia’s coronavirus outbreak to maintain President Vladimir Putin’s popularity and ensure that the public votes for his constitutional reforms, the Proekt investigative outlet reported Wednesday, citing unnamed federal officials.
The reforms would potentially allow Putin, 67, to extend his 20-year rule into 2036. Putin postponed a public vote for the constitutional amendments, originally scheduled for last Wednesday, and declared a “non-working” period after Russia saw a sharp spike in Covid-19 infections.
Here are the key takeaways from Proekt’s investigation:
Kiriyenko kickstart
— Sergei Kiriyenko, Putin’s first deputy chief of staff who’s in charge of the constitutional reforms vote, tested positive for Covid-19 in mid-April, Proekt said. Kiriyenko reportedly recovered in three days and his second and third tests were negative.
— Before that, the presidential administration’s domestic policy bloc, which is responsible for elections and voting, had actively opposed introducing quarantine measures that would disrupt its fully formed plan for the April 22 vote.
— A “panicked” mayor’s office in Moscow, the epicenter of Russia’s Covid-19 outbreak, served as another key factor that ultimately led Putin to postpone the vote. It will now either be held in June or sometime this fall.
— Everyone in the presidential administration’s domestic policy bloc now gets tested for Covid-19 at least once a week. At the cabinet level, only those who directly contact Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin get tested for Covid-19. The other staffers are required to wear face masks.
PR for Putin
— The Kremlin reportedly watched with irritation as social media users and opposition activists speculated about Putin’s alleged self-isolation during the outbreak in mid-March.
— With Putin’s public approval ratings dipping during his four-day stay in Crimea as Western leaders actively communicated with their populations regarding the pandemic, a federal official recalled that “we need to do something too.” In the ensuing days, Putin visited Russia’s top coronavirus hospital in Moscow and declared a nationwide paid “non-working” period.
— Putin’s public address led to a bump in the polls. Thereafter, the Kremlin reportedly developed a strategy to maintain the public’s loyalty toward the authorities. It included Putin regularly addressing the public and daily news reports showing him discussing efforts to fight the Covid-19 outbreak with officials.
— The good-PR strategy extended to ordering Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to cede his scheduled remarks announcing support measures for citizens and businesses to Putin in mid-April.
— “It’s important to come out of this so that the people would understand that nothing would have happened without the leader,” an unnamed federal official was quoted as saying.
Overshadowing Sobyanin
— Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin’s skyrocketing visibility amid the outbreak, which was reflected in public trustworthiness ratings, irked both Mishustin and the Kremlin. Putin’s public approval ratings, meanwhile, slightly dipped amid talk of his absence.
— Officials and state-backed journalists now present Sobyanin’s actions as “the advancement of presidential instructions” as part of the Kremlin’s strategy to ensure good PR for Putin.
Regional loyalty
— Kiriyenko’s domestic policy bloc apparently distributed guidelines to regional authorities on boosting voter loyalty at the height of the Covid-19 outbreak. These included blocking negative news online, attracting elderly voters through online classes, recruiting volunteers and organizing online challenges and flash mobs.
— While some regions attempted to act on some of the ideas, others froze preparations for the vote on Putin’s constitutional reforms, citing their focus on dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak."

Influenza season is expected to peak in March in the Uusimaa region, which includes Helsinki.
This winter's influenza season will become more active over the next few weeks, predicts Eeva Ruotsalainen, deputy chief physician of the infectious diseases division of Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH, also known as HUS).
""So far 19 people have been in intensive care or monitoring in the HUCH region. About 80 percent of them have had underlying conditions and were not vaccinated,"" she tells Yle.
Three of this season's intensive care patients have died.
""The mortality rate is 16 percent, which is quite high. On an annual basis, the mortality rate of patients in intensive care or being monitored for influenza varies between 10 and 20 percent,"" she explains.
Ruotsalainen particularly urges those in risk groups to get flu jabs from their local health centres. The risk groups are small children, people over age 65, pregnant women and anyone with an underlying serious disease. It takes about two weeks for the inoculation to provide full protection.
""The influenza season is expected to reach its height in March, so there is certainly still time to get vaccinated,"" she says.
Protection against four viruses – but not novel corona
The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has imported about 1.7 million injection doses of influenza vaccine to be administered free of charge to those in risk groups and their immediate circles, as well as 116,000 doses for children in the form of a nasal spray.
Ruotsalainen says that some 700,000 injection doses remain unused.
""About 1.03 million shots have been administered around the country,"" she says. ""At the moment about half of those over 65 have been inoculated, along with about a third of children under age seven.""
The seasonal flu shot is a quadrivalent, meaning it provides protection against four different flu viruses that are now circulating in Finland and elsewhere in the world, but these do not include the new form of coronavirus. Only one case of that illness has been confirmed in Finland.
""It protects against two A viruses and two B viruses. For instance, one of them is AH1N1, a progeny of swine flu that is now circulating as a seasonal flu, and seems to be proliferating here in Finland this season,"" says Ruotsalainen.
EDIT 11.2.2020: The headline on this story originally suggested there was a 16 percent mortality rate from flu in Helsinki. That has now been removed from the headline."

https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/04/16/tracking-covid-19-excess-deaths-across-countries,Daily chart - Tracking covid - 19 excess deaths across countries | Graphic detail,"AS COVID-19 has spread around the world, people have become grimly familiar with the death tolls that their governments publish each day. Unfortunately, these tend to under-count the true number of fatalities that the disease has already caused. In many places, official daily figures exclude anybody who did not die in hospital or who did not test positive. Often the cause of death takes several days to establish and report, which creates a lag in the data. And even the most complete covid-19 records will not count people who were killed by conditions that might normally have been treated, had hospitals not been overwhelmed by a surge of patients needing intensive care.
[Jump to Lombardy, Spain, France, England and Wales, Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Austria, New York City, Jakarta or Istanbul]
A better way to measure the damage caused by such a medical crisis is to look at “excess mortality”: the gap between the total number of people who died from any cause, and the historical average for the same place and time of year. The charts below use data from EuroMOMO, a network of epidemiologists who collect weekly reports on deaths from all causes in 24 European countries, covering 350m people.
Compared to the baseline average of deaths from 2009-19, the flu seasons of 2017, 2018 and 2019 were all unusually lethal. But the covid-19 pandemic, which arrived much later in the year, has already reached a higher peak—and would have been far more damaging without social-distancing measures. EuroMOMO’s figures suggest that there were about 120,000 excess deaths between March 16th and April 19th.
We cannot compare EuroMOMO’s reports directly to official covid-19 tolls, because the organisation does not publish absolute numbers of deaths for each country. Instead, we have gathered data separately from statistical bureaus around the world (see table below). Some Western nations began releasing regular updates in early April, as we first reported at the time. A few—such as Italy and the Netherlands—show an excess of deaths that is double the official covid-19 tally for the same period.
That discrepancy will surely be greater in poorer countries, which have less capacity for testing and treating patients. For example, data about burials in Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, suggest that the official covid-19 figures in March might have captured only 5% of the true toll. As more places start to publish their total mortality figures, The Economist will report and analyse them on this page.
Italy was the first European country to be overrun by the virus. On April 27th its official count of covid-19 deaths was nearly 27,000. Yet the true toll is much higher. Giorgio Gori, the mayor of Bergamo, a northern town hit especially hard, has said that the daily data are “the tip of the iceberg…too many victims are not included in the reports because they die at home.” The official covid-19 tally, published by the ministry of health, includes only people who tested positive before passing away.
So far, Italy’s national statistical bureau has published figures of deaths from all causes for only 1,700 of the country’s 7,900 municipalities, covering the period until April 4th. We have analysed a sample of these areas, including Bergamo, which contain 7.2m of the 10m residents in Lombardy, the worst-affected region. Between March 1st (the week Lombardy passed 50 official fatalities) and April 4th, this sample suffered about 6,100 official covid-19 deaths, according to our estimate. In the same period, it registered 12,800 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 48% of the true estimated excess.
Spain has experienced a similar outbreak, with its official death toll nearing 24,000 on April 27th, according to data from hospitals. Like Italy, the country’s overall mortality data imply that the actual number is higher, although the extent of the undercounting is less severe.
Spain’s national epidemiology centre is publishing figures for deaths from all causes. Between March 11th (the week Spain passed 50 official fatalities) and April 14th, the country recorded 18,000 official covid-19 deaths. In the same period it registered 26,800 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 67% of the estimated excess.
France’s official death toll accelerated rapidly in April, after its central health authority began including people who died in nursing and care homes. By April 27th, nearly 40% of the 23,000 recorded national fatalities came from such institutions. Our chart for the whole of France includes these extra numbers. But our charts for individual regions do not, because the care-home data have not yet been broken down geographically.
France’s national statistical bureau has published figures for deaths from all causes up to April 13th. Between March 10th (the week France passed 50 official fatalities) and April 13th, the country recorded 14,900 official covid-19 deaths, including those from care homes. In the same period it registered 17,400 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 86% of the estimated excess.
Britain’s daily covid-19 toll, which is published by the health ministry and based on submissions from hospitals, reached 21,000 on April 27th. However, the national statistical bureau has produced an expanded covid-19 estimate after analysing the probable causes mentioned on death certificates up to April 17th. These revised numbers are shown in our charts.
Between March 14th (the week England and Wales passed 50 official fatalities) and April 17th, the region recorded 19,100 official covid-19 deaths, according to the revised estimate. In the same period it registered 27,000 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 71% of the estimated excess.
The official covid-19 death toll in the Netherlands stood at 4,500 on April 27th. However, the national institute for public health, which publishes the daily figures, includes only people who have tested positive for the virus (often with a delay).
The Dutch national statistical bureau has published figures for deaths from all causes up to April 19th. Between March 16th (the week the Netherlands passed 50 official fatalities) and April 19th, the country recorded 3,700 official covid-19 deaths. In the same period it registered 7,600 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 48% of the estimated excess.
Sweden’s approach to fighting the virus has received much attention, as it is one of the few Western countries that has not enforced a widespread lockdown. On April 27th its official covid-19 death toll was just 2,300, counting only people who had tested positive before passing away.
The Swedish national statistical bureau is publishing regular figures for deaths from all causes. Between March 25th (the week Sweden passed 50 official fatalities) and April 7th the country recorded 1,500 official covid-19 deaths. In the same period it registered 1,700 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 90% of the estimated excess.
After adjusting for population, Belgium has one of the highest official covid-19 death tolls in the world. On April 27th it stood at 7,200. The country’s health experts have pointed out that this high number includes victims who had coronavirus-like symptoms but did not test positive (many of whom died outside of hospitals). The official covid-19 figures have also been retrospectively adjusted to list deaths on the day they happened, rather than the day they were eventually reported.
The Belgian national health institute has also released figures for deaths from all causes, up to April 12th. Between March 16th (the week Belgium passed 50 official fatalities) and April 12th the country recorded 4,500 official covid-19 deaths. In the same period it registered 4,900 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 93% of the estimated excess.
Like neighbouring Germany (which has yet to release recent total mortality data), Austria locked down early and has suffered relatively few deaths from the virus. On April 27th its official covid-19 death toll was less than 600, counting only people who had tested positive before passing away.
The Austrian national statistical bureau has released figures for deaths from all causes, up to April 5th. Between March 23rd (the week Austria passed 50 official fatalities) and April 5th the country recorded 188 official covid-19 deaths. In the same period it registered 330 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 57% of the estimated excess.
After trailing behind the death tolls of many European countries at first, America’s official death count has risen sharply. By April 27th it had recorded nearly 55,000 victims, more than any other country. Though most American states do not publish recent records of deaths from all causes, the city of New York, the worst-affected area, has provided weekly data up to April 11th.
New York’s health department has also adopted a similar approach to Britain’s statisticians, by expanding its definition of covid-19 fatalities and analysing death certificates retrospectively. As of April 27th, it has found an additional 5,200 people who had “probably” died of the virus, along with the 11,700 victims who had tested positive at that point. We have included these revised figures in our chart.
Between March 15th (the week New York passed 50 official fatalities) and April 11th, the city recorded 10,300 official covid-19 deaths, according to the revised estimate. In the same period it registered 11,000 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers, after including “probable” covid-19 fatalities, account for nearly all the excess deaths.
Indonesia is one of the first developing countries to have released data about excess mortality—not an official count of deaths from all causes, but instead a tally of burials from Jakarta's department of parks and cemeteries. Typically, the department records about 2,800 burials a month (accounting for roughly 75% of all people who die in the city). But in March, the department reported 4,400 burials, suggesting an excess of at least 1,600 fatalities.
Although Jakarta has been the epicentre of the covid-19 outbreak in Indonesia, at the end of March its official death toll was just 84, barely 5% as high as the excess burials. Even on April 19th, the city’s official tally of dead was still only 290. This suggests that the country is drastically under-counting the severity of the outbreak.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, insists that his government has taken every precaution to fight covid-19, despite not imposing a full lockdown. On April 27th the country’s official death toll stood at 2,900. The last time the government produced a regional breakdown of the figures, on April 1st, Istanbul had roughly 40% of the nation’s deaths and 55% of confirmed cases.
However, data about burials from the city’s government suggest that between March 22nd and April 25th Istanbul suffered at least 3,100 excess deaths, when compared to the same period in previous years. If we assume that the city has had roughly 1,300 of Turkey’s official covid-19 deaths, this means that the government’s reported figures only cover 45% of the estimated excess.

TOKYO (AP) — The Japanese economy shrank at an annual pace of 6.3% last quarter as growth was battered by typhoons and crimped consumer spending.
The seasonally adjusted economic data released Monday by the Cabinet Office comes amid looming fears about the economic damage expected from the new viral illness COVID-19 that began in China late last year.
Japan’s gross domestic product, or GDP, the sum of the value of a nation’s products and services, slipped 1.6% in the last three months of 2019 quarter-on-quarter.
The annualized rate shows what the drop would have been if that same pace had continued for a year.
The contraction for the October-December period was the first Japan had in more than a year. The amount of decline was the worst in about five years.
The news sent the Nikkei 225 benchmark stock index falling in trading Monday.
Domestic demand fell in the quarter at an annual pace of 8.0%.
Hurting people’s spending was the rise in the consumption tax from 8% to 10% in October.
Both exports and imports fell during the quarter.
The new viral illness is likely to affect various aspects of the economy.
Japan had been counting on Chinese tourists in recent years to sustain growth, but visits have dwindled to a trickle.
Japanese companies have halted or adjusted production, because of supply chain disruptions or work suspensions at their own factories in China.
Overall consumption is likely to drop as people avoid crowds.
“The concerns for the export focused economy is continued pressure amid the coronavirus,” said Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG in Singapore of Japan’s GDP.

The flag carrier will furlough some pilots after cancelling its Chinese flights.
Finnair is beginning co-determination talks with 700 long-haul pilots due to the coronavirus situation. The national airline has cancelled all of its roughly 200 flights to and from China through the end of March.
The negotiations, which begin next week, are aimed at gauging the need for temporary layoffs.
""We're preparing for a prolongation of this situation. Negotiations start next week and will include discussion of possible temporary furloughs,"" says Finnair's media relations director Päivyt Tallqvist.
Voluntary time off so far
When the airline announced its 2019 results last Friday, CEO Topi Manner said he believed the coronavirus situation would be a passing one with a limited impact on the company's finances.
At that point Manner said that the carrier's overstaffing due to the flight cancellations was being handled by offering employees more training and the option of voluntary leave.
Tallqvist said that the assessment of the financial impact had not changed, but that the firm is bracing itself for the possibility that the crisis may drag on.
""This is part of our overall preparedness for a potential continuation of the situation. When we talk about this number of cancellations, we have to evaluate the effect on our human resources needs,"" Tallqvist tells Yle.
Dozens of airlines have halted flights to and from China, and many companies have also called off business trips to the country.
Hong Kong-based carrier Cathay Pacific has laid off 27,000 people, or nearly its entire workforce, for three weeks due to the new form of coronavirus.
The disease has killed at least 1,367 people, nearly all of them in China. On Wednesday, the World Health Organisation officially named it Covid-19."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/coronavirus-chinese-vendors-supply-chains-toy-manufacturers,Coronavirus causes  upheaval and uncertainty  for toy manufacturers | World news,"Coronavirus causes ‘upheaval and uncertainty’ for toy manufacturers
About 85% of products for the toy industry are located in China – and each day, supply chains see new virus-related problems
“It feels like a rollercoaster, but the dip down is followed by another dip down,” said Jay Foreman, chief executive of Basic Fun, a toy distributor in Boca Raton, as the coronavirus outbreak started to play havoc with his business. “We’re waiting for the carriages to start going back up, but I think we’re going to have to wait a little longer.”
Like many US businesses, Basic Fun is reliant on China for its manufacturing. Each day, Foreman receives updates from his vendors in China, where about 85% of products for the $80bn global toy industry sources are located. And each day, supply chain problems related to the global outbreak of Covid-19 mount.
At this time of year about 400 million Chinese workers should be returning to factories after the lunar new year, but this year there’s no sense that even if they do, Chinese vendors will have materials or transportation to restart production.
“There’s challenges with truckers getting through provinces to the ports, there are too many containers and not enough boats, or too few containers and not enough boats. There’s upheaval and uncertainty, and everyone is on pins and needles until we understand the significance of this.”
For the time being, US toy consumers – children – have little to fear. This is a slow period for the industry, and stocks are plentiful. But come May, when summer demand picks up, or into the holiday season, when it peaks, the story could be very different.
With toy manufacturing centered in China, opportunities to reconfigure global supply rapidly are limited, said Steve Pasierb of the New York-based Toy Association. “The story is changing day to day but fortunately we’ve still got another 40 to 60 days before it becomes a crisis.”
Jessica Alcalde, a product sourcing consultant in New York, echoed that sentiment. “If it keeps going on through July and August it will become a serious concern for a lot of people.”
According to Foreman, Chinese vendors may be open for business but production lines aren’t necessary running. Many factory owners, he said, report that their workers will need to be quarantined before starting work, but it’s unclear where that quarantine is taking place except in what Chinese authorities describe as “special places”.
With 100 employees in the US, 85 in Hong Kong and 10 in China, Basic Fun will have little choice but to trim expenses and jobs if the supplies dry up. Nor can the company simply pivot to other toy-producing nations, since most get their components from China.
“If we can’t get product, we’re going to be upside down, and if we’re upside down, there’s only one way to stabilize the balance sheet and that’s by cutting costs,” Foreman said. “We’re in uncharted territory, that’s for sure.”
This story is being told across industries, with every type of consumer product, from bridal dresses to mobile phones, cars and luxury products to pharmaceuticals, looking at potentially severe disruption over the coming months.
A trickle of warnings about supply chain issues earlier this month has become a cascade of alerts. Almost no globally integrated industry appears immune, triggering US stock indices to register their worst US weekly drop since the 2008 financial crisis, down about 12%.
It’s too early to predict the full impact of the crisis on the US economy. The rout in stock markets suggests it could be serious but could just as easily evaporate if the Covid-19 outbreak wanes. But already Federal Reserve officials are signaling they are open to an interest rate cut if the outbreak worsens.
And global supply line interruptions, like those experienced by Basic Fun, are one of the clearest indicators of economic damage.
“Every single leg of the supply chain has exposure to disruption,” said Richard Wilding OBE, professor of supply chain strategy at Cranfield University. The disruption, Wilding said, is governed by unintended consequences. “With Italy, for example, they stopped trains going into Austria. As soon as that happens, you’ve got to ask if freight is also stopping.”
Even if production in China is restored, transportation may remain seized. Shipping containers are stacking up in Chinese ports, leading to shortages in other parts of the globe.
More tonnage of container ships is idled now than during the global financial crisis, according to Alphaliner, a shipping data service. Charter rates for tankers and bulk freighters have plummeted more than 70% since early January, according to Hong Kong-based Mandarin Shipping.
The knock-on to industry is already apparent. Credit agency Moody’s predicted global auto sales volume could drop 2.5% year-over-year, with Chinese sales sinking 2.9%. On Wednesday, Microsoft shares fell 2% after the company said it doesn’t expect to meet the quarterly revenue guidance.
Apple, with nearly 290 of 800 Chinese component suppliers centered in Wuhan, has said it does not expect to reach its own quarterly revenue guidance as a result of impact from Covid-19.
The luxury goods industry, affected by virus outbreaks in northern Italian production centers and by a sharp drop in Chinese consumer spending that accounts for 30% of global sales, could be more severe.
Global luxury manufacturers have taken a $25.5bn stock hit, with sector leader LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton accounting for over half of that decline, as dozens of other industry leaders have issued missed earnings warnings.
For the time being, the resilience of supply, production and transportation systems remains key to mitigating economic damage.
Still, interruptions to global supply chains are often not easily or quickly countered.
American Axle & Manufacturing, an auto parts maker based in Detroit, has said it expects about $25m in lost sales during February and early March as car manufacturing slumps in China. Tesla, which recently opened a Shanghai factory to build models for Chinese customers, said last month it expected the disruptions to “slightly impact” profitability.
With nearly 1,600 cases of Covid-19 reported in South Korea, and community transmission outbreaks reported in Germany and the US, supply chain issues may intensify, said Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS. Businesses discounting potential disruptions because of the yearly disruption of lunar new year “are awakening to the fact that there will be delays from China but also new areas”.
A recent report from Fung Business Intelligence worried that nations newly affected by the virus might not be able to deal with a coronavirus outbreak as efficiently as China, where the rate of new infections appears to be dropping.
“For a number of reasons, be it political or economic, these countries might not be able or willing to take containment measures as stringent as China, which could doom their efforts to contain the Covid,” the report said.
“The Covid-19 is no longer a China issue or an Asian issue, but a global issue,” it added."

A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak
- Follow our latest coronavirus blog for live news and updates
Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:
Global confirmed cases exceed 3.65 million
Researchers at Johns Hopkins University say at least 3,656,644 people have been infected since the outbreak began, while at least 256,736 are known to have died. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the outbreak.
White House wants to wind down Covid-19 task force
Mike Pence has confirmed that the Trump administration is reportedly looking to wind down the coronavirus task force in the coming weeks, even as the rate of new infections continues to rise across most of the US. Meanwhile at least 70,847 people are now known to have died in the USA, according to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That represents more than a quarter of all pandemic-linked deaths reported across the world.
Donald Trump says it’s time to reopen businesses
Speaking in Arizona at a factory manufacturing medical masks, Trump said it was time to reopen businesses. “Will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.” he said.
Asia Pacific nations push to end lockdown
Several Asia Pacific countries are aiming to ease their lockdowns and kickstart their economies, including South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong. Vietnam is also easing its restrictions but the country’s economy, in which tourism plays a major role, faces a severe test.
Record daily deaths in Brazil
According to the nation’s health ministry, there have been 6,935 new cases of the novel coronavirus in Brazil since Monday evening and 600 new deaths. The previous record of 474 deaths came on 28 April. Meanwhile the capital of tropical Maranhão state ground largely to a halt Tuesday, becoming the first major Brazilian city to enter a lockdown in the hopes of preventing the coronavirus pandemic from overwhelming the health care system of one of the country’s poorest states.
UK youth unemployment may reach 1 million
Youth unemployment in Britain will reach the 1 million mark over the coming year, a thinktank has warned, saying that Britain faces the risk of a “dole queue” future for young people unless the government provides job guarantees or incentives for school leavers and graduates to stay on in education.
Covid-19 lockdown risks 1.4 million extra TB deaths by 2025: study
The global lockdown caused by Covid-19 risks a “devastating” surge in tuberculosis cases, with nearly 1.4 million additional deaths from the world’s biggest infectious killer by 2025, new research showed on Wednesday. New disease models showed that social distancing could lead to a disastrous rebound in TB infections – the effects of which are set to persist for years. This is because social distancing will make it impossible for health care workers to test vulnerable populations and for patients to access ongoing treatments.
New Zealand reports one new case after two days with no cases
After two consecutive days of zero new corona cases reported, New Zealand reported one new case of the virus on Wednesday, and one new death. Director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said New Zealand wasn’t out of the woods yet and needed to stay the course: “We need everyone to stick to the plan and follow the rules… not doing so risks undoing all of the good work we’ve done so far. Do not give it an inch.”
The pandemic has cost Walt Disney US$1.4bn in the last three months
Walt Disney will kick off its strategy next week to begin restoring its lucrative parks business that has suffered $1bn in lost profits from the coronavirus-led shutdown. Disney said on Tuesday it will reopen its Shanghai Disneyland park on May 11 but severely limit the number of guests and enforce strict social distancing measures on rides and in restaurants."

The Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday new emergency protocols allowing allowing the plasma of those who've recovered from the novel coronavirus to treat patients who are critically ill with COVID-19.
Why it matters: The number of coronavirus infections in the U.S. had risen to almost 54,900 and the death toll to 783 by Tuesday night. Per the FDA, it is possible that this treatment, convalescent plasma, ""contains antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) might be effective against the infection.""
The big picture: Doctors in China have treated coronavirus patients with convalescent plasma. The method was also used during the 1918 flu epidemic.
- New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced Monday trials for the convalescent plasma treatment in the state, which has become the COVID-19 epicenter, with at least 14,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in New York City alone.
What they're saying: Cuomo stressed that it's ""only a trial.""
- ""It's a trial for people who are in serious condition, but the New York State Department of Health has been working on this with some of New York's best health-care agencies, and we think it shows promise, and we're going to be starting that this week,"" he said."

All eyes are on the quiet northern region that is now the subject of what is hoped will be a groundbreaking study, Oliver Moody reports
For a few weeks the people of Heinsberg, a quiet corner of Germany jammed up against the Dutch border, were treated like the lepers of northern Europe.
Retail chains refused to deliver goods to their homes. The region’s handymen and technicians were insulted and spat upon when they travelled outside the district.
A short drive away in the Netherlands, cars with Heinsberg’s numberplate were jeered as “corona spreaders” or forced to park in segregated spaces.
Some residents say the hysteria became so severe that they were physically prevented from getting out of their vehicles.

More than 10,000 people have died in New York City due to the coronavirus in confirmed and probable cases, per newly released data from the city's health department.
The big picture: New York City's revised toll means that over 28,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus as of Tuesday, per data from Johns Hopkins.
Details: The more than 3,000 new fatalities logged by the city's health department refers to New Yorkers who did not test positive for the virus, but whose death certificates list COVID-19 as a suspected cause of death, NYC health department spokesperson Michael Lanza confirmed to Axios.
- ""We are committed to consistent reporting and with case definitions now established, we are making this information available to the public,"" Lanza said, when asked what prompted the New York City health department to include probable cases.
- On April 5, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists approved the CDC to log probable cases of COVID-19 along with confirmed cases, in a statement on establishing a standardized case definition for the virus.
What's next: States like Ohio, Connecticut and Delaware recently began reporting probable coronavirus cases, per the New York Times. The country's death toll is likely to increase dramatically as more probable cases are included in state data.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/opinion/corona-bonds-european-union.html,Opinion | Europe Needs to Come Together . But Not Like This . ,"HAMBURG, Germany — Spider-Man, that force for good, taught us that with great power comes great responsibility. That’s especially true in times of strife. So in the midst of arguably Europe’s worst crisis since 1945, is Germany — the continent’s powerhouse — living up to its great responsibility?
This week may tell us. On Thursday, the heads of the European Union’s governments are meeting to discuss the introduction of so-called corona bonds, which would distribute countries’ debt across the continent. Several southern European states insist such bonds are essential to help fund the reconstruction of their economies, after the ravages of the coronavirus. But Germany, the Netherlands and other northern countries are strictly against the policy. It is bound to be a historic showdown.
The introduction of corona bonds might be a strong symbol of cohesion — but the joy will be short lived. They will in time cause damage from which Europe might not be able to recover. In the interests of the long-term well-being of Europe, it’s Germany’s great responsibility to resist them.
It’s entirely understandable that Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy has called for a rescue package of at least 1.5 trillion euros, around $1.63 trillion — and that he sees no other ways of creating the cash flow than by issuing collective bonds. But Mr. Conte should consider two things. First, this is not the euro crisis, with its starkly uneven effects: The coronavirus has hit the economies of Germany and other European countries in much the same way as it has Italy’s. Second, Germany and others are absolutely willing to help. But this readiness does not stretch to scrapping a fundamental principle of the eurozone — that the union shall not be liable for the commitments of single governments.
To cross this red line would do more harm than good. Corona bonds would breach a founding principle of the eurozone, a core promise that helped convince the Germans of the idea of the euro in the first place: Every country is responsible for its own budget and no one will be allowed to live at the expense of others. Even if intended to be temporary, corona bonds would be viewed as an opening of the floodgates. They would not only reawaken anti-European populist parties like the Alternative for Germany, whose support has been falling. By showing how malleable the rules can be, they would also spread euroscepticism far into the political center.
Sure, not granting the bonds is feeding populists in the south — like Italy’s opposition leader Matteo Salvini. The rescue package of 500 billion euros, around $540 billion, agreed to by E.U. governments this month, inflamed him: He is furious that Italy should have to “beg” for money. What’s more, this rescue money could come from the European Stability Mechanism, an emergency cash box created during the euro crisis, its funds carrying harsh conditions. For many Italians, accepting assistance from it feels humiliating; hence the call for corona bonds instead. Yet the Italian populists merely wield a sentiment, while the Germans have an argument. Corona bonds are simply not necessary to master the crisis.
First, rescue funds would come without tough conditions for Rome this time around. The German finance minister made it clear that it would be “inappropriate” in the current situation to make aid dependent “on fundamental debates about the pension system, the tax system, and the labor market.” So it’s baseless to reject the European Stability Mechanism as a mean, disciplinary tool.
In addition, the European Central Bank has already decided to buy extra state bonds this year to the tune of 750 billion euros, nearly $814 billion. This act of solidarity enables Italy and other southern European states to keep their sovereign bonds low, meaning they can borrow much more cheaply than they would otherwise be able to. In other words, Europe is printing money to help Italy. A third fund, possibly worth around 1.5 trillion euros, has been suggested by the European Commission and will be up for debate on Thursday, too.
The truth is that the challenge for the European Union is far bigger than the usual quarrel between north and south. Europe needs to generate money for continentwide reconstruction — for a new Marshall Plan. But the coronavirus has been weakening Europe’s economic immune system, leaving it unable to defend itself. The European Commission has warned, for example, that China could go on a shopping spree, buying out hundreds of cash-strapped European companies.
So the real question for Europe should be how to strengthen its defenses. Possible steps would be to make the continent a more friendly place for start-ups, cutting red tape wherever possible, especially in sectors like climate-friendly technology. It’s time for vision. How about Europe strives to bring the first hydrogen-powered airplanes to the world market, for a start? While the ruinous effects of the coronavirus have given rise to extraordinary solidarity, it is of a compressed, jealous kind. That attitude needs to change, north and south.
And yes, there is need for strong symbolic action, too. Here’s an idea that would help immediately: Germany currently has 10,000 free intensive-care beds, while Italians and other Europeans are dying because their health care systems are overstretched. More critically ill patients should be airlifted to the country to receive treatment — not just a few dozen, but a few hundred. That should be a moral imperative.
Europe’s past has been difficult, often antagonistic. But the union is strongest when it builds a common future where countries can thrive together. Spider-Man, after all, was a networker.

https://www.dw.com/en/culture-in-the-time-of-corona/a-52739306,"Culture in the time of corona | Culture| Arts , music and lifestyle reporting from Germany | DW","All around the world, cultural events are being canceled due to the coronavirus. A few concert halls are now trying to counter this trend this by going ahead without an audience — and sharing live-streams online instead.
The world-famous Teatro La Fenice in Venice remains eerily quiet as the Dafne string quartet enters the stage. The musicians walk up and take a bow — despite the fact that there is no audience inside the massive concert hall, which can seat more than 1,000 people. As the four artists take their seats, violinist Federica Barbali can't help but chuckle at the awkward and unusual situation.
For a moment, you can hear a pin drop throughout the stunning rococo theater, originally built in 1792; then the quartet starts to play Ludwig van Beethoven's String Quartet No.4, Op.18 No.4. And as the music fills the void, you're suddenly reminded of the fact that you're watching this event from the comfort of your home.
The show must go on
The Teatro La Fenice decided to live-stream the concert online, as Italy is effectively under a nationwide lockdown. Cultural events have been canceled throughout Italy and Europe in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus. But that doesn't mean that all public life has to stop; in order to ensure that cultural life continues, organizers are coming up with new formats to channel their events.
On Twitter, the concert stream by the Teatro La Fenice is one of many things shared under the hashtag #iorestoacasa — which translates as ""I'm staying home."" Italians from across the country are using the hashtag to talk about their lives under quarantine conditions and to show solidarity with those who have been infected by the coronavirus.
But there's also a sense of solidarity with the string quartet, performing under such unique circumstances. As the online audience continues to comment on the performance, mostly expressing their gratitude for the beautiful concert, one user reminds the other viewers that they are still watching a musical performance — by shushing them on the digital realm as if they were inside the theater.
The Dafne string quartet is by far not the only group of classical musicians resorting to streaming as an alternative during these challenging times. The Symphony Orchestra of Giuseppe Verdi in Milan was also forced to play in front of an empty house earlier in March while streaming the concert online. Their chosen hashtag during the stream was perhaps a more poetic one: #Lamusicanonsiferma — the music won't end.
In neighboring Switzerland meanwhile, the Lucerne Orchestra had to find a different solution. After returning from a tour in northern Italy last month, all musicians were placed under quarantine. Facing the reverse problem of having a full auditorium but no orchestra to play during a performance of Richard Strauss' opera ""Salome,"" the organizers decided to offer a simple piano accompaniment instead.
No country in the world was hit as badly by the coronavirus crisis as China, where the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra was also forced to cancel its shows. Instead of performing on stage, many of the musicians took to the Chinese social media hub WeChat, where they shared videos of their music practice at home, as well as instructional videos.
Museums in China had already started sharing social media posts about their collections back in January in hopes of helping those under quarantine conditions overcome their boredom.
Sustainable alternative?
As the coronavirus outbreak is also hitting Germany, several theaters and concert houses decided to take precautions in accordance with regional guidelines on large public gatherings. In Cologne, the Gürzenich Orchestra canceled all events with an audience of more than 1,000 people following recommendations by German Health Minister Jens Spahn to that end.
Geoffry Wharton, who was the concertmaster of the Gürzenich Orchestra for over 30 years, says that in his long-spanning career, he had never seen anything like the measures taken now.
""I've witnessed cancellations before but nothing like this. The closest this actually came was to the experience I had on the 11th of September, 2001. Nobody knew that day what the proper thing to do was. They obviously thought about canceling the concert completely but the musicians were all there, so what they ended up doing was they changed the program. But even then, we didn't cancel,"" the US musician and composer told DW.
Like the orchestras in Italy, the Gürzenich Orchestra also decided that instead of cancelling, it would also consider live-streaming as an option. Wharton says he was happy to see the orchestra try new things, as he followed a recent performance online in real time. However, he added that it might not be a sustainable solution in the long-run: ""It was nice that they did it this way, but the thing is that people actually want to go to these concert halls to see shows. And when they have to stay at home for months instead, the model of live-streaming may not be a viable solution,"" Wharton said.
""And this is where I worry about a lot of my colleagues and friends who are freelance. Nobody knows what's actually supposed to happen to freelance musicians with concerts that don't happen.""

Oil prices nosedived to four-year lows Sunday as trading resumed after Friday's collapse of the OPEC-Russia production-limiting pact, a rupture slated to increase supplies at a time when the novel coronavirus is sapping demand.
The state of play: The immediate 31% collapse when trading resumed last night was the second-largest on record behind the 1991 Gulf war, Bloomberg reports.
- Brent crude was trading at roughly $34.94 on Monday morning, which is actually above the troughs reached since trading resumed Sunday night.
- But consider that it was pushing $70 in early January and began Friday around $50.
What's new: The International Energy Agency slashed 1.1 million barrels per day from its 2020 oil demand forecast on Monday as the coronavirus outbreak crimps travel and economies.
- The agency now sees a year-over-year drop in demand for the first time since 2009.
- Their central case sees a slight 90,000 bpd annual drop, but they warn it could be significantly more. On the other hand, in a more optimistic virus containment scenario, there could still be demand growth.
Three things to watch to make sense of the oil market's unraveling...
1. A break or a breakup: It's not clear whether or when the OPEC+ alliance might resume cooperation.
- ""The lines of communication between Russia and Saudi Arabia are always open,"" oil analyst Ellen Wald tells Axios, noting their energy ministries are in touch on topics beyond oil production.
- But, but, but: ""Saudi Arabia and Russia have fundamentally different priorities when it comes to oil production and oil sales,"" says Wald, author of the book ""Saudi, Inc.""
- ""Whereas Saudi Arabia sees great benefit in maintaining its position within OPEC, Russia is not a member and does not care about the communal benefits of OPEC decisions,"" she says.
- The question now is ""which producer blinks first,"" per S&P Global Platts' Chris Midgley. He says in a note that while low prices will test Saudi finances, their low production costs and low debt means they can ""pull on sovereign reserves and take the pain.""
2. Shale patch pain: The price collapse will hurt U.S. shale producers, who are already facing tough economics and Wall Street pressure to show returns, not just boost output.
- Look for producers to scale back. How much depends on how low things go and for how long, although companies' hedging strategies provide some cushion.
- Goldman Sachs analysts, in a note this morning, gamed out a scenario in which U.S. oil prices were in the $30–$45 range into 2021. Producers would ""meaningfully cut back activity"" to preserve cash flow and balance sheets, although it depends in specific companies' hedging positions.
- And per a note this morning from the risk analysis firm Verisk Maplecroft's Niamh McBurney: ""The impact of this on U.S. shale producers, and how much they may retrench, is what OPEC, and specifically Saudi Arabia and Russia are banking on to be able to return them to their pre-2016 positions, or at least close.""
3. U.S. political fallout: It's certainly a new wrinkle in the 2020 election.
- Falling crude prices will push gasoline prices even lower, which would presumably favor President Trump.
- But, but, but: Oil production is vital to the economy in a bunch of states, including the swing state of Colorado and of course Texas.
- Texas hasn't voted in favor of a Democratic White House hopeful since 1976 but could be a longshot hope for Trump's opponent.
- Democrats could make the case that the industry's pain underscores the need to push more quickly into clean energy.

Any other country in the world would have simply reported that the prime minister had fallen ill, had informed the president and had checked into the hospital. End of story. In Russia, though, nothing is ever that simple.
There had to be a reason why they trotted out Mishustin for this show. It means that in some Kremlin office with plush carpets and massive oak tables, senior officials debated the question and reached a weighty decision.
And they wanted to announce it Western-style, like an episode of “The Crown.” For all appearances, it would be no different from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson informing Queen Elizabeth II that the coronavirus had left him temporarily indisposed.
But the Russian version did differ in at least one major way: the Kremlin authorities had spent the last 20 years convincing the people that their leaders are powerful, unaccountable to the public, and rock solidly enduring.
So why shatter that illusion now?
Before answering, we must ask whether this was the only such episode in recent days. No, it was not. These days, Russian officials regularly give public statements with something resembling transparency — as much as that is possible for people who have not practiced sincerity for a very long time.
It does seem that official statistics for the number of confirmed Covid-19 infections in Russia are accurate. Even though the figures do not include the sudden surge in deaths from pneumonia that are most likely attributable to the novel coronavirus, the overall progression of cases perfectly matches mathematical models predicting its spread — the same models that revealed the exact extent of ballot stuffing in previous elections.
After initially secluding himself in quasi-quarantine, Putin has begun making almost weekly appeals to the nation and conducting frequent live briefings. It is in this context that we should consider the announcement of Prime Minister Mishustin’s illness.
Russian citizens instinctively expect their leaders to lie to them during crises — just think “Chernobyl” — but the authorities now seem intent on proving that they are not hiding anything.
With tens of millions of Russians on lockdown and deprived of their livelihoods, it is clear that Kremlin leaders in that very same meeting decided not to pour fuel on this smoldering fire of constant irritation.
Russia’s leaders are at a loss as to how to proceed with their Constitutional amendments and they are likely to face cheap oil prices and a weakened economy long after the pandemic subsides.
They either cannot or do not want to make direct payments to citizens suffering financial loss. So all they can do is at least try not to lie and to act like Boris Johnson with the queen. For Putin and his pals, that is already a lot."

Schools and colleges are today to receive guidance on what to do if they come into contact with the coronavirus amid confusion over how to handle an expected rise in cases.
Head teachers in areas where the virus, officially known as Covid-19, has been detected have been telling parents that they will authorise absences for families wishing to self-isolate.
Public Health England (PHE) is today expected to publish guidance clarifying that schools where a staff member or pupil is suspected of having the virus do not need to close.

An accurate estimate of the incubation period for a new virus makes it easier for experts to predict the dynamics of the outbreak and find a balance between draconian control measures and eliminating the spread.
As of Monday, the disease has infected 109,000 people and killed 3,800.
Italy has banned all non-essential movement across the country and ordered the closure of schools, gyms and museums.
An analysis of COVID-19 infections by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health revealed an estimated median incubation period of 5.1 days — longer than for typical common colds.
The study found that less than 2.5 percent of showed symptoms within 2.2 days while 97.5 percent showed symptoms within 11.5 days.
Public health experts have been using a 14-day quarantine period based on estimates, but the Johns Hopkins data suggests that it is just about right for COVID-19.

The researchers estimated that, for every 10,000 individuals quarantined for 14 days, only about 101 would develop symptoms after being cleared and released.
“Based on our analysis of publicly available data, the current recommendation of 14 days for active monitoring or quarantine is reasonable, although with that period some cases would be missed over the long-term,” said study senior author Justin Lessler, an associate professor in the Bloomberg School’s Department of Epidemiology.
The study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, looked at 181 cases detected before February 24 where the likely dates of exposure and presentation were known."

But there are also fresh signs that the infection is hitting economic growth and corporate profits.
S&P Global has predicted that growth in the UK and the Eurozone will be hit, perhaps 0.2% lower than expected this year. Manufacturing will bear the brunt, they say, due to disruption as Chinese factories.

New Zealand has flattened the curve of novel coronavirus cases after two weeks of lockdown and the next phase is to ""squash it,"" professor Shaun Hendy, who heads a scientific body advising the government on COVID-19, told Axios.
Why it matters: Te Pūnaha Matatini, the Center of Research Excellence hosted by the University of Auckland of which Hendy is director, released research Thursday showing there could've been hundreds more Covid-19 cases were it not for the lockdown — and there's a good chance the strict measures will help stamp out the virus.
- The country imposed 15 days ago some of the toughest restrictions in the world in response to the pandemic, despite confirming only 102 cases and no deaths at the time.
How it works: Under alert level 4 restrictions, schools and non-essential businesses closed — including food delivery services. Only essential travel is permitted, and water activities like swimming are banned.
- People must remain at home unless they're exercising outdoors — but they have to stick to their neighborhood and only interact with those in their household ""bubble,"" keeping at least 6.5 feet from others.
- A New Zealand Police spokesperson told Axios that 367 Covid-19 breaches had been recorded, including 45 prosecutions, as of Wednesday. People have been arrested for offenses like obstruction of a person assisting a medical officer, or being in breach of the Civil Defense Emergency Management Act.
What they're saying: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told a briefing Wednesday she's ""cautiously optimistic that we are starting to turn a corner,"" as she announced 50 new cases — the lowest daily coronavirus total in two weeks amid a surge in testing. On Thursday, health officials announced 29 new cases.
- Hendy noted there had been a ""flattening off"" of cases in the past week. ""We haven’t seen any further growth,"" he said. ""We had that big rise in numbers, mostly driven by people coming back from overseas and we seem to have managed to have contained that growth.""
""The fact that our numbers have stayed level, that’s due to our lockdown. ... We can be pretty optimistic we’ve flattened it and now it’s about can we bend it right down, can we squash it?""— Hendy on the coronavirus curve
By the numbers: New Zealand has 992 confirmed infections, 247 probable cases and one death from 51,165 tests, according to the Ministry of Health. 317 people have recovered from the virus.
What's next: If COVID-19 is contained, New Zealand is expected to drop to alert level 3, which the country only experienced for two days before moving to full restrictions.
- Ashley Bloomfield, director-general of health, told a briefing Monday this would involve ""more widespread activity happening with more people back at work, but maintaining those strict things around physical separation, hand hygiene ... to prevent infection.""
The big picture: Ardern acted decisively early on. New Zealand had six confirmed cases when she announced on March 14 a ban on foreigners entering the country, saying: ""We must go hard and we must go early."" Businesses and workers have been compensated in a range of measures as part of a $12.1 billion support package.
- The response has been bipartisan, with Opposition Leader Simon Bridges offering his support to the government. Following pressure from his National Party and epidemiologists, Ardern announced Thursday all returning New Zealanders must be quarantined in isolation for at least 14 days from their arrival date.
- Ardern has been widely praised for her leadership during the coronavirus crisis, and for reassuring children at a news conference this week that the tooth fairy and Easter bunny are essential workers.

https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/26/coronavirus-prevention-how-effective-are-masks-closed-borders-screenings-and-quarantines,"Coronavirus prevention : How effective are masks , closed borders , screenings and quarantines ? ","Numerous tactics are being employed by nations and individuals around the world to protect themselves from the spread of the coronavirus, or COVID-19.
Some methods are personal, such as the purchase of a face mask, while others are deployed on a large scale to detect the SARS-like illness ahead of time.
But which of these preventative measures are the most effective - and are any of them simply unproductive?
Point of entry screenings
Screening for COVID-19 at airports and other points of entry has been widely criticised due to the incubation period of the illness.
It is believed that infected people can be asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms in the first 14 days and yet still be contagious.
By the time more noticeable symptoms have arisen—enough to be picked up by thermal scanners—a person may have passed through several screenings undetected already.
One recent study estimated under ""best-case assumptions"" that such screening measures would miss around 50% of cases.
Another predicted a slightly better outcome of only 46% of infected travellers entering a country undetected.
Closing borders
The recent outbreak in northern Italy has led to Austria—bordering to the east—considering whether to implement border control.
France, which borders to the west, has said it is not yet considering such controls but has admitted the situation is ""worrying"".
However, studies into the effectiveness of travel bans and restricting borders have found the method may delay the spread of an illness, but probably won't quash it.
A University of Boston-led study found the lockdown of Wuhan—the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak—on January 23 may have been too late as other Chinese cities would have received lots of infected people by this date.
It said: ""The travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only three to five days.
But on the international scale, it added, there would be a ""more marked effect"" where it is estimated ""the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February.”
Others have compared it with travel restrictions put in place to quell the spread of influenza—which is believed to be less transmissible than COVID-19—and found “limited effectiveness of this policy”.
According to a piece by scientists at the Yale Institute for Global Health: ""International travel bans have to be highly restrictive (i.e. discontinuation of over 90% of air travel) to have any impact.
""Even then, these restrictive measures only slightly delay the spread of the infection and have a very small impact on the magnitude of outbreaks.""
Masks
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends people only wear masks if they are exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 ""to help prevent the spread of disease to others"", but those who aren't should not.
""If an individual is infected...a face mask would help prevent transmission to others,"" Jennifer Lighter, a hospital epidemiologist and assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine told Euronews.
But ""there is no reason for the general population to wear face masks,"" she said.
Others have pointed out the distinction between two types of mask that people are investing in most - the N95 respirators and surgical masks.
Both masks serve different purposes when worn.
For example, the respirator keeps air particles away from the mask wearer, whereas the surgical mask stops germs from the wearer's mouth reaching anyone else.
The N95s are ""designed to protect the user"" whereas masks ""protect the patient,"" Joseph Kwan, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told AFP.
Quarantine
Governments have put into place quarantine and self-isolating procedures for anyone who has been infected or exposed to the virus.
The Yale Institute for Global Health points out that quarantines are effective when a disease is transmissible ahead of symptoms being present - which is believed to be the case of COVID-19.
But others have pointed out the sensitivity of getting the quarantine right.
Speaking to the National Geographic, Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University professor who is also director of the World Health Organisation Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law, said the recent quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship was an ""unmitigated disaster"".
Thousands of passengers were isolated aboard the ship off the coast of Japan for two weeks after a case of COVID-19 was confirmed.
The number of cases between passengers and crew in the early stages rested at ten people, but a fortnight later had surpassed 600.
""What should have happened is, they [the passengers and crew] should have been disembarked from the boat and placed in isolation or medical quarantines,"" Gostin said.
Cancelling events
A number of huge events around the world, including the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, a Six Nations match between Italy and Ireland, and other major sporting meets, have been affected after organisers cited concerns over COVID-19.
The World Health Organisation has advised that the cancellation of public events should be considered in the case of ""widespread community transmission"" of the virus being established.
But, some events organisers predict that other factors are involved in such decisions outside of high-impacted areas.

Event management expert Julius Solaris, who runs an event management blog part of Skift, said there could be factors relating to the number of attendees to any particular event being cut due to travel restrictions or fears of corporate liability if a company sends a representative to an event only to get sick.
Speaking specifically about the Mobile World Congress, he said: ""We all can safely assume that Asia is a hot market for mobile phones.
""Not having attendees from the countries under COVID-19 watch is a big drawback for those investing money in the event.""
He added: ""This is the case for many events around the world. I am receiving many, many off the record messages from planners that are cancelling their events both internal and external because Asian colleagues cannot attend.""
Other preventative methods (from the World Health Organisation):
Social distancing - building specialist hospitals, quarantines
Close monitoring of effectiveness of health strategies
Giving populations the tools to identify symptoms and reduce risk of transmission
Intensive source control - isolating patients, contact tracing, health monitoring, strict health facility infection prevention and control, continued active surveillance and containment activities
Preparations for resilience in various countries
Preventative methods with personal hygiene (from Public Health England)
- Wash hands often with soap and water, especially after using public transport. Use a sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
- Avoid close contact with people who are unwell.
- Always carry tissues with you and use them to catch your cough or sneeze, then bin the tissue and wash your hands (or use a sanitiser gel)."

The move comes after a new Russian study placed the accuracy of the country’s Covid-19 tests at 70% to 80%, with the rest being false negatives. Russia is currently the world’s 17th-most affected country with 11,917 officially reported coronavirus cases Friday.
“We see that the course of the disease is sometimes so quick that it has a distinct clinical picture,” Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said in an interview Thursday.
“That’s why it’s diagnosed without laboratory confirmation. It’s standard practice for doctors,” Murashko told the state-run Rossia television channel.
His interview follows Moscow doctors’ decision to treat all pneumonia patients as potential coronavirus patients because the fast-spreading virus often causes pneumonia.
A sharp spike in pneumonia cases in the Russian capital in March stoked concerns about the accuracy of coronavirus tests in the country, Reuters reported at the time.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin warned residents Friday that “we haven’t reached a peak” in coronavirus infections yet."

Did stocks tank on Monday because they were finally noticing danger signs that the bond market has been screaming about for weeks? Or did equities just react in a reasonable way to the rapid spread of Covid-19 in South Korea and Italy over the weekend?
The answer matters because overexuberant shares tend to fall further and faster than they otherwise would. That means the virus-induced stock selloff could turn into a nasty recoupling if there was an irrational divergence between bonds and the stock market. ...

https://www.economist.com/china/2020/02/13/xi-jinping-sends-in-the-hard-men-to-deal-with-the-wuhan-virus,Big changes in Hubei - Xi Jinping sends in the hard men to deal with the Wuhan virus | China,"WHEN SECRETIVE, Leninist parties have bad news to get out of the way, they do not hang about. In the space of a single day, February 13th, China’s ruling Communist Party fired the officials who run the province and city at the heart of the epidemic of covid-19, announced a big jump in the number of recorded virus infections there, and sent in hardliners close to Xi Jinping, the country’s supreme leader, to clean up the mess.
The unusually brutal reshuffle saw the top party post in the central province of Hubei, where more than 48,000 infections and 1,310 deaths had been recorded as The Economist went to press, handed to the mayor of Shanghai, Ying Yong, who is 62. Mr Ying’s background is in public security, the law courts and the feared discipline-inspection commission that roots out malfeasance by officials. He earned Mr Xi’s trust while serving as a police chief and discipline inspector in the coastal province of Zhejiang, when Mr Xi was Zhejiang’s party boss from 2002-07.
Public anger is seething over weeks of bungling and cover-ups by officials responsible for fighting the virus in Hubei and Wuhan, the provincial capital. A handful of brave doctors, academics and relatively outspoken journalists have been pleading with national leaders to allow for more openness and free debate to avoid further deadly policy blunders. Mr Xi and his inner circle appear to have granted half that request, offering greater transparency about virus numbers, matched with sterner party discipline.
State media are at pains to note that new cases outside Hubei have been growing less common since February 4th. But on February 12th Hubei reported 14,840 new infections, a sharp rise. This followed instructions from the central government to count not just cases confirmed by nucleic acid tests performed on nose or throat swabs (kits for that are in short supply and not always reliable), but also patients whose lungs show telltale signs of covid-19 on CT scans.
Hubei’s new chief, Mr Ying, indicated his preferred approach to governing a province in remarks he made in Shanghai a few days before his transfer. He praised “non-sloppy” administrations that are brave enough to endure strict supervision. Mr Xi’s war on sloppiness will be fought in Wuhan, a city of 11m people that has been under lockdown for weeks, by Wang Zhonglin, who has taken over as the city’s new party chief. He is also an ex-cop.
After some days of hesitation, when Mr Xi was unusually absent from state media, the Chinese president and party chief appeared on February 10th in Beijing to inspect a hospital and address hard-pressed doctors in Wuhan by video link (see picture). Wearing a face mask and submitting to a nurse who took his temperature, Mr Xi pledged victory in a “people’s war” against the virus, but also expressed concern about the economic costs of nationwide quarantines. His emphasis on the party’s absolute leadership is reflected in the latest personnel moves. During a deadly outbreak of the SARS virus in 2002-03, the health minister and the mayor of Beijing were sacked. The reality has always been that such government officials are outranked by party leaders at each level of administration. The reshuffle in Hubei makes that explicit.
Other officials with experience of high office in Zhejiang are being deployed. One of them is Chen Yixin, the secretary-general of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the party’s main law-enforcement body. He has been sent as Mr Xi’s envoy to oversee virus-control work in Wuhan. Meanwhile Xia Baolong, who was Mr Xi’s deputy in Zhejiang, has been appointed head of the central government’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, putting a Xi loyalist in charge of another crisis—anti-government unrest that has roiled Hong Kong since June.
Among China’s embattled Christian community, both Mr Chen and Mr Xia are notorious for leading a campaign to strip crosses from the roofs of churches in Zhejiang. When trouble strikes in Mr Xi’s China, the party sends for the hard men. ■

World-leading specialists offer support to Chinese scientists amid ‘crackpot’ theories that virus was manufactured in a lab
- Coronavirus – latest news
World-leading experts on the novel coronavirus have signed a statement of support for their Chinese colleagues, who are being attacked on social media and even threatened with violence as false rumours circulate about its origins.
There is a real risk that the open and transparent relationship between the Chinese scientists and their western counterparts will come to an abrupt end, impeding the sharing of data and the hunt for treatments and vaccines against Covid-19, warned Dr Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance in the United States, whose research into emerging diseases led to the identification of the bat origin of Sars, among others.
Daszak is one of 27 prominent public health scientists from nine countries who have signed the statement published by the Lancet medical journal. They include Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust in the UK, Jim Hughes, former director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases in the USA, Rita Colwell, former head of the US National Science Foundation and other leaders in infectious disease research and public health.
“We work very closely with the Chinese scientists. We have had incredible openness with the labs in China for the last 15 years, since Sars,” said Daszak. “We collaborate on what are dangerous viruses and get incredible information that helps public health around the world. That is all under threat right now.”
The Chinese scientists and their families have been abused on social media and threatened with violence. They are saying, said Daszak, “we are not going to talk, because every time we speak we get criticised and threatened”.
Conspiracy theories circulating on social media claim the coronavirus was artificially manufactured in a lab conducting bioweapons research. They are “crackpot theories that need to be addressed, but in the age of social media it is just impossible,” said Daszak.
As with the conspiracy theories around MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination, those promulgating the rumours are in their own social media echo chambers.
And as with anti-vaxx theories, the unfounded rumours have then been amplified by mainstream politicians such as the US senator Tom Cotton, and international news platforms such as the Daily Mail.
The signatories to the statement, says Daszak, have put their reputations on the line in support of their Chinese counterparts who are being targeted. “There are scientists out there trying to save our lives,” he said. “They have been doing this for 15 years since the Sars outbreak.”
The Lancet letter is a “statement in support of the scientists, public health professionals, and medical professionals of China combatting Covid-19”.
“The rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins. We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2) and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens,” it says, linking to all the scientific evidence published so far.
The director general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom, has also warned against rumours and misinformation, speaking of the “infodemic” that needs to be fought alongside the epidemic.
The statement continues: “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus. We support the call from the director-general of WHO to promote scientific evidence and unity over misinformation and conjecture. We want you, the science and health professionals of China, to know that we stand with you in your fight against this virus.”
It calls on other scientists to sign up to the statement. The signatories have also launched a change.org petition for public support."
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-budget.html,Germany Bans Groups of More Than 2 to Stop Coronavirus,"BERLIN — Germany on Sunday barred groups of more than two people from gathering, except for families, and Chancellor Angela Merkel later said she herself was going into isolation because her doctor had tested positive for the coronavirus.
Ms. Merkel said she would isolate herself at home effective immediately after learning that a doctor who vaccinated her against pneumonia on Friday was infected, her office said in a statement. The chancellor will be tested regularly in coming days while carrying out her duties from home.
News that their leader was in quarantine quickly overtook headlines about the far-reaching social-distancing measures she had just announced.
The new rules, which will be in place for at least two weeks, are among the strictest imposed by any country on movement outside the home, and they came as global infections surpassed 300,000 and the death toll topped 13,000. In Germany, the number of confirmed cases had risen to more than 23,900 by Sunday, with more than 90 deaths.
“The coronavirus is spreading with worrying speed through our country,” Ms. Merkel said in a televised news conference on Sunday.
In the absence of a vaccine or a cure, she said, it is up to people to curtail their interactions, she said.
“Our own behavior,” she said, “is currently the most effective antidote we have: to reduce public life as much as is possible, to reduce contact with people through whom the virus could be transmitted.”
“In short,” she said, “that’s how we save lives.”
The chancellor, a trained scientist, has won wide praise for her calm and transparency during the crisis.
“We have to learn from experts — and from observing reality,” Ms. Merkel told Germans on Sunday.
Even with the chancellor in isolation, officials said, the government will continue operating as planned, with the cabinet preparing on Monday to make 150 billion euros — more than $160 billion — available to help the country weather the fallout.
Latest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak
- Nations tackle lockdown next steps.
- Coronavirus cases rise in India as lockdown eases.
- Putin’s approval rating plummets as Russian crisis deepens.
Under the new restrictions, restaurants, which were previously allowed to seat customers during the day at a safe distance from each other, will be allowed to stay open but provide only delivery and takeout services.
Other businesses that had previously been allowed to stay open, among them hairdressers, massage studios and tattoo parlors, must now close their doors.
People will still be allowed to go to work, and to leave the home to care for relatives, shop and visit their doctors. Meetings deemed essential and exams can still take place, and people will be allowed out to go outside to exercise or get some fresh air — as long as everyone keeps a distance of 1.5 meters, or four feet, from one another.
Ms. Merkel’s announcement, made after a telephone conference with the governors of Germany’s 16 states, came after restrictions were put in place by the state of Bavaria, which on Friday severely limited movement outside the home.
In a major concession to the new reality, the German government also planned to take on debt for the first time since adopting a law requiring a balanced budget after the 2008 financial crisis. It is expected to approve an exception and borrow tens of billions of euros to help companies survive the looming recession and to secure millions of jobs.
The package is expected to be passed by Ms. Merkel’s government on Monday and voted on in Parliament later in the week.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz justified the decision to borrow more than 10 times more than the country’s budget rules would normally allow, saying that “150 billion is a very big sum, but it gives us the opportunities that we need now.”
“We have a big challenge ahead of us,” he told the public broadcaster A.R.D. on Saturday.
Germany is just one of many countries limiting crowds to promote social distancing and stall the transmission of the coronavirus.
The United States government has said that no more than 10 people should gather in one place. Switzerland says people in groups of fewer than five must stay at least two meters (six and a half feet) apart, of face a fine. Austria’s chancellor, too, announced major restrictions on movement in public places, banning gatherings of more than five people.
The stringent restrictions imposed in Germany on Sunday were announced after the authorities said too many Germans were not following social distancing guidelines set last week.
The chancellor thanked the many Germans who have radically changed their lifestyles. And she warned those who have not yet done so that the rules are not optional.
“These are not recommendations by the state,” she said. “They are rules that have to be followed in our collective interest,”
Those who disobey them, she said, will be punished.
In a direct appeal to those who have taken a casual approach to social distancing, the chancellor said: “Please all join in. Do what is right for out country. Show reason and heart.”
“I am convinced this collective spirit, this ‘we stand for each other,’ will carry us through this difficult time,” Ms. Merkel said.
Some German cities have needed no prompting to clamp down.
In Freiburg, near Germany’s southwestern border with Alsace, France, the virus has been particularly aggressive in its spread, and local officials last week barred groups of people from gathering in public spaces.
Still, some other Germans have taken a far more cavalier, even defiant, approach.
There have been reports of “corona parties” held by youths in different corners of Germany, causing alarm among the authorities in a country better known for its citizens’ adherence to the rules. Some of the parties, where youths in large groups drank alcohol and chanted, “Corona, corona,” had to be broken up by the police.
On Wednesday, Ms. Merkel, in a somber address to the nation, asked Germans to avoid social contact in a spirit of solidarity with those most at risk in society. A day later, her chief of staff, Helge Braun, issued a sterner warning.
“We call on everyone to implement the measures so far passed,” Mr. Braun said. “And that means, apart from your core family, avoiding ideally all social contacts.”
“We will look at the behavior of the population this weekend,” he said. “Saturday is a decisive day.”
Ms. Merkel, meanwhile, demonstrated what responsible shopping looks like in the time of the coronavirus when she was spotted at her local supermarket in Berlin this weekend.
Keeping her distance from other shoppers, a smiling chancellor placed cherries, soap, several bottles of wine and toilet paper — one pack — into her shopping cart, photos on social media showed.
The chancellor paid by card, joining those Germans dispensing with a time-honored tradition: paying cash. Many stores have become averse to exchanging coins and notes during the outbreak.
Ms. Merkel acknowledged the toll the new rules of behavior are taking in a society used to freedom.
“Today we see everywhere in Germany that our cities, our traffic, our economic and private life look completely different from only a week ago,” she said. “I thank you for it. I know it means economic and human sacrifice when shops have to close, when you can’t just mingle with other people, or what is even more painful, see grandparents, meet friends.”"
https://www.economist.com/china/2020/02/17/the-coronavirus-spreads-racism-against-and-among-ethnic-chinese,The pathogen of prejudice - The coronavirus spreads racism against and among ethnic Chinese | China,"“YO VIRUS-BOY! Don’t infect us!” So Andrew Zhou, a Chinese-Canadian in Vancouver, has been taunted in the school playground. On February 8th Hao Chunxiang, a Chinese university student in the Netherlands, complained on Facebook that the lift in his dormitory had been spray-painted with the words “DIE CHINESE”. In Japan the hashtag #ChineseDon’tCometoJapan has been trending on Twitter. Rhea Liang, a doctor in Australia, tweeted that one of her patients had refused to shake her hand because of her ethnicity.
Amid global anxiety about the spread of the new coronavirus, first detected in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the tens of millions of ethnic Chinese living outside China and Taiwan are particularly uneasy. Anecdotal evidence abounds that fear of the virus is generating racial phobia against them. The virus has so far infected more than 70,000 people and killed more than 1,700.
Political leaders have expressed concern. The prime ministers of Canada and Australia, which have large ethnic-Chinese populations, have publicly condemned anti-Chinese racism resulting from the outbreak. So, too, has the Chinese government. Its foreign ministry has repeatedly warned against discrimination by foreigners, referring both to ethnically targeted attacks and to perceived insults to China itself. A cartoon in a Danish newspaper of the Chinese flag with its stars replaced by coronaviruses was one cause of outrage, including on Chinese social media, where many called the artwork racist. Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, responded that “we have freedom of expression in Denmark—also to draw.” The World Health Organisation has come up with a name for the disease, covid-19, that is intended to avoid any association with China.
Ethnophobia triggered by the virus is sometimes subtle, and hard to separate from overblown fears of the pathogen itself. A waiter at a Chinese restaurant in London’s Chinatown says business is down “by at least 70%” since the virus began to spread globally in mid-January. Far fewer customers who are not ethnic Chinese are turning up, he says. A Malaysian student at University College London says he decided to skip class for a week in late January because “half the class is Chinese”. He worried that some students may have received infected relatives from China over the lunar new year holiday.
Some ethnic Chinese are fighting back. A social-media campaign in France, using the hashtag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus (“I am not a virus”), has inspired hundreds to share their own stories of rudeness. Some are non-Chinese Asians who say they have suffered collateral damage. In Australia, some ethnic-Chinese have launched a petition accusing two newspapers of using racially offensive language in connection with the virus. Tens of thousands of people have signed it.
Ethnic Chinese themselves sometimes indulge in virus-related profiling, by fearing or suspecting people from Hubei province where Wuhan is—or even mainland Chinese in general. On February 2nd, when America banned the entry of any non-American who had recently been in China, many Western commentators complained about its discriminatory undertones. Canada did not follow America’s lead. But Ryan Zhang, who lives in Burnaby, a Canadian city where a third of the population are ethnic Chinese, says most of the ethnic Chinese in his community want Canada to do so. He says they have a paranoid fear that travellers from China wanting to enter America might first stop in Canada for a while and infect others before going on.
Perhaps the biggest fissure within the diaspora relates to hostility among people from Hong Kong towards those of mainland origin. Recent pro-democracy unrest in the territory has exacerbated such tensions. One Canadian of Hong Kong origin refers to mainlanders who buy up surgical masks in Canada as “locusts”. This is a popular epithet in Hong Kong for people from across the border who go on shopping sprees in the territory, emptying shelves of goods. Ethnic solidarity is sometimes absent even within China itself."

A British couple who have been quarantined on a cruise ship off Japan for the past two weeks have tested positive for coronavirus.
David and Sally Abel have been held in quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is docked off Yokohama, since February 3, and are now among 454 passengers to have tested positive for the virus.
“There is going to be a time of quiet. We have been proved positive and leaving for hospital soon. Blessings all,” he wrote on Facebook today.
Mr Abel, who is from Oxfordshire, nevertheless expressed doubt over the diagnosis in a subsequent post, after he and his wife were taken to a hostel rather than a hospital.

Russia has reported 18,328 overall coronavirus cases and 148 total deaths, making it the world’s 15th most-affected country as of Monday.
“We see that the situation is changing almost daily and, unfortunately, not for the better,” Putin said at a video conference with health officials.
“The number of people who are getting sick is increasing, with more cases of severe illness,” he told three federal officials and Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, who is overseeing Russia’s coronavirus task force.
Moscow, with 11,513 confirmed cases, accounts for an overwhelming majority of Russia’s Covid-19 infections.
Sobyanin has warned that the outbreak was “nowhere near” its peak, while his deputy said that Moscow’s hospitals and ambulances were stretched to the limit.
Russian health officials estimate the daily growth rate of infections at around 17% and say that other regions are around three weeks behind Moscow in case numbers.
Putin said Monday that Russia could draw on its millitary capacity to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
“What the Defense Ministry is using abroad is only a small fraction of what it has. We need to keep in mind that its main reserves are still in reserve,” he said.
Putin has previously dismissed fears of a coronavirus outbreak, saying the situation in Russia was ""under control."""

A religious group in South Korea has been identified as a coronavirus hotbed, officials say, amid a sharp rise in confirmed cases in the country.
The infections among members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony (Shincheonji) are linked to one woman.
The sect in the city of Daegu accounts for 30 of 53 new cases, with officials warning of an unprecedented crisis.
South Korea also confirmed its first death from the disease Covid-19.

- Are coronavirus tests flawed?
The coronavirus, which originated in China's Hubei province, causes pneumonia-like symptoms.
China has now seen 2,118 deaths and recorded nearly 75,000 infections.
On Thursday, Japan said two of its passengers who contracted the coronavirus on board quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess had died. The man and the woman were in their 80s.
What about the outbreak among sect members?
South Korean health officials believe that the infections are linked to a 61-year-old woman who tested positive for the virus earlier this week.
The Korean Centre for Disease Control says the woman - who has not been identified - had contact with 166 people, who were asked to self-quarantine.
At least 30 of the new Covid-19 infections were on Thursday recorded among sect members in Daegu, a city of about 2.5 million people in the south-east.
The Shincheonji, which has been accused of being a cult, said it had now shut down its Daegu branch and that services in other regions would be held online or individually at home.
The mayor of the city has described the event as an ""unprecedented crisis"" and urged people in the city to stay indoors. Commanders on a nearby US military base also imposed access restrictions, news agency AFP reported.
What is the Shincheonji?
- Religious organisation founded in 1984 by South Korean national Lee Man-hee
- Lee, now in his 80s, describes himself as ""the promised pastor"" mentioned in the Bible
- Followers are taught to believe that Lee is the second coming of Jesus Christ
- Shincheonji is the abbreviation from Korean of ""New Heaven and New Earth""
- Reportedly has more than 120,000 members around the world
- Accused of being a cult, and has been involved in controversies in several countries
What's the overall picture in South Korea?
The number of confirmed cases now stands at 104.
New cases were also reported in the capital Seoul and the nearby North Gyeongsang province.
Meanwhile, the authorities revealed that a man died on Wednesday from pneumonia believed to have been caused by the coronavirus.
The 63-year-old man - who has not been publicly named - died in hospital in the south-eastern city of Cheongdo.
He was among 15 people at the hospital who had earlier tested positive for the virus.
The victim had been bedridden for more than 20 years at the hospital, Yonhap news agency reports.
What's the latest from the Diamond Princess ship?
The ocean liner was carrying 3,700 people in total and passengers who tested negative for the virus began leaving the ship on Wednesday after a 14-day quarantine.
Hundreds have now disembarked from the cruise liner docked in Yokohama. Others are set to leave over the next two days.
More than 150 Australian passengers have already arrived in Darwin, where they will begin two weeks of quarantine.
The first batch of people from Hong Kong have also flown back to the city, where they will similarly be quarantined.
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Britons stranded on the ship would be able to board an evacuation flight home on Friday, as long as they were not showing symptoms of the virus.
Indonesia is also set to repatriate its citizens.
In other developments:
- Chinese nationals were barred from entering Russia as of Thursday as a precautionary measure
- Australia extended until 29 February its ban on international arrivals who had been to China
- Residents in central Ukraine blocked roads to try to stop a planeload of coronavirus evacuees from China being quarantined there

https://time.com/5802135/even-in-a-pandemic-congress-is-locked-in-partisan-funding-fight/,Congress Is Locked in A Funding Fight Over Coronavirus,"Americans’ trust in Congress has been sinking for years amidst lawmakers' partisan bickering. But if there was ever a moment where the country thought the polarized legislative branch might unify, it would be a moment like this one: as the nation confronts the deadly coronavirus pandemic that has swept many parts of the globe and is now spreading across the U.S. and disrupting years of economic gains.
But in the Capitol, nothing is that simple.
After a whirlwind 48 hours of negotiations with the White House, the House passed a broad coronavirus response package early Saturday morning that includes free testing for those in need, expanded food assistance programs and Medicaid funding for overworked local governments, and two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave.
Related
The legislation passed overwhelmingly Saturday – 363 lawmakers supported it, 40 opposed, and one voted present. But the opposition was still along partisan lines; all 40 lawmakers who opposed it were Republicans. (Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican party last year to become an independent, voted present.) Those voting against the bill argued that the text was provided too late for them to cast an informed decision, because the new text was officially released within an hour before voting started. ""Voting on a multibillion-dollar piece of legislation less than 30 minutes after being introduced is no way to conduct the People’s business,"" Rep. Debbie Lesko wrote on Twitter.
The final price tag was not immediately clear.
The legislation now heads to the Senate, which returns to Washington on Monday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had dismissed Democrats' initial version of the bill released March 11th as an ""ideological wish list"" said in a statement that while the chamber would need to review the bill, he believes ""the vast majority of Senators in both parties will agree we should act swiftly to secure relief for American workers, families, and small businesses.""
But the scramble to actually pass the legislation, and the dramatic two days that preceded the House vote, was symptomatic of the partisanship that has dominated the 116th Congress and has continued to grip the Capitol as the magnitude of the coronavirus crisis became increasingly clear. Even as a Senate aide was diagnosed with the virus Thursday evening and several lawmakers have self-quarantined, Congressional leadership from both parties rushed to reach an agreement on the contours of the stimulus package. By Thursday evening, the greater Washington area had effectively begun preparations to shut down, and Congress had been slated to begin a previously scheduled recess. But the Capitol, while now closed to tourists, was still filled with lawmakers unable to find consensus. It would take them another relentless 24 hours to do it.
President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose rocky relationship reached a nadir after his impeachment, did not speak throughout the negotiation process, with the President deputizing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to hammer out a deal. ""There is no need for that,"" Pelosi told reporters Friday night when asked about their lack of discourse.
But even though Mnuchin and Pelosi spoke nearly two dozen times in two days, the fate of bill garnering bipartisan support was still in Trump's hands, because Republicans would not support it without his explicit endorsement. And up until Friday evening, he was sending mixed messages. During his press conference Friday afternoon, he said the Democrats were not ""giving enough"" in negotiations. And he did not officially endorse the bill until 8:42 p.m. on Friday, nearly a full three hours after Pelosi announced Democrats had reached an agreement with the administration. ""I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening. This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers,"" Trump tweeted. He did not mention the involvement of Pelosi and House Democrats, who had crafted the initial legislation.
""We appreciate the President joining us with his tweet,"" Pelosi told reporters.
The sticking point in the negotiations, according to Republican and Democratic aides, was the paid family leave provision. Republicans were concerned that the policy would overburden the Social Security Administration, rendering the policy ineffective, and overwhelm small business. The final bill includes tax credits for small businesses, and exemptions for business with fewer than 50 employees.
""We could have passed our bill yesterday,"" Pelosi said prior to the vote. ""But, we thought it would be important to assure the American people that we are willing and able to work together to get a job done for them.""
Ultimately, the House achieved that objective – even if the path there was rocky."

When the tannoy blasts out a ""Team 700"" alert at Elmhurst hospital in Queens in New York City it is because a ""crash"" team is needed immediately. Someone is going into cardiac arrest.
In normal times that would happen maybe once a week. Yesterday, during the course of one 12-hour shift, there was a Team 700 announcement nine times. Not one of the patients survived, according to the young doctor I spoke to.
She is one of the residents in emergency medicine, and nothing in her training could have prepared her for the harrowing scenes she is witnessing on a daily basis at the epicentre of the epicentre of this outbreak. The hospital, which has a capacity of 282 beds, is now housing over 500 patients, according to the latest email sent round by the hospital administrators.
And though it has not been declared as such, it is the first Covid-19 hospital in the country. Yes, the ER still functions - but all other patients who were admitted have been moved out. Only those who are gasping for breath are given beds.
In the initial stages of the outbreak, it was the worried well who would be turning up in this poor neighbourhood, Elmhurst. Now everyone is sick. Really sick. Half of the patients are undocumented, and don't speak English - they work in restaurants and are hotel chambermaids. They are not ""plugged in"". The calls for social distancing have passed them by.
And this medic, in her early 30s, tells me the stress is intense. Nearly everyone who arrives at the ER needs to be intubated and put on a ventilator. That would normally be a job done in the Intensive Care Unit. But they are overloaded.
These people need ""pressors"" - meds that will keep blood pressure up. And that is a job normally done by specialist nurses. But there aren't the nurses to do it. So people who are untrained are having to do it. ""How can I not worry when there are patients not getting the care that they need?""
And she says it is not just the old who are falling prey to this. ""There are patients in their 30s and 40s with no pre-existing conditions. Equally, we had a 90-year old man the other day who was brought to the ER after he had fallen at home. He had a broken leg - but he also tested positive for coronavirus - even though he was exhibiting no symptoms.""
It is a confounding virus, is Covid-19.
The hospital has been given double the number of ventilators that it originally had - but they are already being fully utilised and they need more. All are being used - and the peak of the curve is still weeks away. And she talks rather quietly when she describes a situation where not all of the people who need a ventilator are getting one.
I spoke to this young doctor after she had got home from a 12-hour shift. We were connected by a mutual friend. She said she would call me after she'd put the washing on, cooked herself something to eat, and done a bit of life admin. The mundanities of life co-exist alongside the high stress, life-and-death environment that she is living in.
She says she is not frightened for herself. ""I am not worried about whether I fall ill. I will be fine. I'm young, and fit. I had a bit of a sore throat last week, and may well have had it. But the medics who are older, who have more complex medical histories are very nervous."" A dozen of her co-workers, though, have fallen ill.
Elmhurst the epicentre - by the numbers
- At least 47,500 people have tested positive in New York City as a whole - but the outbreak has not spread evenly
- Elmhurst and Corona have led New York in terms of confirmed cases: 831 and 947 respectively as of 31 March.
- In Corona, the median household income is approximately $48,000 (£38,806), a marked drop from the city's median of about $60,000
- These working class neighbourhoods are in Queens, the hardest-hit borough according to New York Times data, with 616 confirmed cases for every 100,000 residents
- Wealthier Manhattan and Brooklyn have counted 376 and 453, respectively, per 100,000 residents.
In normal circumstances, if you see a patient who you think is infectious you put on PPE (personal protective equipment), and when you have finished your consultation you take off the overalls and mask and they are incinerated. At Elmhurst you start your shift wearing PPE, and you will not remove it all day - after all, everyone you're seeing is infectious.
That has alleviated some of the pressure on kit. Also, the fact that this hospital has been the first hospital to be so much in the front line, and has had so much publicity, has meant that supplies have been forthcoming. She says, though, that her N-95 mask has to last a few days. But what happens to the hospitals further down the road? Will they get the kit they need?
I ask her whether she has had time to reflect on the enormity of what is happening. ""A bit,"" she says. But says that will probably come later. She says the focus right now is on doing her job, and saving as many lives as she can.
As she tells me this, the thought strikes me that if you're driving a car on a mountain road and the brakes fail, you haven't got time to ponder the vicissitudes of existence, you're just trying to get down the mountain safely.
This woman is calm, self-assured and having to be mature beyond her years.
Then she opens up on the bits that are hardest about what she is doing, and concedes that much of what she has gone through will need a lot of processing afterwards
""The most anxiety I have is around ventilator allocation. Seeing people die is not the issue. We're trained to deal with death. Nor is it the volume of people dying. The issue is giving up on people we wouldn't normally give up on.""
She described a patient being brought in from an old people's home. He was already on a ventilator - and was ""chronically vent dependent"". His prospects were never great. But all she could see before her was the ventilator - and not the patient.
""When he came in we were so desperate for vents,"" she told me, ""all I wanted to do was get the ventilator off him. I wanted to get that vent off him to allow it to go to someone else.""
Playing god is not what this young woman thought she would be doing at this stage in her career.

The city council for Antioch, Calif., unanimously voted on Friday during a special council meeting to remove city Planning Commission Chair Kenneth Turnage II in response to a pointed Facebook post the commissioner wrote on April 23. The council members sharply criticized Turnage’s statements and cited a public outcry for the need to address them. Council Member Lori Ogorchock said that she found Turnage’s comments to be “very insensitive and callous, especially towards the elderly” and that she had heard concerns about them from older residents.

In Turnage’s statement, which was re-posted by East County Today, he called for an end to ""stay at home"" orders, which are intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus, and to “let nature run its course”. Turnage compared the virus to a forest fire, which will destroy part of the forest “that drain the resources of the forest and [cause] it to be unhealthy.” Turnage said that while many elderly people would be lost to the virus, “that would reduce burdens in our defunct Social Security System, health care cost (once the wave subsided), make jobs available for others and it would also free up housing in which we are in dire need of.”
""This would run rampant through [the homeless] and yes I am sorry but this would fix what is a significant burden on our society and resources that can be used,"" Turnage concluded, ""In my opinion we need to adapt a herd mentality. A herd gathers it ranks, it allows the sick, the old, the injured to meet its natural course in nature.""
Turnage defended his comments during the special council meeting as free speech “intended to spark a debate.” He argued that there is a scientific basis for the principal of ecological balance and accused council members of engaging in “race-bating,” and of violating his First Amendment rights.
“My personal opinion had nothing to do with the city, or my position on the planning commission. So to try to somehow link them or create a nexus to further your political agendas is shameful,” Turnage said. He said that he was sorry that he could have chosen different “analogies.”
City Attorney Thomas Lloyd Smith, who had recommended that the city remove Turnage, said that the question at hand was not Turnage’s First Amendment rights, but “the reaction and the impact that this speech has had on the residents of Antioch and the confidence and the trust in the government.” Smith noted that because Turnage is an appointed official, not an elected one, it is the responsibility of the city council to hold him accountable.
During the public comment period of the meeting, multiple members of the public expressed concern that Turnage had sullied Antioch’s reputation and had expressed a lack of empathy for the elderly, homeless and mentally ill. One member of the public described Turnage’s worldview as “sociopathic” and “Nazi-like,” especially because his position is responsible for helping to provide seniors with housing.
Others have expressed concern that Turnage is being silenced. Mike Burkholder, publisher of East County Today, defended Turnage in an opinion piece, while acknowledged Turnage is a friend of his.
Turnage did not immediately respond to a request from TIME for comment."

The European Commission president, wearing protective gloves, said EU leaders should learn from the solidarity shown between neighbours.
""If there is something that is more contagious than this virus, it is love and compassion"", von der Leyen said.
""And in the face of adversity, the people of Europe are showing how strong that can be: from luxury perfumers and vodka producers making sanitising gel to carmakers and fashion houses producing masks"".
Votes will take place via email on measures including:
Stopping ghost flights in Europe
An Investment Initiative worth €37 billion
Access to a Solidarity Fund during public health emergencies
The centre-left is calling for bold measures, such as the so-called ""corona bonds"", but the idea of common debt issuance is not gaining traction across the political spectrum.
A new Marshall Plan
""We ask for a new Marshall Plan of for a common investment plan, financed by a common debt instrument that would contemplate the issuing of eurobonds, the activation of the European Stability Mechanism with a specific credit line without additional macroeconomic measures,"" the Spanish MEP Javier Moreno Sanchez, with the Socialists & Democrats.
""Pragmatism first,"" argued Derk Jan Eppink, a Dutch MEP for the ECR party.
""Companies and people urgently need cash. The best way to proceed is to urge national central banks to provide credit at zero interest rate. Bonds go to banks, but we need credit to go straight to citizens and companies"".
This is not the final hurdle: all measures will also need the seal of approval of EU leaders."

The number of people across New York infected with coronavirus was 105, based on state and city tallies Sunday, as residents prepared for a new workweek full of caution about personal contact and staying home if they notice any concerning symptoms.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the new tally was up from 89 Saturday. He renewed his call for the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to approve automated testing for Covid-19—the disease caused by the virus—by private laboratories, including the Northwell Health site he...

The new coronarivus, officially named Covid-19, has killed more than 1,000 people in China and spread to dozens of countries worldwide. The government says necessary precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of the virus in the UK, and the NHS is well prepared to treat new cases. Others argue the country remains vulnerable, and further measures such as school closures and travel restrictions will be needed.

On his return from China last week, Dr. Ian Lipkin quarantined himself in his basement. His wife now puts his food on the stairs. He’s run out of things to watch on Netflix. At odd hours, he walks in New York’s Central Park, keeping 10 feet away from others.
Lipkin is among hundreds of people in the U.S. and thousands around the world who, although not sick, live in semi-voluntary quarantine at home. With attention focused on quarantined cruise ships and evacuees housed on U.S. military bases, those in their own homes have largely escaped notice.
They, too, experts say, play a crucial role in slowing the spread of the new viral disease now called COVID-19.
Most cases and nearly all deaths have been in mainland China. Around the world, authorities are urging two weeks of home quarantine and symptom monitoring for travelers returning from there.
It’s the only tool they have.
“We don’t yet have a vaccine and we don’t have approved drugs for prevention of disease or treatment of disease. So all we have is isolation,” said Lipkin, who directs Columbia University’s Center for Infection and Immunity.
An expert virus hunter, Lipkin was invited by Chinese health authorities to help assess the risk posed by COVID-19. He did similar work in China during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
“This is my second time in the slammer,” said Lipkin, who spent time in quarantine then. He will end his confinement Tuesday, celebrating with a dry martini in public.
The numbers in home quarantine are constantly changing and hard to pin down. New York state, for instance, has received the names of more than 350 who recently returned from mainland China. Local health departments are monitoring them, recommending quarantine for those without known exposure to the virus.
State and U.S. guidelines sort people into high-, medium- and low-risk groups and have advice for each group, but local health departments have discretion in how to carry out the quarantines.
Authorities in Taiwan have fined those who violate quarantines, but so far U.S. officials are relying on people’s sense of responsibility, though they have the power to order a quarantine and get help from police to enforce it. Breaking a quarantine order is a misdemeanor in most states. Violating a federal quarantine order can mean fines and imprisonment.
Some have put themselves in quarantine without an order from health authorities. In Highland, Indiana, Ken and Annie Zurek finished 15 days of self-imposed home quarantine Thursday.
“We grew together as a couple,” Ken Zurek said. “I can’t think of any other person I’d want to spend in quarantine together.” Their confinement began after returning early from a trip to Chongqing, China, to meet their new granddaughter. Ken Zurek, a 63-year-old concrete business owner, had read up on the virus and added a 15th day to their quarantine “because I was a Boy Scout, always trying to be prepared and do the right thing.”
Pat Premick, a 57-year-old executive coach who had been living in China, has been in self-quarantine in the Pittsburgh area since returning to the U.S. early this month. On Friday, she said she has two days left.
To keep busy, she’s been doing puzzles, reading books and talking to friends in China who are going through the same thing. Since there aren’t many people in the area where she’s staying, she takes occasional walks. Friends have been leaving food for her outside, which she fetches after they walk away.
“I’m waving from the window,” she said.
In Seattle, public health workers buy groceries to make sure the people stay comfortable while in home quarantine, bringing one person blueberries, bananas and hair conditioner. Another person confined to a motel room asked for and received an instant teapot to heat soup. The health department workers make sure people have Wi-Fi so they can work and stay connected to family. They arrange calls with counselors for those with anxiety.
Several hundred returning travelers are staying away from others while they monitor their symptoms in Seattle’s King County, where the health department is spending about $200,000 a week on efforts to contain the virus.
“It’s a little bit crazy right now,” said Dr. Meagan Kay, who heads King County’s containment efforts.
In India, health authorities have advised a 28-day home quarantine for returning travelers, much longer than the two-week incubation period accepted elsewhere. In Kerala, a state in the southernmost tip of India with three confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 2,300 people are quarantined at home. They are told to sleep wearing a medical mask and call a helpline if they feel stir crazy.
“It is absolutely boring to be in your room for 28 days,” said Dr. Amar Fetle, who heads the response in Kerala.
In Nordmaling, Sweden, the owners of a Chinese restaurant said they are following health authorities’ guidelines by voluntarily quarantining themselves after a trip to China. They are closing their restaurant until Feb. 27.
“It is to protect ourselves and our customers,” Stanislav Maid told the newspaper Aftonbladet. He runs the restaurant with his wife, Zhou Weixiang. “I have gotten quite a lot of positive reactions from people in the area who think it’s good we take our responsibility.”
In Shanghai, China, home quarantine for journalist Michael Smith of The Australian Financial Review newspaper, began when he returned from a trip to Hong Kong.
“I imagine this is how prison must feel,” Smith said in an email to The Associated Press on Friday, two days into a 14-day confinement. Smith can work at home, but no visitors are allowed and guards are monitoring the only entrance to the housing compound where he lives. He’s finding “an odd comfort” in not worrying about appointments and wearing track pants all day. “I’m treating this as a rare opportunity to read some books, binge watch some Netflix series and get some rest.”
Israel’s Health Ministry on Sunday extended a two-week home quarantine for people arriving from mainland China to include those who have recently spent time in Thailand, Macau, Singapore and Hong Kong.
In New York, Lipkin finds in the COVID-19 outbreak echoes of the movie “Contagion,” for which he was chief science adviser. He has heard the movie has gained new popularity, and he hopes people are learning from it, washing their hands and listening to public health authorities.
He takes his temperature twice a day and reports by email to the medical officer at Columbia, which directed him into home confinement. Unlike others in his situation, he was able to send a swab sample from the back of his nose and throat to his own lab to test for the virus. The result was negative. No virus.
He uses an exercise bike, but most of the time, he works.
“There’s more work than I can possibly do because not only am I running the laboratory at Columbia and writing and dealing with media, but I’m also running programs in China,” he said. “I’m not getting a lot of sleep.”
Lipkin and his wife, Katherine Lewis, are keeping their sense of humor. “My wife is terrific,” he said. “She’ll make dinner for me and leave it on the stairs and say, ‘I’m putting it down here so I don’t have to get your cooties.’
“I hadn’t heard the term ‘cooties’ in probably 50 years.”

It’s one of the most urgent questions in the United States right now: How many people have actually been tested for the coronavirus?
This number would give a sense of how widespread the disease is, and how forceful a response to it the United States is mustering. But for days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has refused to publish such a count, despite public anxiety and criticism from Congress. On Monday, Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, estimated that “by the end of this week, close to a million tests will be able to be performed” in the United States. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence promised that “roughly 1.5 million tests” would be available this week.
But the number of tests performed across the country has fallen far short of those projections, despite extraordinarily high demand, The Atlantic has found.
Read: You’re likely to get the coronavirus
“The CDC got this right with H1N1 and Zika, and produced huge quantities of test kits that went around the country,” Thomas Frieden, the director of the CDC from 2009 to 2017, told us. “I don’t know what went wrong this time.”
Through interviews with dozens of public-health officials and a survey of local data from across the country, The Atlantic could only verify that 1,895 people have been tested for the coronavirus in the United States, about 10 percent of whom have tested positive. And while the American capacity to test for the coronavirus has ramped up significantly over the past few days, local officials can still test only several thousand people a day, not the tens or hundreds of thousands indicated by the White House’s promises."

What’s more deadly — the flu, SARS or the new coronavirus discovered in China?
There are different ways to look at it and even knowledgeable folks sometimes say “deadly” when they may mean “lethal.”
Lethality means the capacity to cause death, or how often a disease proves fatal.
Chinese scientists who looked at nearly 45,000 confirmed cases in the current COVID-19 outbreak concluded the death rate was 2.3%. But there are questions about whether all cases are being counted: Infected people with only mild symptoms may be missing from the tally. That means the true fatality rate may be lower.
Deadly is a broader concept that takes in how far and easily a virus spreads.
SARS proved fatal in about 10% of cases in the 2003 outbreak but was controlled quickly and spread to about 8,000 people in all.
The flu’s mortality rate is 0.1%, yet it kills hundreds of thousands around the world each year because it infects millions. So the size of the outbreak matters as much as the lethality in terms of how deadly a disease is."
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51693259,Coronavirus : First case confirmed in Republic of Ireland,"Coronavirus: First case confirmed in Republic of Ireland
The first case of the coronavirus has been confirmed in the Republic of Ireland.
The patient is a male in the eastern part of the country, according to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.
It said he is currently receiving appropriate medical care.
The case is associated with travel from an affected area in northern Italy, rather than contact with another confirmed case.
The Irish Department of Health would not be drawn on whether the man had been on the same flight as a woman who was diagnosed with Covid-19 in Northern Ireland earlier this week.
Dr Tony Holohan, the Republic's chief medical officer, said: ""This is not unexpected. We have been preparing for this eventuality for many weeks now.
""Public health protocols have been in place since January and are operating effectively.
""The health service is well used to managing infectious diseases and has robust response measures in place.""
The Director of the Republic's Health Protection Surveillance Centre said efforts are under way to identify and locate people who came into contact with the latest victim.
On Saturday night, Dr John Cuddihy said the ""contact tracing process has commenced"" and ""people who need to be notified will be notified"".
He added this work will involve tracing ""all stages of the journey"" made by the man.
It comes two days after the first case of the virus was diagnosed in Northern Ireland.
The woman was in Italy last week and flew to Dublin Airport before travelling to Northern Ireland.
It was confirmed by laboratory tests on Saturday.
Officials have said everyone in close contact with the woman has been notified.
All-island strategy
Earlier on Saturday, Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar and the Republic's health minister Simon Harris held a conference call with political leaders in Northern to discuss how best to contain the virus.
It came as the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, issued guidelines to parishes ""due to the recent concerns surrounding the coronavirus"".
A number of changes to Mass have been advised, including the sign of peace being suspended and holy water fonts not being used.
The Church of Ireland has also issued advisory guidelines to parishes which includes the recommendation that ""physical interaction during services"" should be suspended.
Both churches have said anyone administering Holy Communion must wash their hands and sanitise them with alcohol-based gel and that Communion must be administered into parishioners' hands and not their mouths.
On Monday, Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs advised its citizens not to travel to areas of Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Two days later Ireland's men's and women's Six Nations games against Italy in Dublin on 7 and 8 March were postponed because of coronavirus.
On Saturday, it emerged that Ireland's Six Nations match against France in Paris is under growing threat following the French government's announcement that all ""confined"" gatherings of more than 5,000 people have been cancelled.
Drive-through testing
In Northern Ireland, a ""drive-through"" coronavirus testing centre is in operation at Antrim Area Hospital.
The facility allows patients referred by a GP to be tested in their vehicle.
Antrim Hospital is carrying out tests on patients who are referred by a GP, who must agree a test is required based on travel history and symptoms, as first reported in the Irish News.
On arrival at the hospital staff wearing protective equipment will approach their vehicle and collect necessary swabs through an open window.
The Public Health Agency has confirmed that 93 coronavirus tests have been carried out in Northern Ireland and 92 were negative.
Helpline extended
Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride has been briefed by the his counterpart in the Republic of Ireland, Dr Holohan, on the confirmed case.
NI Health Minister Robin Swann said: ""Positive test results had been anticipated on both sides of the border and we have repeatedly made clear it was a question of when not if.
""I have full confidence in the expertise and commitment of our public health professionals and pay tribute to everyone working hard to contain the spread of this virus and keep us well.""
On Friday, Mr Swann said the NHS 111 advice helpline had replaced the PHA's coronavirus helpline in Northern Ireland.
That meant people in Northern Ireland had access to the ""same level of advice as citizens in England"", he added."

The Hunt for Covid-19 Drugs and Vaccines Becomes Even More Complex
Researchers confront unusual ethical and logistical obstacles, including finding enough study subjects
The fast-evolving coronavirus pandemic is posing unusual challenges in the search for drugs and vaccines, forcing researchers to rework or even scrap clinical trials as the science becomes outdated and lockdowns make study subjects harder to find.
Researchers in China this month had to shut down two studies they had hoped would examine a Gilead Sciences Inc. drug because they couldn’t find enough patients after the virus’s peak had passed. Meanwhile, researchers at Gilead and other places are opting to forgo standard tools...

https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/24/sitges-carnival-coronavirus-and-greta-among-themes-at-spanish-festival,In pictures : Coronavirus and Greta among themes at Sitges Carnival,"Sitges Carnival near Barcelona is known for its weird, wonderful - and topical - costumes, and this year was no different.
Two carnival aficionados - Ulrich Malsch, 56, and Yorlen Perez, 43 - attended the event in medical safety suits amid rising concern over the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
Although some might see making light of a virus that has so far killed several hundred people a little close to the bone, Malsch and Perez, 43, explained that their costumes were meant to be a bit of fun.
""I think that most of all we have got to laugh in the face of adversities because daily life is tough enough,"" Malsch said.
Sitges Carnival is being celebrated this year between 20-26 of February, with 2,200 dancers and musicians parading on 43 floats through the town.
One was a three-metre-high blue elephant surrounded by performers dressed in traditional Indian clothing.
The event costs the municipality €235,000, but the organisers are expecting more than 300,000 people to attend, signifying a huge boost to the local economy.
The COVID-19 outbreak was not the only topic that inspired this year's participants. Euronews correspondent Oliver Miočić spotted a dancer dressed as the climate activist Greta Thunberg.
Sitges is popular with the LGBTQ+ community, and organiser David Martínez explained he wanted the week-long festivity to embrace ""respect and civility without sexist behaviour or homophobia.”
Raul Garcia, 56, who is originally from Cuba, told Euronews: ""Sex doesn’t have genders. The most important thing for me is that people are happy. It’s about the heart.""
And the partying doesn't stop after the parades end, night clubs stay open for wild parties until the early hours of the morning.
By that point, fancy dress costumes and wigs aren't looking as pristine as they did at the start of the night."

Illustration: Aïda Amer/Axios
There's no such thing as being too early. That's the big lesson from the COVID-19 crisis: The risks of overreacting are minuscule compared with the risks of waiting to see how bad things get before you act.
Why it matters: The U.S. is already suffering from waiting too long to prepare itself for the medical emergency.
- And Congress is debating a trillion-dollar fiscal stimulus plan — one that former Minneapolis Fed president Narayana Kocherlakota says should be closer to $2.5 trillion.
- Top of mind for decision-makers should be the risks of not doing enough.
The big picture: The first case of COVID-19 in South Korea surfaced on Jan. 27 — exactly the same day that the first case of COVID-19 was found in the U.S. The Korean response was swift and aggressive; the U.S. response wasn't. The result is that Korea has the pandemic under control, while the U.S. does not.
How it works: The Federal Reserve is a good example of a U.S. agency that has tried to err on the side of doing too much too soon. It slashed interest rates on March 3, two weeks before its scheduled meeting, and then brought them down to zero during the weekend of March 15, along with a passel of other actions copied and pasted from the 2008 financial crisis handbook.
- The Fed even backstopped money market funds on Thursday, despite the fact that they are currently experiencing inflows and need no such backstop. Better safe than sorry.
The bottom line: When Italy quarantined 16 million people on March 8, it felt like an extreme measure. Now that Italy's COVID-19 death toll has surpassed China's, it doesn't look so extreme.
- No one is harmed by doing too much too early.
- The cost of doing too little is measured not only in billions of dollars of economic activity, but also in human lives."
https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/23/coronavirus-people-slammed-as-insensitive-and-arrogant-for-ignoring-social-distancing-plea,Coronavirus : People slammed as  insensitive  and  arrogant  for ignoring social distancing pleas,"Authorities across Europe have been calling on citizens to adhere to social distancing as COVID-19 cases continue to soar.
Neither the UK nor the Republic of Ireland has reached a status of full lockdown. Parks and playgrounds remained open over the weekend, sparking concern among some about a lack of social distancing.
The Dublin Fire Brigade were among those who took to social media showing roads packed with cars north of the capital, calling on people to ""find somewhere else to go"" adding that the virus is spread through person-to-person contact.
Glendalough National Park in Wicklow, Ireland, was closed on Sunday until further notice due to social distancing concerns while Banna Beach in County Kerry was also cleared by authorities.
Irish police have asked people to avoid popular destinations. ""We ask people and families to be responsible, not to attend popular locations and where the numbers of persons starts to increase at any location to leave such areas,"" they said in a statement.
Meanwhile in the United Kingdom, fresh calls have surfaced for stricter social distancing guidelines as people took to national parks in Snowdonia National Park in Wales and elsewhere.
In a statement to Euronews, the Snowdonia National Park Authority (NPA) hailed it ""the busiest visitor weekend in living memory"" while calling on the UK government to ""tighten measures and guidance to ensure that people are not travelling to the countryside to self-isolate"".
""The crowds we saw on Snowdon and around key sites in Snowdonia over the weekend were alarming as it became evident people were not heeding the government’s advice to avoid non-essential journeys and to maintain safe social distancing, therefore we must act quickly to ensure that this issue is addressed,"" Chief Executive of the Snowdonia NPA told Euronews, confirming that they are closing their car parking facilities.
The Cumbria police took to Twitter urging people to avoid non-essential travel, saying that ""despite the government health warnings, people have still travelled in numbers to the Lake District"".
""A national emergency is not an excuse for a public holiday,"" their statement added.
Some lines on the London Underground have also remained busy despite the city's mayor, Sadiq Khan, urging people not to travel unless it is essential.
In the Netherlands, police in Zandvoort stated that crowds were still taking walks along the beach despite directives otherwise.
Authorities have been urging communities to ""avoid crowded areas"" and have closed beaches in both Zandvoort and Bloemendaal saying that they will ""send holidaymakers back"".
""When beaches fill up, it is difficult to maintain a safe distance,"" authorities said in a statement.
Further afield in New York City, the epicentre of the Coronavirus outbreak in the United States, Prospect Park and other places in the city remained busy over the weekend.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo commented on clusters taking to parks: ""It’s insensitive, it’s arrogant, it’s self-destructive, it’s disrespectful to other people and it has to stop"".
How have some nations been enforcing social distancing rules?
Police in Brussels have been using drones to ensure social distancing is being adhered to in parks. On Twitter, police in the capital city confirmed that they were ""carrying out surveillance"" across green spaces throughout the city while broadcasting a ""trilingual message"" through a speaker phone to remind those on the ground to respect health measures in place.
Police in Germany have been using helicopters to monitor social distancing along coast lines.
""The excellent weather is a real temptation for tourists and other visitors,"" Andrea Papenroth, spokesperson for Wilhelmshaven and Friesland police said in a statement.
""However, there is still a strict requirement to do everything possible to slow down the spread of the Corona virus, so the helicopter with its 'bird's eye view' offers a very good opportunity to get an overall impression"".
Police in France have been patrolling on bike, cars, horseback and on motorbikes to check whether citizens have the correct documentation to leave their homes.
Speaking previously with Euronews, Doctor and Radio Presenter, Dr Ciara Kelly, warned against lax social distancing.
""It's not easy for all of us to stay home alone - it's quite challenging. But it is our only defence against a virus that we have no immunity to, that we have no cure for and we have no vaccine for,"" she said."
https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/should-i-avoid-crowds-because-coronavirus/607420/,Who Should Avoid Crowds Because of the Coronavirus ? ,"A surprising number of people with a wide array of health conditions—including diagnoses as common as asthma—should be more cautious than usual. But most Americans shouldn’t necessarily be avoiding crowds and airplanes at this point, experts say. Instead, some risk assessment, both on an individual level and a societal level, is going to be required..
Read: You’re likely to get the coronavirus
Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all Americans avoid nonessential travel to five countries: China, Italy, South Korea, Iran, and Venezuela. Some companies, including Twitter, have suspended all employee travel. But beyond that, there are weddings, conferences, vacations, and funerals to get to by plane. COVID-19 is transmitted through coughing or sneezing, so staying six feet away from people will help minimize the risk that someone else’s cough droplets will land on you. If you’re getting on a plane, however, that won’t be possible. And the closer you’re sitting to a fellow passenger who’s sick, the likelier you are to get COVID-19 from that person.
On a more typical day, the average American city dweller might take a crowded train to a packed, open-plan office, then go to a bustling PTA meeting after work. According to Chu, people who already have a chronic illness or are at risk of getting one should avoid these types of crowds as much as possible. This includes people with cancer, people over the age of 65, and people with respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, or even asthma.
People with asthma are not more likely to catch COVID-19, but theyaremore likely to fare poorly if they do. Asthma and similar health conditions cause the lungs to have trouble exchanging air, a situation that viruses such as the flu and the coronavirus exacerbate by filling the lungs with inflammatory cells, Chu said.
Read: What you can do right now about the coronavirus
There’s no hard cutoff for when a crowd becomes too risky for an asthmatic or elderly person. It’s not that, say, the opera is definitely off-limits but work meetings are guaranteed to be fine. Chu said she recommends that people who have asthma or a lung disease or are otherwise immunocompromised start thinking about telecommuting from work right about now.
For everyone else, decisions depend on what Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, calls personal “risk preference.” That is, how worried are you about catching COVID-19? If you’re relatively young, healthy, and traveling to a place other than the five restricted countries relatively soon, you might decide that the risk of catching the disease is worth whatever it is you’re doing. Adalja told me that he has not canceled any of his public appearances. Two other experts told me that it’s still too premature for healthy people living in areas without a large number of cases to avoid gatherings or otherwise change their plans. Instead, says Henry Wu, the director of the Emory TravelWell Center, in Atlanta, the advice is the same as it has been for the rest of day-to-day life: They should just wash their hands often, cough into the crook of their elbow, and avoid touching their face.
Of course, for some people, staying inside for a few weeks would be easier than going a single day without a good face-touch.

Rep. Matt Gaetz tested negative for the novel coronavirus after entering self-quarantine Monday due to contact with an individual at CPAC who was confirmed to have the illness.
Why it matters: Gaetz was traveling with President Trump on Air Force One about an hour before his office announced that he would go into self-quarantine.
Between the lines: Gaetz received pushback last week for wearing a gas mask on the floor of the House as Congress weighed emergency coronavirus funding. Many viewed the stunt as making light of the situation.
- A citizen in Gaetz's Florida district died from the virus a few days later.
The big picture: Multiple members of Congress have self-quarantined after a CPAC attendee tested positive for COVID-19 last week. CPAC speakers included President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and various members of Congress were in attendance.
- The American Conservative Union said in a statement: ""This attendee had no interaction with the president or the vice president and never attended the events in the main hall.""
- The attendee is currently receiving medical care in New Jersey and under quarantine."

In Northern Ireland, five people were diagnosed with the virus on Sunday, bringing the total number to 12.
Ireland's Health Minister Simon Harris said the coronavirus outbreak is very serious and the situation would ""require not just a whole of government approach, but a whole of society approach"".

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — The new virus has killed two elderly Iranian citizens, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported Wednesday.
IRNA quoted Alireza Vahabzadeh, an adviser to the country’s health minister, as saying that both victims had been carrying the coronavirus and were located in Qom, about 140 kilometers (86 miles) south of the capital Tehran.
The state news agency said later that schools and universities in Qom would be closed so an investigation could take place. No additional details were released.
Earlier on Wednesday, Iranian authorities confirmed two cases of the new virus, the first in the country, according to the semi-official ISNA news agency. Officials later said the two patients had died.
ISNA quoted an official in the country’s health ministry, Kiyanoush Jahanpour, as saying that “since last two days, some suspected cases of the new coronavirus were found.”
The virus causes the illness that the World Health Organization recently named COVID-19, referring to its origin late last year and the coronavirus that causes it.
The new virus emerged in China in December. Since then, more than 75,000 people have been infected globally, with more than 2,000 deaths being reported, mostly in China.
The new virus comes from a large family of what are known as coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a cold. It causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath. It can worsen to pneumonia, which can be fatal.
First detected in China, the virus is believed to have originated in a type of wild animal sold at a Chinese market to be consumed as food.
Iran has applied safety measure on arrival flights at its airports to control a possible spread of the virus.
Elsewhere in the Middle East, nine cases have been confirmed in the United Arab Emirates, seven of them Chinese nationals, one Indian and one Filipino, while Egypt’s Health Ministry confirmed its first case last Friday.
Egypt’s Health Ministry only identified its sole case as a foreigner who is carrying the virus but not showing any serious symptoms. The ministry said the person was hospitalized and in isolation. It did not specify the person’s nationality or what port of entry he or she arrived at in Egypt.
The case in Egypt was also the first on the African continent. Experts and African leaders have expressed concern that should the virus spread there, it might wreak havoc among less developed countries with fewer health resources.

This story has been corrected to show that of the nine cases confirmed in the United Arab Emirates, not all are Chinese; seven are Chinese nationals, one is Indian and one is Filipino."

Here’s a brief look at how these two countries in Russia’s backyard have been faring since the start of the outbreak:
Belarus (17,489 cases, 103 deaths):
— President Alexander Lukashenko, 65, has continued to hold public events and resisted enacting a lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus, dismissing fears of the pandemic as a global “psychosis.” Lukashenko has not been tested for coronavirus himself because, according to his spokesperson, “there’s no need for that.”
— He has vehemently opposed closing parts of the economy to slow coronavirus, citing a potentially painful recovery for the nation of more than 9 million. Still, the country’s schools and businesses have started to voluntarily close without waiting for Lukashenko’s orders.
— Lukashenko has maintained that none of Belarus’ Covid-19 deaths had been from the disease itself but from other accompanying ailments, including cancer and obesity. In mid-April, the leader who has touted vodka, the sauna and tractors as anti-Covid therapies asserted that “no one will die of coronavirus in our country. I publicly declare this.”
— Lukashenko vowed to hold a military parade in Minsk marking 75 years since the Soviet victory in World War II, and on Tuesday invited fellow heads of post-Soviet states to attend it. Russia postponed its May 9 parade on Red Square to later in 2020 due to the outbreak.
— During Orthodox Easter in April, Lukashenko defiantly attended church service and criticized other countries for trying to enforce stay-home measures. The leaders of other countries with large Orthodox Christian populations did not attend Easter services, with many churches moving them online.
Turkmenistan (0 cases, 0 deaths):
— Gas-rich and secretive Turkmenistan has closed its borders, suspended international travel and restricted domestic travel in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. Though officially coronavirus-free, uncorroborated reports have claimed that at least seven people have tested positive in a single city as of April 14.
— Around 400 people quarantined in Turkmenistan's second-largest city were allegedly moved to small provincial clinics and a psychiatric ward ahead of a World Health Organization (WHO) team's visit, the U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty news outlet reported in late April.
— Turkmen leader Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov has led a series of public events in the midst of the pandemic, including an April 25-26 Horse Day competition attended by thousands of spectators. He has also urged Turkmens to burn a traditional herb and practice the “principles of healthy living” to ward off the virus.
— Without state-imposed lockdown measures, Turkmens like Belarussians are reportedly taking matters into their own hands by limiting contacts, refusing to shake hands and not attending mass gatherings in some cities.
— Berdymukhamedov has also vowed to hold a military parade marking the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory in World War II. Unlike several other ex-Soviet countries, Turkmenistan has not previously held parades on May 9.
— Fellow Central Asian state Tajikistan also reported no cases until last Thursday when it said 15 people had tested positive. By Monday, Tajikistan acknowledged at least 230 cases of Covid-19.

US and Finnish passengers at Helsinki Airport were confused and frustrated by President Trump's 30-day travel ban.
The consequences of US President Donald Trump's 30-day travel ban from Europe to the US in a bid to prevent further spread of novel coronavirus is causing confusion at Helsinki Airport.
The ban, which was announced on Wednesday evening, steps into place on Friday at midnight and affects travelers who were planning to fly from Finland to the US between 13 March and 14 April.
Johanna and Timo Kossi from Harjavalta, a town and municipality in Western Finland, expressed their dismay at the situation on Thursday at Helsinki Airport where they had planned to board a flight to New York.
""I don't want to swear, but I'm very irritated,"" Johanna Kossi said.
The couple had already checked in their luggage when they received a message from their tour operator telling them that the trip was cancelled. But the flight to New York on which they were booked wasn't actually cancelled. The Kossis told Yle that they were left confused and unsure of what to do, especially if their accommodations and return flight to Finland were to also be cancelled.
They had booked their trip to New York to celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary six months ago from charter company Finnair Holidays.
Another Finnish traveler, Mari Hänninen from Espoo, was also left pondering whether or not she should head to New York on Finnair's Thursday flight with her friends as they were concerned about how they would get back to home after their trip. In the end, the group of friends decided to get on the plane.
The corona virus is not a reason to avoid travel, Hänninen told Yle.
""I can also catch the corona virus in Finland, and I wash my hands carefully,"" she said.
American travelers at the airport also told Yle that they had decided to return home earlier than planned because of the travel ban.
Rohit Raju had been visiting Finland to spend time with the person he's dating. The couple would have spent four more days together in Finland together if the ban hadn't been set in place.
Tillman Lewis was flying from Helsinki to Miami and then home to Birmingham, Alabama. His original plan was to leave Finland on Friday via Amsterdam, but he changed his travel plans owing to the new travel restrictions.
""I want to ensure that I get home,"" Lewis told Yle.
Meanwhile, Finnair, the Finnish national airline, announced Thursday afternoon it is cancelling all flights to the US between 19 March and 12 April due to the US government’s travel restrictions."

Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014, banned all hotels and guest houses from hosting tourists without negative Covid-19 test results until June 1. Still, regional authorities noted a nearly 40% uptick in Friday’s vehicle traffic into Crimea from Russia.
“I never thought that I’d make this plea to fellow citizens, but there’s no other way: I strongly ask all our citizens to refrain from coming to Crimea, both for business and leisure,” Crimean leader Sergei Aksyonov said.
“All Crimean sanatoriums and vacation spots are closed,” Aksyonov said in a video address posted on his social media accounts.

On Saturday, Aksyonov threatened to fine visitors who violate two-week self-isolation orders by up to 30,000 rubles ($380).
“Starting next week, we’re checking everyone who filled out questionnaires,” he said, referring to a form the health watchdog hands out to every visitor asking them to provide information about where they’re staying in Crimea.
Authorities said most of the new arrivals came via the Crimean bridge, which President Vladimir Putin opened last year to cement Moscow’s hold on the disputed territory. Crimea’s air traffic has fallen by an estimated three-quarters and rail traffic five-fold during the pandemic.
Crimea, like many other regions in Russia, has imposed strict lockdown rules until April 30 to slow the spread of Covid-19.
Crimea had reported 62 coronavirus cases as of Monday. Russia had reported a total of 47,121 coronavirus cases — 10th in the world — and 405 deaths as of Monday."
https://www.dw.com/en/will-warmer-weather-stop-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus/a-52570290,Will warmer weather stop the spread of the coronavirus ? | Science| In - depth reporting on science and technology | DW,"Does the coronavirus get weaker when temperatures rise? Virologist Thomas Pietschmann explains why spring really gives hope and why women have a clear advantage in the fight against the COVID-19 disease.
Could warmer weather slow the spread of the coronavirus? If all goes well, the new virus SARS-CoV-2, may behave like the influenza virus. Then spring, with its rising temperatures, would kill the pathogens - and stop the spread of the COVID-19 disease. The coronavirus season would pass away just like the annual flu wave, which starts to ebb when winter ends.
Spring may be the season of hope, but it's still too early to say accurately whether SARS-CoV-2 behaves as the influenza virus. Virologist Thomas Pietschmann says, experts can't yet predict the trajectory of the virus because ""honestly speaking, we do not know the virus yet.""
Pietschmann is a molecular virologist at the Center for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, called Twincore, in Hanover, Germany. He researches so-called RNA viruses, including for example the hepatitis C virus. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to this group.
Virus? Unknown!
""What's special about this virus is that humans are confronted with it for the first time. From the data we have from China, we can conclude that the virus has only once passed from an animal to humans and spread from there,"" says Pietschmann.
Unlike influenza viruses, which nearly everyone has been in contact with at some point, our immune system is not prepared for an attack with corona pathogens.
In addition, the external conditions in the northern hemisphere are currently virtually perfect for the rapid spread of the virus. For one thing, there's the temperature. Respiratory viruses, i.e. those that spread via the respiratory tract, have a particularly easy time when the weather is cool. ""Viruses have greater stability at low temperatures. This is similar to food that keeps longest in the refrigerator,"" says Pietschmann.
Cool and dry, please!
The warmer it gets, the more difficult the conditions are for many viruses. ""The coronavirus is surrounded by a lipid layer, in other words, a layer of fat,"" Pietschmann explains. This layer is not very heat-resistant, which means that the virus quickly breaks down when temperatures rise. ""Other viruses, such as the norovirus, are more stable because they consist mainly of proteins and genetic material.""
Read more: Why coronavirus fears are disproportionate compared with other health risks
For other pathogens, temperature only plays a subordinate role. The dengue virus, for example, is mainly found in tropical and subtropical regions. But this has less to do with the pathogens liking warm weather: ""In this case, it is not the temperature that plays the main role in the spread of the pathogens, but the animal that transmits the virus,"" Pietschmann says.
Air humidity also influences the transmissibility of respiratory viruses. Once the pathogens have been expelled from the respiratory tract with a strong sneeze, they literally hang in the air. ""On cold and usually dry winter days, the small droplets, together with the viruses, float in the air longer than when the air humidity is high,"" Pietschmann elaborates.
In this way, the pathogens can spread rapidly. However, at first they do this quietly and secretly. From the first contact with the pathogens to the first symptoms of the disease, several weeks can pass. The length of this incubation period depends on the characteristics and biology of the virus.
Double X chromosome and estrogen
Fever, pain and chills are typical symptoms of a viral disease and a sign that the body is fighting off the invaders. How successful this fight is depends not only on the age and health of the infected person, but on his or her gender. In the case of the coronavirus, the data shows that women have higher survival chances than men. At 2.8%, the mortality rate of men is significantly higher than that of women, at 1.7%.
According to Pietschmann, this difference can be explained by genetics. ""Some immune-relevant genes, for example genes that are responsible for recognizing pathogens, are encoded on the X chromosome. Because women have two X chromosomes and men have only one, the female sex has an advantage here.""
Read more: Corona-phobia: Like SARS, coronavirus fear feeds racism
The female sex hormone estrogen also helps women fend of viral diseases. ""Some immune-relevant genes also have binding sites for estrogens, where these genes are switched on. This means that these genes are also controlled by the hormones,"" says Pietschmann.
Perhaps the corona season will indeed end with the beginning of spring in the northern hemisphere. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), however, there are more than 20 cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Australia and one case in Brazil — in the southern hemisphere. Where winter is yet to come.
People around the world are strapping on breathing masks to prevent a viral infection. Other measures are more effective, though. Here are some tips based on WHO guidelines. (23.01.2020)

https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/14/german-economy-stagnates-as-eurozone-growth-reaches-7-year-low,German economy stagnates as eurozone growth reaches 7 - year low,"Europe's largest economy stalled at the end of 2019, as German manufacturing remained in a slump and exports fell.
The country recorded a zero growth between October and December, amid headwinds caused by the US-China trade dispute and Britain's departure from the European Union.
Both Germany and the wider Eurozone have reached their weakest point since 2013, when the entire region was suffering from a debt crisis that threatened to upturn the euro currency.
Figures from Germany's federal statistics agency Destatis showed there was zero growth in fourth quarter GDP. On an annual bases, the German economy grew by only 0.6% during 2019 — 0.9% less than in 2018.
Germany's troubles are a central problem for the 19-nation eurozone and the European Central Bank, which is trying to stimulate flagging growth and inflation with negative interest rates and bond purchases with newly printed money.
Electric cars and smartphone apps
Germany has been a manufacturing and export champion in recent years but those areas have been sluggish. Consumer spending and services businesses have held up better and kept the country out of recession.
Slowing global trade and the uncertainty caused by the US-China trade war have been one headwind, as businesses wonder if new tariffs or import taxes will alter or disrupt their supply chains of raw materials and parts.
Another factor causing the stagnation is linked to structural change in the industry, particularly the auto business: companies must now invest billions into developing electric cars and new services based on smartphone apps, both to meet regulatory pressure for lower greenhouse gas emissions and to head off competition from new entrants from the tech industry.
Germany and the eurozone also face the possibility of disrupted trade with Britain, which left the European Union on January 31.
Negotiators must work out a trade deal by the end of the year to avoid new tariffs and barriers to products, and time is short to reach agreement on the complex issues involved.
And on top of all that come worries about the spread of the COVID-2019 coronavirus outbreak.
Coronavirus
“The effect of coronavirus on global supply chains is likely to keep eurozone and German growth subdued in the short term,” said Rosie Colthorpe, European economist at Oxford Economics.
The three biggest economies in Europe all stalled or shrank in the last three months of the year: France saw output contract, albeit by a modest 0.1% while heavily indebted Italy shrank 0.3%.
Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, said recent hopes for a modest upswing were looking a little premature at this point.
“In general, the German economy remains stuck between solid private consumption and a paralyzed manufacturing sector,'' he wrote in a note."
https://time.com/magazine/europe/,"Europe , Middle East , and Africa","The U.S. urgently needs to restart, but no economy can function if an infectious disease like COVID-19 continues to sicken the work-force
There is both promise and peril in being a pioneer, and the people of Hokkaido have learned both lessons well over the past few months. After infections of COVID-19 on the Japanese island exploded following its annual winter festival this year, officials in February declared a state of emergency to control the disease. Soon after, new daily cases plummeted, and Hokkaido’s quick action was heralded as a beacon for the rest of Japan to follow.
But it wasn’t just infections that dropped; over the next month, agriculture and tourism business also dried up, and Hokkaido’s governor decided to ease social restrictions. However, compliance with limits on social interaction after weeks of sequestering was harder this time around. Within a month, Hokkaido’s new COVID-19 infections jumped by 80%, and the governor had to reinstate lockdown policies.
There are similar stories from Singapore, Hong Kong and Germany, and all serve as sobering lessons for the decision-makers in the U.S. who are under increasing pressure to reopen the country to reactivate its stalled economy. The tension is built into the pandemic: while public-health metrics all point toward extended social isolation and a more gradual reopening of society, the decisions are made by politicians. Already, some state governors are allowing businesses such as nail salons, barbershops and gyms to reopen to prevent bankruptcies and economic ruin.
How to proceed? The U.S. urgently needs to restart, but no economy can function if an infectious disease like COVID-19 continues to sicken the workforce and keep customers to a trickle. More than a million Americans have had the disease, but it is not yet known whether recovering can provide lasting, or any, immunity. Which means much of the country’s nearly 330 million people remain at risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the illness, in a too-sudden return to normal. “Even in the hardest-hit places [in the U.S.], fewer than 1 in 10 people have been infected. So not only could COVID-19 come roaring back, but it could get five times or close to 10 times worse than it is now,” says Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives and former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “The only way forward is to suppress cases and clusters of cases rapidly.”
Under President Trump’s guidelines for Opening Up America Again, states would move through three phases of gradually loosening social restrictions. The threshold for entering each stage toward normality is declines in the number of new COVID-19 cases in the previous 14 days. Gyms, movie theaters and sports stadiums would be the first to reopen, although people would have to remain 6 ft. from one another and avoid intimate gatherings of more than 10. Next, schools and bars could reopen with limitations, and finally, if cases continued to decline, most people could return to work. Health experts warn, however, that the return to normality can’t be only a straight progression–if cases start to inch upward, then social distancing and shelter-in-place directives will have to be renewed.
The only way to calibrate those decisions is to know where the new infections are. When it comes to conquering an infectious disease, the adage “know your enemy” is remarkably apt. Or, even more important, know where your enemy is. Tracking an invisible virus is the key to controlling it, and the quickest and most reliable strategy for that is to build a robust system to test anyone who might be infected. For the U.S. to reopen its economy, “We’re going to have to find those people who are infected, and not just wait for them to come to us,” says Barry Bloom, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “The bottom line is, it’s testing, testing, testing–so we know where the epidemic is before we can relax any stringencies in a stepwise fashion.”
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, tells TIME, “We must have in place the capability that when we do start to see cases come back–and I’ll guarantee you that they will–to identify by testing, [and then] isolate and contact-trace to get people out of circulation who are infected.”
It may take tens of millions of tests per week to do that, and the problem is the U.S.’s testing capacity may not be ready yet. “There is absolutely no way on earth, on this planet or any other planet, that we can do 20 million tests a day, or even 5 million tests a day,” says Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health who is overseeing the government’s testing response.
1. TESTING
Widespread testing can yank away the curtain that hides SARS-CoV-2, revealing where there are clusters of people who are infected by the virus but not showing symptoms, and thus aren’t aware they might be spreading it to others. That, in turn, will lead to more targeted efforts to isolate anyone who is infectious. And, if all the people who came in contact with an infected person were also tested, it would help local health authorities trace how the virus is moving through a community. It’s basic, boots-on-the-ground disease control.
The U.S., however, stumbled on testing in the early days of the pandemic, and those failures led to a dramatic surge in cases that climbed more quickly than in other countries. Thanks to a combination of contamination issues that delayed the original test from the CDC, and regulatory requirements that prevented commercial and academic labs from immediately developing their own assays, “It’s still the case that testing isn’t nearly as readily available as it needs to be,” says Frieden. As of this writing, just over 1 million tests for COVID-19 are performed in the U.S. each week, which is woefully inadequate, Fauci says.
Public-health experts estimate that the current U.S. testing rate has to triple simply to include all the people who are considered highest priority for testing, including health care workers and nursing-home residents. To fold in all of those who should be tested if gyms and restaurants reopen, the number of daily tests has to increase by tens of millions. Ideally, anyone with symptoms like a cough, fever or shortness of breath should be tested, as should anyone who is sick and living in a group facility like a dormitory, along with any patient admitted to a hospital for any reason. Family members and others with close contact to someone who tests positive should also be tested.
Boosting testing volume is about not just manufacturing more tests but also ensuring that they’re relatively easy to take. So at-home testing kits that are just becoming available–which still require a doctor’s prescription but won’t require people to go to a doctor’s office or health facility to provide a sample–will become more critical as states gradually reopen. Several companies are also offering COVID-19 tests, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that don’t require doctors or patients to sample from deep in the back of the nose and throat, but instead swab the inside of the nostrils or provide a small amount of saliva, making it easier even for non–health professionals to provide samples.
While testing capacity in the U.S. is gaining ground, the road ahead remains long. The health system has never had to manage testing at the scale needed to control this pandemic, and doing so may require equally unprecedented solutions. Anticipating that the gap between testing need and testing capacity will only yawn wider as states reopen, the Rockefeller Foundation, for example, has proposed a coordinated regional command system for testing that would track and redirect supplies to where they are needed. The foundation’s action plan, backed by a $15 million initial investment, also calls for engaging hundreds, even thousands, of smaller labs that currently don’t perform tests for the public. So far, leaders from California and five U.S. cities are working to implement the plan and increase access to testing. (The foundation sponsored a recent TIME 100 Talk.)
2. TRACKING
Once testing at scale is in place, local trends should dictate when and how a particular region might begin to emerge from self-isolation. Loosening of social-distancing policies won’t happen universally across the nation, since the burden of disease is vastly different from New York to Nevada. Each region–whether defined as a community, a state or a group of states–will have to make customized decisions about releasing its residents in phases based on its specific disease trajectory as well as its population density, among other factors.
There are, however, some universal benchmarks. Bloom and others believe new daily cases, identified by wide-scale testing, would have to fall consistently in a given region for at least two weeks before leaders can start discussing reopening businesses and schools. At that point, health experts would investigate where the new cases are. If they’re confined to local and sporadic clusters, that’s a sign that the virus’s circle of transmission is limited and potentially shrinking.
Such scenarios would mean not that the virus is necessarily going away, but that the local health system is in a decent position to manage the load of people who get infected. “We are not just staying home in the magical belief that the virus is going to go away,” says Frieden. “We are staying home so we can strengthen the health care and public-health systems.” The idea isn’t to eradicate coronavirus completely–at least not yet–but to bring its spread to manageable levels. As flare-ups occur, they can be doused with another critical contagion-fighting public-health technique: contact tracing. It doesn’t help to know who is infected if you’re not also investigating who else that person might have infected. In a study conducted in Shenzhen, China, researchers found that tracing contacts of people who tested positive helped reduce the time it took to isolate those who were infectious by nearly half.
This is the foundation of infectious-disease containment, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. Google and Apple are collaborating on a digital solution to contact-trace at scale using smartphone and search data, but concerns about privacy remain. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo has formed a partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the nonprofit Vital Strategies to build a first-of-its-kind training program to teach and certify contact tracers. The program will rely on call centers, digital technology and historical best practices to identify the contacts of people who are infected, track their whereabouts and the contacts of those contacts–and then educate those who need to self-isolate about how best to do that to protect the public’s health.
3. IMMUNIZING
Testing, isolation and contact tracing, however, are all essentially a backup plan for fighting an infectious virus like SARS-CoV-2. The only way to ensure that the virus won’t burn through a global population again is to build a better defense. And the most impenetrable fortress against a virus is immunity, gained–at the individual level–either by becoming infected and recovering or by getting vaccinated. “It doesn’t matter how much virus is out there, if people aren’t susceptible to getting it, then the virus will go away,” says Lisa Lee, associate vice president for research and innovation at Virginia Tech. Smallpox, for example, was eradicated thanks to immunization.
The goal is herd immunity: when nearly every person around the world develops these protections, the “herd” is able to protect the few, such as newborns, who aren’t protected or cannot be vaccinated. At this point, it is unclear if the human body naturally develops any after recovering from COVID-19. So as researchers work to figure that out, they are also racing to develop a vaccine. But although there are a variety of vaccine candidates in development and testing, it will likely take at least 12 months before the first people can be inoculated against SARS-CoV-2.
Without widespread immunity, public-health officials can only keep a close watch on new cases as they pop up, and suppress them so they don’t morph into widespread outbreaks. Which means that until the population at large is protected, some amount of social distancing will become a routine part of our lives. Even if a region shows all the right numbers–declining curves of new COVID-19 cases, fewer deaths and more hospital discharges than admissions–that doesn’t mean restaurants, sports arenas, shopping centers and workplaces should go back to the status quo. “Locking down isn’t just to lock down,” says Fauci. “It’s to give you time so that when you open up again, you can come out swinging … when the virus rears its head, you have the capability to identify, isolate and contact-trace and snuff it down before [cases turn into] outbreaks.”
4. THE NEW NORMAL
Especially in hard-hit, densely populated areas like New York City, at minimum, everyone might need to wear face masks in public to prevent the spread of virus-containing respiratory particles; public-transit riders may not be sitting shoulder to shoulder; diners at restaurants might need to be seated 6 ft. apart; and we might significantly cut back on physical contact. “This may turn out to be the death of the handshake,” says Dr. Hilary Babcock, an infectious-disease specialist at Washington University School of Medicine.
Accepting these changes to daily life is accepting the reality that emerging from this pandemic won’t be like flipping a switch. “This is a public-health emergency, and only public health is going to get us out of this,” says Frieden. “The economy, and society, depend on public health getting this right.” And that means not just testing and identifying people who are infected, along with their contacts, but rethinking how self-isolation fits into broader policy decisions. The massive quarantine of these past few months was unprecedented, but more limited isolation, on a case-by-case or family-by-family basis, may become the norm for at least a while. And public-health officials may have to work with local community leaders to accommodate more formal, structured ways to self-isolate in order to effectively balance the public good of such measures with the rights and dignity of individuals. For example, Frieden says, “we should be offering voluntary isolation for every person infected,” in the form of designated hotels or living quarters to support people who cannot stay in their current homes without putting others at risk.
These, of course, won’t be the only new ubiquities in a post-COVID-19 world. Microbial threats like coronaviruses will inevitably move from the bottom to the top of public-health priority lists, and the dangers of infectious diseases will loom larger in our collective conscious. They will have to, if we have any hope of avoiding further drastic lockdowns and forever changing the way we interact with each other.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51628484,Coronavirus : Rouhani urges Iranians not to panic over outbreak,"Coronavirus: Iran's deputy health minister tests positive as outbreak worsens
Iran's deputy health minister and an MP have both tested positive for the new coronavirus, as it struggles to contain an outbreak that has killed 15.
The country is one of three hot-spots outside China causing concern that the virus could be becoming a pandemic.
The deputy minister, Iraj Harirchi, on Monday denied covering up the scale of the outbreak. He appeared in physical discomfort as he spoke to reporters.
Iran has reported 95 cases, but the actual number is thought to be higher.
The director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said the sudden increase in cases in countries outside China is ""deeply concerning"".
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that Washington was concerned that Iran may have concealed ""vital details"" about its outbreak and urged all nations to ""tell the truth about the coronavirus"".
- All Tuesday's coronavirus developments
- What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms?
More people have died in Iran from the virus than anywhere else outside China. The two countries have strong trading links.
The other countries currently in the spotlight are South Korea and Italy, where cases have surged in recent days.
More than 80,000 cases of the Covid-19 respiratory disease have been reported worldwide since it emerged late last year. About 2,700 patients have died - the vast majority in China.
But the situation in Iran - home to holy sites that attract millions every year and in a region where several countries have weak health systems - has caused great concern about a potential mass outbreak in the Middle East.
- New coronavirus advice for Britons back from Italy
- Mission Impossible halts filming over health fears
- Italian sport disrupted by coronavirus
Of the current hot-spots outside China, Iran is the most concerning because of the lack of an accurate picture of how widespread the outbreak really is, said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, an expert in infectious diseases at King's College London.
Most of the reported cases have been people who are elderly and dying, she said. ""It seems like we're hearing about the tip of the iceberg and missing that chunk underneath who may be younger and may not be particularly unwell.""
What's happening with the virus globally?
- A hotel in Tenerife, in Spain's Canary Islands, is in lockdown after a doctor from Italy visiting the hotel tested positive for the virus
- Italy - Europe's worst-affected country - confirmed the deaths of four more elderly people, bringing the total number of fatalities there to 11
- The virus has spread to the regions of Tuscany, Sicily and Liguria but Italy's PM said his country remained safe for tourism
- Several countries - Austria, Croatia, Switzerland, Algeria - reported their first cases, all involving people who had been to Italy
- While Italy's European neighbours have agreed to keep borders open, some are screening arriving travellers
- US health authorities warned Americans to brace for the coronavirus to spread and potentially cause severe disruption
In Iran, a conflict between religion and science
By Rana Rahimpour, BBC Persian
The reports that we are receiving from cities around Iran suggest that the number of cases is actually much higher than the Iranian authorities are giving.
Unlike in Italy, Iranian officials are refusing to impose quarantines in areas affected by the outbreak. They say quarantines are old-fashioned and that they do not believe in them.
The Shia shrines in the cities of Qom and Mashhad are still open, despite Qom being a hotbed of the virus.
There are grand ayatollahs in Qom who believe that its shrine, which attracts millions of pilgrims from around the world, and its important seminary, which hosts many foreign religious students, are the pride of the Shia world.
Shutting them down would be a huge step for the clerics and not one that they would be likely to take unless they come under international pressure.
We can see the clear conflict between religious conservatism and science.
Iran also lacks the medical equipment it needs to help contain the outbreak. It has run out of masks and does not have enough testing kits.
A number of medical workers have also been infected, so there is a worry that they will soon run out of doctors and nurses to attend to those with the disease.
The majority of Iranians are extremely worried.
What happened to the Iranian official?
""I had a fever as of last night and my preliminary test was positive around midnight,"" Mr Harirchi said in a video released on Tuesday.
""I've isolated myself in a place since... and now I am starting medication.
""We will definitely be victorious against this virus in the next few weeks,"" the minister added.
Mr Harirchi's positive test for Covid-19 was announced a day after he took part in a news conference, where he coughed occasionally and appeared to sweat heavily.
During the briefing, the minister denied a claim by a member of parliament for Qom - the centre of the outbreak - that the authorities were engaged in a cover-up.
Ahmad Amirabadi-Farahani alleged that Covid-19 had arrived in Qom three weeks ago and that 50 people had died in the city alone.
The death toll was rejected by Mr Harirchi, who vowed to resign if it could be proven that even half that number had died.
Mr Amirabadi-Farahani subsequently refused to retract his claim, saying he had sent a list of 40 people who had died to the minister and awaited his resignation.

The secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran Ali Shamkhani, said on Tuesday that he had asked the prosecutor-general to ""check the validity"" of the MP's allegation.
Meanwhile, an MP from the Iranian capital Tehran, Mahmoud Sadeghi, said he had also tested positive for the virus
Could cases spread through the Middle East?
Iran is believed to have been the source of the first cases reported by neighbouring Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman, which have now imposed restrictions on travel to and from the Islamic Republic.
However there are fears that the many Muslim Shia pilgrims and migrant workers who will have travelled between Iran and other parts of the region in recent weeks could have already spread the virus.
In countries like war-ravaged Afghanistan - which has so far reported just one case - health authorities will struggle to trace and test contacts of infected people, experts say.
The WHO is sending medical supplies and additional testing kits to Iran and is also planning to send a technical team to the country.
The United Arab Emirates - a major international transit hub, and home to the airline Emirates - has suspended all passenger and cargo flights to Iran for a week ""as a precautionary measure"". The UAE has reported 13 cases, including an Iranian couple.
Bahrain's health ministry meanwhile raised its number of confirmed cases to 17. It said all of those infected had travelled from Iran via the UAE."

https://apnews.com/61f161a24a728fa675a8eb7d6ca08f62,AP FACT CHECK : Trump baseless theories on coronavirus,"AP FACT CHECK: Trump’s errant virus theories, testing boast
WASHINGTON (AP) — Lysol is for toilet bowls and countertops, not human consumption. The company that manufacturers it felt compelled to emphasize the danger of ingesting it after President Donald Trump’s musings about heat, light and disinfectant in the time of coronavirus.
Trump’s thinking-out-loud theories took a turn toward hazmat territory this past week when he said it would be interesting to see whether people’s innards could get “almost a cleaning” from disinfectants. Doctors tweeted their alarm, worried that people will take Trump’s comment as a cue and swallow chemicals that will harm or kill them.
Trump also gave weight through his bully pulpit to an unproved theory that heat and humidity might hasten the destruction of the coronavirus, suggesting people could be safer around each other in the outdoors.
Research pointing to that possibility is preliminary, other research has found otherwise, and this pandemic has spread in the tropics and Southeast Asia as well as through the northern hemisphere.
Trump followed up Saturday with a baseless boast about testing.
Meantime, Trump’s veterans affairs secretary went even farther than the president in talking up potential benefits of a malaria drug against COVID-19. It’s an area of speculation that his own agency says “displays a dangerous lack of expertise” by amateurs.
A review:
DISINFECTANT
TRUMP, on the virus: “I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that ... you’re going to have to use medical doctors ... but it sounds -- it sounds interesting to me.” — briefing Thursday.
THE FACTS: No.
The fact Trump would even flirt with the idea prompted a statement from Reckitt Benckiser, parent company of the maker of Lysol and Dettol, that “under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).”
Clorox echoed that bleach and other disinfectants “are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.”
The U.S. surgeon general’s office moved to discourage people from thinking they can self-medicate from something in the house: “PLEASE always talk to your health provider first before administering any treatment/medication to yourself or a loved one.”
As the blowback unfolded, Trump said Friday he was being sarcastic the day before.
___
SUNLIGHT & HEAT
TRUMP, on an unproved theory that sunlight, heat and humidity can destroy the virus faster than inside the house: “I hope people enjoy the sun. And if it has an impact, that’s great. ... And if heat is good, and if sunlight is good, that’s a great thing as far as I’m concerned.”
THE FACTS: Sunlight may be a disinfectant for the spirit and outdoor exercise is recommended in today’s social isolation, but there’s no proof it will make the pandemic go away. Without declaring that it would, Trump is again giving traction to a theory that could prompt people to let down their guard around others outside.
Wlliam Bryan, who leads the Homeland Security Department’s science and technology directorate, told the briefing about incomplete, “emerging results” from research that suggest solar light, heat and humidity might be effective at neutralizing the virus. Past studies have not found good evidence of that.
Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s emergencies chief, said in March that “it’s a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza.” Trump said early in the outbreak he expected it to end with the warmer weather of April.
___
TESTING
TRUMP: “We have now Tested more than 5 Million People. That is more than any other country in the World, and even more than all major countries combined!” — tweet Saturday.
THE FACTS: Actually, the U.S. has tested far fewer people than “major countries combined” and lags dozens of countries in testing its population proportionally.
Together, just three major countries -- Russia, Germany and Italy -- have tested about 6.5 million people, compared with over 5 million in the U.S. And the United States is easily outdistanced when testing in other Group of Seven countries is added to the mix, as well as powers such as India. Moreover, the count does not include China, which has more than four times the population of the U.S. but has not published national testing numbers.
More than 30 other countries have tested a larger share of the population than has been done in the U.S., which was slow to make COVID-19 diagnoses available and still can’t offer it to everyone who might be infected.
___
ROUND 2
TRUMP, on the chances of the virus returning in the fall: “If it does come back — it’s not going to come back — and I’ve spoken to 10 different people, it’s not going to be like it was. ... If we have embers of corona coupled with the flu, that’s not going to be pleasant, but it’s not going to be what we’ve gone through in any way, shape, or form. ... You may not even have corona coming back, just so you understand.” — briefing Wednesday.
THE FACTS: His public health officials refuted his statement on the spot that the coronavirus won’t be coming back. As for his statement that it won’t be as bad in a second round, that’s more complicated.
“There will be coronavirus in the fall,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said at the briefing. “I am convinced of that because of the degree of transmissibility that it has, the global nature.”
“Next fall and winter, we’re going to have two viruses circulating, and we’re going to have to distinguish between which is flu and which is the coronavirus,” said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
How bad that will be will be determined by a range of factors that can’t be predicted with precision. Redfield said the situation may be more difficult than now because the coronavirus and the flu will be circulating at the same time, unlike during the bulk of the current pandemic. Or it may be less difficult if preparations and containment are better than now.

MALARIA DRUG
VA SECRETARY ROBERT WILKIE, asked whether it’s safe to encourage people to take hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment: “Oh, I think so.” — interview Wednesday on MSNBC.
THE FACTS: That’s not what the government’s top health experts have said for weeks, nor what his own agency has suggested. A new alert Friday from the Food and Drug Administration further underscored why the drug cannot be considered generally safe in this pandemic and why it has not been approved by the FDA for treatment of COVID-19.
Last month, the FDA authorized the narrow emergency use of the malaria drugs for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who aren’t enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. But regulators said they are investigating life-threatening side effects reported to poison control centers and other health authorities.
In one such report, doctors at a New York hospital said that heart rhythm abnormalities developed in most of the 84 coronavirus patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin, a combination Trump has promoted as part of his persistent and inaccurate portrayal of the malaria drug as a game-changer.
The drug has long been used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. A few, very small preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent the coronavirus from entering cells and possibly help patients clear the virus sooner.
Wilkie, as VA secretary, leads the nation’s largest health system. His agency’s own health care arm has criticized premature assessments on the effectiveness of the drug for the coronavirus. In an unsigned response to an audit report last month examining whether the VA had adequate stocks of the drug, top VA health officials called it “inaccurate and irresponsible” to assume hydroxychloroquine would benefit veterans for COVID-19.
“There are active investigations into these drugs and many others, as discussed by Dr. Anthony Fauci,” according to the unsigned VA response to the agency’s inspector general. “Yet no conclusions have been made on their effectiveness. To insist that a 14 days’ supply of these drugs is appropriate or not appropriate displays this dangerous lack of expertise on COVID-19 and Pandemic response.”
___
WILKIE, on a nationwide study finding that a malaria drug had no benefit for treating COVID-19 among veterans: “That’s an observational study. It’s not a clinical study. It was done on a small number of veterans. Sadly, those of whom were in the last stages of life. And the drug was given to them. And I have to also say that the drug — we know the drug has been working on middle-age and younger veterans ... working in stopping the progression of the disease.” — interview Wednesday on MSNBC.
THE FACTS: He mischaracterized the study’s finding.
Wilkie rejected a study that relies on his department’s own hospital data and finds no benefit from hydroxychloroquine. His claim that it helps younger or middle-aged veterans with COVID-19 is also unsubstantiated.
It’s true that the study, done by independent researchers at two universities with VA approval, was not a rigorous experiment. Yet with 368 patients, it’s the largest look so far at hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, based on VA hospital data.
Researchers analyzed medical records of male veterans hospitalized with confirmed coronavirus infection at Veterans Health Administration medical centers who died or were discharged by April 11.
About 28% who were given hydroxychloroquine plus usual care died, versus 11% of those getting routine care alone.
Even though people given the drug tended to be sicker than the comparison group, researchers statistically adjusted for that and still saw no benefit from the drug.
There is no other published evidence that the drug is safe or effective for younger veterans with COVID-19.

https://apnews.com/4030470d394aec0c982acb55744b1648,Japan : 2 former cruise ship passengers with virus have died,"2 former cruise ship passengers with virus die in Japan
TOKYO (AP) — Two elderly passengers taken off the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess because they were infected with the new virus have died, Japan’s Health Ministry said Thursday, becoming the first fatalities from the virus-stricken vessel.
Japan now has three deaths linked to the COVID-19 illness.
The ministry also announced 13 more cases on the ship, bringing the total to 634, by far the largest number in one location outside mainland China.
The two fatalities, a man and woman in their 80s who are both Japanese, were believed to have been infected before health checks and a Feb. 5 quarantine began on the ship, Health Ministry official Masami Sakoi said. It was not immediately known if they had any roommates on the ship.
They had been hospitalized on Feb. 11 and 12 and each tested positive a day later. It was not immediately known why they were not tested earlier when they developed initial symptoms and consulted with the ship’s clinic, Sakoi said.
The ministry also announced Thursday that two more government officials had became infected while providing clerical work on the ship to help in the quarantine effort.
Four other officials — a quarantine official, a paramedic who carried an infected passenger, a Health Ministry worker and an emergency relief medical expert — have also been sickened.
The new virus began in China late last year and has sickened tens of thousands of people, mostly in central China’s Hubei province. With the 634 cases confirmed among the Diamond Princess’s original 3,711 people, Japan has more than 700 cases, including the country’s first death unrelated to the ship.
The Diamond Princess, docked in Yokohama port near Tokyo, started letting passengers who tested negative for the virus off the ship Wednesday, when the government-set 14-day quarantine ended. On Thursday, hundreds of other passengers were to leave in a disembarkation process expected to last through Friday. Test results are still pending for some people on board.
Japan’s government has been questioned over its decision to keep people on the ship, which some experts have called a perfect virus incubator. Some medical experts who observed the quarantine process on board also raised caution over lax protective measures on the ship.
Kentaro Iwata, an infectious diseases expert at Kobe University Hospital who was on the ship as part of a medical relief team earlier this week, said in a YouTube video that he was alarmed by the lack of control measures, including distinctions between clean and contaminated zones, and the inadequate use of protective gear. He called it “chaotic” and said it made him scared of getting infected himself.
Iwata, currently in self-imposed quarantine at a hotel, blamed poor management of the quarantine in a video conference Thursday.
He said the Health Ministry-led operation implemented some measures, but “to me it was not good enough.”
Iwata also said Japan should follow the example of the U.S. and other countries in requiring an additional two-week quarantine for passengers after they leave the ship.
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato initially said those with negative virus tests had fulfilled the Japanese quarantine requirement and were free to walk out and go home on public transportation. Later on Wednesday, Kato urged former passengers to refrain from non-essential outings and try to stay home for about two weeks.
About 440 passengers had left the ship on Wednesday, and Japanese officials said more than 1,000 others will be gone by Friday. The Diamond Princess was quarantined after one passenger who left the ship earlier in Hong Kong was found to have the virus.
Crew members, who couldn’t be confined to their rooms because they were working, are expected to stay on the ship. In a preliminary report issued Wednesday, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases said the substantial transmission of the virus occurred before the Feb. 5 implementation of the quarantine and that a downtrend in the number of confirmed cases based on reported onset dates indicated secondary transmission among passengers was reduced during the process.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said a more controlled health watch for the crew remaining on the ship would start as the passengers get off because they can can be isolated by using vacated passenger rooms. Some foreign crew members, however, are expected to return home on chartered flights sent from their home countries. Four South Korean crew members returned home with three passengers on Wednesday on a government-chartered flight.
Before the quarantine on the ship ended, the United States evacuated more than 300 Americans and put them in quarantine in the U.S. for another 14 days. Australia and Hong Kong evacuated their residents for quarantines as well, and Canada and Italy sent flights for their citizens.

An Impromptu Wedding, Social Distancing Included
“Love in the time of Corona,” the invite said. “Bring your own cups if you want to toast.”
By Corey Kilgannon and
A phone played Mendelssohn’s “Wedding March” — somewhat drowned out by traffic — as Molly Rosner and Paul Anderson marched down a grassy slope in Riverside Park. A path of rose petals led the way to what was a brief, tender ceremony.
The couple met in 2016 on a softball field and were originally set to be married on May 10 at a restaurant in Brooklyn, with 120 guests, dinner and dancing to a D.J.
But as New York City quickly became the center of the coronavirus outbreak in the past week, they realized the wedding would likely be postponed until the city returned to normal, an unknowable question.
New York Shuttered
We’re documenting life in the city as the threat from the coronavirus spreads.
New restrictions on travel, gatherings and businesses were like a vault door slamming shut on normal life. So they decided to dive under it like Indiana Jones, joked Mr. Anderson, 39, a freelance filmmaker who at this critical time had no health insurance.
An immediate wedding would allow him to join the health insurance plan Ms. Rosner, 34, has with her job as an educator at LaGuardia Community College.
They abruptly emailed invitations out on Wednesday, under the subject line “Love in the time of Corona,” with a new date. “Change of plans!” it read, “We are getting married TODAY!”
Their haste also meant they were married before Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Friday that the city’s marriage bureau was closed until further notice.
The email invite stipulated that guests would follow safe guidelines against possible transmission of the virus.
“Strictly 6-foot distancing and bring your own cups if you want to toast,” read the email, which signed off with, “Virtual hugs, the only kind allowed.”
Fourteen guests showed up, some with flowers and bottles of Champagne, and chatted about how the wedding was a bright spot in a dark week. Blocks away on Broadway, shoppers were loading up on masks, rubber gloves and antiseptic wipes for protection against the spreading virus.
A friend, Greg Hill-Ries, 33, a Brooklyn schoolteacher with an online ordination through the Universal Life Church, officiated. He thanked the assembled guests for coming “in this time of uncertainty and fear” and told them to “maintain a safe distance.”
Instead of a honeymoon, Ms. Rosner said she and her new husband were “going to go home and quarantine” and have Chinese food delivered.
It was simple, Ms. Rosner told guests, they wanted to get married. “Not even a global pandemic could stop us.”"
https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-astronauts-isolation-social-distancing/608893/,Astronaut Tips for the Coronavirus Pandemic Fall Short,"This week, as more Americans settled in at home, sometimes under government orders, astronauts have shared some advice online on how to deal with their newfound isolation. Scott Kelly, who spent 340 consecutive days on the ISS, suggests maintaining a busy schedule. Chris Hadfield, the Canadian astronaut best known for his rendition of “Space Oddity,” recommends learning a new skill. Koch endorses videochatting with friends during a shared activity; when she was in space, she ran on the space station’s treadmill while her friends pounded the pavement more than 200 miles below.
Read: The pandemic has grounded humankind
But although Koch and her colleagues might provide sensible tips for staying sane in this new version of life, there’s a big difference between astronauts and the rest of us: They signed up for their experience. We didn’t.
The more experts I spoke with for this story, the clearer it became that, actually, we have it worse than the astronauts. Spending months cooped up on the ISS is a childhood dream come true. Self-isolating for an indefinite period of time because of a fast-spreading disease is a nightmare.
“In many ways, what we’re being asked to do is much harder than what astronauts have to do,” says Raphael Rose, a psychologist and the associate director of the Anxiety and Depression Research Center at UCLA, whose research includes stress-management techniques for astronauts.
Prior to the past several weeks, astronauts were not faced with the particular stressors brought on by COVID-19, ranging from sickness to the sudden loss of their jobs. Even if they do stay employed, earthbound humans who are working from home might have a tougher work environment than space travelers do. Kelly wrote inThe New York Timesof his experience in space, “When I went to sleep, I was at work. When I woke up, I was still at work.” But astronauts don’t have their toddlers or teenagers on the ISS with them hogging the Wi-Fi and interrupting meetings.
Read: Dear Therapist’s guide to staying sane during a pandemic
At mission control, there’s a whole cadre of personnel responsible for keeping astronauts happy and healthy. If something goes wrong, astronauts know exactly whom to call. For many Americans living through the COVID-19 crisis, that’s not the case. President Donald Trump told the country earlier this month that anyone who wanted a test for the virus could get one, but tests are still in desperately short supply. People concerned that they have COVID-19 symptoms are waiting in line at hospitals for hours only to be turned away at the end of the day.
The comfort of knowing that mission control is looking out for you—that anyone, in fact, is in control—is something that many Americans might welcome right now. That support can help reduce stress, says Sonja Schmer-Galunder, a social anthropologist at the research firm Smart Information Flow Technologies who studies group behavior, particularly in astronaut missions. A sense of unity helps too; it’s why we find videos of Italians singing to one another from their balconies, or Atlanta residents applauding medical workers during their shift changes, soothing. “Everybody’s waiting for our leaders to decide for us how our lives are going to continue,” Schmer-Galunder says. “While we are waiting and while we experience this stress together, it would be even more important to have leadership that communicates well to us that you are not alone, and we are all in this together.”"

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger announced Saturday evening the state's presidential primaries would be rescheduled from March 24 to May 19 in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Why it matters: Georgia is the second state to postpone primaries over the outbreak as officials scramble to contain the virus, which had infected more than 2,700 Americans by Saturday evening. On Friday, Louisiana moved its Democratic presidential primary from April 4 to June 20, citing concerns over the global pandemic.
The state of play: Wyoming Democratic Party chair Joe Barbuto announced that the in-person portion of the state's primary will be suspended. The party is encouraging people to vote by mail or by ballot pick-up and drop-off on March 28 and April 4.
- ""Our priority is ensuring that people are healthy and safe. Holding public events right now would put that in jeopardy, so this is the responsible course of action,"" Barbuto wrote in a statement.
The big picture via Axios' Margaret Talev: With cancelled rallies, debates sans audiences, contingency plans for conventions and ballot-casting: this is campaigning in the age of coronavirus.
What they're saying: Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio have announced their March 17 primaries will go on as scheduled.
""Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday.""— statement from chief elections officials in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Ohio
""Voting is at the heart of who we are as a democracy. As election officials working with public health officials are demonstrating throughout the country, our elections can be conducted safely in consultation with public health officials. If voters are feeling healthy, not exhibiting symptoms and don't believe they've been exposed to COVID-19, please vote on Tuesday. If voters are members of an at-risk population, exhibiting symptoms, or have been exposed to a diagnosed case of COVID-19, we encourage them to explore absentee ballots and vote by mail options.""— Statement from Joe Biden's campaign

The Company That Fought the Coronavirus and Won
In late January, employees at Germany-based Webasto started falling ill with the virus. But the company had a plan.
STOCKDORF, Germany—The chief executive of a little-known local auto supplier had received an alarming email: One of his employees—who had just visited the company’s headquarters, shaking hands with management, including him—had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
This was how Europe’s first major Covid-19 outbreak started, but more impressive was how it ended. In slightly more than a month, the outbreak was successfully contained, and all 16 infected are now free of the pathogen. ...

The only people being tested in Finland now are the seriously ill and those in risk groups, as well as social and healthcare workers.
The number of people with coronavirus infections in Finland may be 20-30 times higher than has so far been confirmed, according to the Director-General of the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) Markku Tervahauta. He was interviewed on Yle Radio 1’s current affairs programme Ykkösaamu on Monday morning.
As of Monday morning, 241 cases of the Covid-19 disease caused by the new coronavirus had been confirmed in Finland. However not all suspected cases are being tested any longer, so the actual number of infections is likely to be much higher.
The only people being tested in Finland now are the seriously ill and those in risk groups, as well as social and healthcare workers.
“Testing is focused on the kinds of symptoms and individuals where it is important to know whether it is in fact corona,” Tervahauta said.
Projected infection numbers have been modelled through computer simulations based on data from other countries. Tervahauta said that these estimates vary greatly due to national variations in how infections are being tracked.
Tervahauta said it is also becoming difficult to trace possible chains of exposure. Most cases confirmed in Finland have still been linked to travel.
“It’s likely that there will be confirmed cases where these chains can no longer be identified. At that point there will be far more infection within society than has been confirmed by testing,” Tervahauta said.
Hospitals bracing for corona wave
Tervahauta said there will be efforts to expand testing based on hospital capacities. At the moment, hospitals are preparing to treat a rapidly growing number of confirmed patients.
The Helsinki-Uusimaa hospital district (HUS) has begun setting up specified health clinics for coronavirus. In Espoo, corona patients are being concentrated at the Samaria Health Centre near the city centre, while in Vantaa they are being treated at the Martinlaakso Health Centre. Helsinki is establishing its corona centre at the Laakso Health Centre.
Non-urgent treatment is being postponed to free up staff resources for serious cases.
“Hospitals are preparing to handle serious cases by cancelling non-urgent treatment. Normal procedures must be wound down soon because many serious cases may arrive rapidly,” Tervahauta said.
Tervahauta added that most people in Finland will experience the coronavirus as a mild respiratory tract infection. Those with mild symptoms should stay home with the same treatment as with influenza.
“You should seek treatment if you have more serious symptoms such as exhaustion or breathing difficulty,” Tervahauta said."

osh Morrison lives in Brooklyn, New York, where he leads Waitlist Zero, a nonprofit that tries to make donating a kidney easier. He was feeling depressed and scared as COVID-19 spread to the United States, slowing the normal work of his organization and hitting his city especially hard. Then a friend sent him the proposal that would appear inThe Journal of Infectious Diseases.
“It seemed like something I would want to do, were I eligible,” he told me. In 2011, when he was a corporate lawyer, he donated a kidney, accepting a small risk of death to save a life. An early vaccine for COVID-19 could savetens of thousandsof lives.
Read: You’re likely to get the coronavirus
Morrison launched the COVID Challenge, “a hub for people to volunteer and to advocate for safe and rapid vaccine development.” Anyone willing to volunteer for a human challenge trial can add their name to a list that can be winnowed as appropriate and handed over to interested vaccine researchers.
Roughly 1,550 people have already signed up. And Morrison hopes that their eagerness will be taken seriously by government officials, ethicists, and scientists.
“It is not a riskless thing,” Morrison said, “but neither is kidney donation. And each year, thousands in the U.S. and tens of thousands in the world do that … If you think this will move a vaccine forward by even a day and save thousands of lives, the ratio of volunteer lives lost to lives saved would be thousands to one. Any life lost is tragic, but that’s worth doing as a society if you have volunteers who know the risk.”

avriel Kleinwaks is 23 and pursuing a graduate degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder. As an undergraduate at a small liberal-arts college, she had friends in the effective-altruism movement, and she still reads articles written by its public intellectuals. That’s how she found out about the COVID Challenge. And while researching human challenge trials, she discovered that Jonas Salk, her scientific hero for his work on the polio vaccine and his refusal to patent it, gave the vaccine to himself and his family before asking the public to take it.
Participating in the development of a vaccine, even in a small way, struck her as cool. And she explained to me that the religious tradition in which she was raised, Judaism, ingrained in her the notion that “for anyone who saves one life, it is as if they had saved a whole world.” Many try to save lives by donating time or money, neither of which she has done. “I am lucky in a lot of other ways, including good health,” she said. “I’m young. I don’t get sick a lot. This seems like a way that I can share some of that luck. I empathize with other people. The pain of losing someone you care about is the same no matter who you are. Anything to reduce that amount of pain is something I should try to do.”"

Coronavirus and the Tragedy of Iran
The Islamic Republic has missed out on global prosperity and is now in its decadent, late-Soviet stage.
Nowhere other than in China is the coronavirus epidemic more severe than in Iran, where authorities confirmed Sunday that at least 54 people, including an 81-year-old former ambassador, have died from Covid-19. The real death toll may be considerably higher than that; on Friday, BBC Persian tallied 210 deaths from individual hospitals. Seven prominent officials have contracted the disease, including Vice President Masoumeh Ebtekar, who in her youth served as a spokesman for U.S. Embassy hostage-takers. Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi broke out in a sweat Feb. 24 as he assured the public that the epidemic was under...

One worst-case scenario caused by the novel coronavirus is that the number of malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
The big picture: Roughly 380,000 people living in countries observed by WHO's African Region died from malaria in 2018, the latest year that data from WHO is available.
What's happening: 41 African countries may not have full access to malaria vaccines this year due to COVID-19's disruptions to immunization efforts, Ghebreyesus said at a press briefing on Monday.
- The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into its fight against malaria, has shifted all of its attention to the coronavirus.
- “Our priority is to ensure continuity of lifesaving programs to end HIV, TB and malaria. However, COVID-19 could knock us off track,"" Peter Sands, the Global Fund's executive director, said last month. ""People infected with HIV, TB and malaria could prove more vulnerable to the new virus given that their immune systems are already under strain.”
- Up to 12 million children's polio vaccinations have been put on hold in Africa, the New York Times reports.
Background: The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 1,534 deaths from the coronavirus in most of the African Union's member states, with more than 35,000 cases and 11,000 recoveries.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Facebook said Wednesday that it is banning ads that make false claims about products tied to the new coronavirus.
The social network said it is removing ads that feature a product and imply a limited supply, seeking create a “sense of urgency” in their mention of coronavirus. Ads that guarantee a cure or prevention are also banned, it said.
For instance, ads for face masks that claim the products are 100% guaranteed to prevent the spread of the virus are not allowed, the company said.
The ban went into effect this week. Facebook had previously banned ads, along with regular unpaid posts, that peddle fake cures such as drinking bleach, spread conspiracy theories about the virus, or discourage people from seeking medical treatment.
The ban went into effect as the World Health Organization reported that the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new infections inside the country for the first time on Tuesday. The COVID-19 virus has now spread to at least 39 countries."

A staff member at the clinic tested positive for novel coronavirus on Sunday.
The Meihikkälä health centre in Mikkeli, eastern Finland, has been temporarily closed and all staff have been placed in qurantine following a confirmed novel coronavirus infection at the facility.
On Sunday, one staff member was diagnosed with the disease, prompting officials to place all personnel in quarantine over concerns that they were exposed to infection.
Local health authorities are said to be currently mapping patients who may have been exposed to the virus. They believe possible exposure may have occurred between 16 and 18 March.
""We are attempting to keep exposed customers as well-informed about the situation as possible. We are probably talking about double-digit customer numbers, but not a huge number all the same,"" medical chief of staff of the Kymsote hospital district Marja-Liisa Mäntymaa said.
Source of infection unknown
She pointed out that it has already been almost two weeks since possible exposure to the disease.
""Usually after exposure we observe a two-week quarantine. So it'll just be a matter of a few days more before we expect to see diagnoses among those exposed,"" Mäntymaa continued.
So far officials have confirmed 10 novel coronavirus infections in southeast Finland's Kymenlaakso region. Nearly all of the cases involved travel overseas to risk areas. However one person was infected in Levi, northern Finland.
It is not yet known where the health centre employee contracted Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. The person had not been abroad.
The Miehikkälä health centre will be closed from 30 March to 3 April, during which time it will be disinfected.
Private health services provider Terveystalo, which runs the health station, is now looking into getting replacement personnel for the centre."

Chief medical officer says UK could face ‘quite a long period’ of disruption if hit by pandemic
- Coronavirus latest – live
Sports events and concerts may have to be cancelled and schools closed for more than two months if the UK is hit by a global pandemic of coronavirus, the chief medical officer has warned.
Prof Chris Whitty said the country should prepare to face disruption to many normal activities “for quite a long period” and to pay a heavy “social cost” for efforts to thwart the virus.
The NHS may have to cancel planned operations during the peak of a major outbreak to free up beds and staff for patients with coronavirus, he said, adding that the service would find it “quite tricky” to deal with a huge increase in the number of cases.
Whitty’s remarks, which came as the first case in Northern Ireland was confirmed, are the most explicit acknowledgement yet by top officials working to stop the spread of Covid-19 that the small number of cases recorded in the UK – 16 and no deaths so far – could yet escalate dramatically, depending on how the virus progresses internationally.
If sport is affected, that could pose problems for major events, such as the closing stages of the Premier League season and rugby’s ongoing Six Nations tournament. Ireland’s Six Nations match against Italy that was due to be played in Dublin on Saturday has already been called off because of the recent outbreak of coronavirus in Italy, where there have been more than 650 confirmed cases and 17 deaths.
Speaking to an audience of health experts at a Nuffield Trust thinktank conference, Whitty, who is the government’s chief medical adviser, outlined steps that may be taken if the coronavirus becomes a pandemic.
“Everybody knows that the kinds of things you consider – reducing mass gatherings, school closures, which may or may not be appropriate for this particular virus. We don’t know yet. We need to find that out.
“Now, to be clear, we’re not saying we will do them, but we have to look at all of them and say: how likely are they to work? And what’s our evidence base here? What’s the social cost of this?
“Because one of the things, frankly, with this virus much more so than flu, is whatever we do we’re going to have to do for quite a long period of time, probably more than two months. And the implications of that are non-trivial. So we need to think that through.”
He added: “This is something we face as really quite a serious problem for society potentially if this goes out of control. It may not, but if it does globally, then we may have to face that.”
Ministers are finalising the government’s plan to respond to the increasing threat posed by coronavirus, which is expected to be published next week. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, insisted: “There is a good chance that we can avoid a pandemic. That’s a potential outcome but not a definite outcome.”
Hancock sought to reassure the public that the NHS would be able to cope with a sudden surge in cases by stressing that it had well laid plans based on a detailed document drawn up in 2011, which sets out measures that would be implemented in a flu pandemic.
He also rebuffed a suggestion that Boris Johnson should become more visible in order to reassure the public about coronavirus. Hancock, who chairs a weekly meeting of the Cobra committee from several government departments, said that a regular “drumbeat of Cobra meetings and meetings with the prime minister and meetings of the cabinet” showed the political priority that the virus was getting.
Britain will inevitably record more cases than the 16 identified so far, Whitty said. He said that onward transmission in the UK was “just a matter of time in my view. If it is something which is containable, the UK can contain it. If it is not containable, it will be non-containable everywhere and then it is coming our way.”
The strategy to minimise the virus’s impact is based on four tactics: containing its spread, delaying onward transmission, researching its makeup and possible treatments, and mitigating its effect on the NHS.
The hope is to contain the virus for as long as possible and try to delay the peak of any major outbreak until the early summer, when warmer weather is expected to result in a drop in the number of cases, as with influenza.
However, Whitty said thousands of non-urgent operations would be delayed if the NHS had to concentrate its resources on dealing with the virus.
While the virus presented “some challenges”, the world was not facing a threat as deadly as the Spanish Flu outbreak in 1918, Whitty added. That is thought to have claimed 50 million lives worldwide.
“Occasionally things come along which, no matter how good your strategic aim is, will knock you off course for a while. We are not heading into a H1N1 1918 flu pandemic situation, but the coronavirus does present some challenges for us. It definitely will for a period. How big remains to be seen,” he said.
His remarks came as Public Health England (PHE) said it had sent a health protection specialist to the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel in Tenerife, where four former guests tested positive for the virus and 168 Britons were among more than 700 people placed in quarantine. According to reports, 50 of the Britons quarantined at the hotel were allowed to leave on Thursday.
PHE is due to launch a major public information campaign next week to educate people about how to minimise the risks of contracting or spreading the virus. Whitty stressed that regular handwashing remained the single best way of reducing risk.
Experts in infectious diseases said that the two new cases identified in the UK early on Thursday were not a cause for concern and that the measures deployed in Britain so far – including isolating confirmed cases and tracing people they have been in touch with – were working. The Northern Irish case, in a patient who had recently returned from Italy, was confirmed later in the day.
“There is no due cause for alarm,” said Prof Brendan Wren of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Dr Tom Wingfield, from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, added: “There are likely to be some more cases in the coming weeks but the UK public can be reassured that we have experienced teams in place to manage the isolation and care of people diagnosed with coronavirus and perform robust tracing and screening of their contacts.”"

PHOENIX (AP) — Health officials in Arizona say a patient with coronavirus is continuing to recover under a home quarantine.
The person, who is under 60 and has ties to Arizona State University in Tempe, remained in stable condition Wednesday, according to Sonia Singh, of Maricopa County Public Health.
People who have had close contact with the patient have not shown any signs to date of the illness known as COVID-19. Singh said most of them have passed the 14-day monitoring period without displaying any symptoms.
The Arizona case was first reported Jan. 26. Health officials said the person does not live in university housing and has been in isolation since returning from Wuhan, the central Chinese city that’s the epicenter of the epidemic.
The virus has sickened more than 74,000 in China and hundreds worldwide. More than 2,000 people have died. All but five of the deaths occurred in mainland China. In the U.S., there are 15 confirmed cases."

President Vladimir Putin presides over an annual parade on May 9 to commemorate the Soviet Union's World War II victory over Nazi Germany and uses the occasion to show off the country's military hardware.
Relations between Russia and the United States are at post-Cold War lows, strained by everything from Russia's detention on spying charges of a former U.S. Marine to U.S. allegations that Moscow meddled in its 2016 election.
Russia invited U.S. President Donald Trump to attend the May 9 event, but he declined. U.S. officials said he had wanted to go, but faced pressure from his advisers not to.

""This high-level delegation underscores the commitment of the United States to honor the joint sacrifice of the allies, and the people of the United States and the Soviet Union who gave so much to ensure a safer world for all,"" it said.

https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/03/26/why-does-germanys-death-rate-look-better-than-italys,Covid comparisons - Why does Germany death rate look better than Italy ? | Europe,"A NEW PASTIME has emerged among people stuck at home: obsessively tracking how their country’s covid-19 death toll compares with those of their neighbours. Some divide the deaths by the number of reported cases of the disease to get a supposed fatality rate. That, in turn, often leads to the premature conclusion that some European countries are spectacularly better than others at keeping people with covid-19 alive.
Take Italy and Germany. On March 25th Italy had recorded 74,386 cases of covid-19 and 7,503 deaths, the highest number in the world. Germany’s tally that day stood at 37,323 cases and just 206 deaths. Going by these figures, the fatality rate would seem to be around 20 times higher in Italy than in Germany. In fact, this is a spurious number, for several reasons.
First, in any country the number of confirmed covid-19 cases is an unknown fraction of the actual number of cases. Both Italy and Germany have been testing lots of people. In Germany, where different doctors and regions have different practices as to whom they test, accurate national figures on the number of tests done are hard to verify. That makes comparing the two countries tricky. But the broad consensus seems to be that there has been a greater degree of testing in Germany, meaning that it is spotting more mild cases of the disease than Italy. Severe ones end up in hospital, where they are obviously easy to count.
What is clearer is that the first wave of covid-19 infections in Italy was predominantly among older people, who are far more likely to die than younger people, even with the best of care. The median age of those diagnosed with covid-19 in Italy is 63 years, compared with 47 in Germany. The two countries have a similar share of older people in the general population. But only 20% of cases reported in Germany are people aged over 60, compared with 56% of those in Italy. The early German cases seem to have contracted the disease at carnivals and ski-resorts, which explains why the initial profile is so young.
Another reason why Italy’s death rate looks much higher is that its epidemic began earlier. Covid-19 deaths lag behind infections by several weeks. That means that for quite a time the disease can spread unnoticed. Italy’s first deaths were on February 22nd, Germany’s two weeks later. So a large number of Germans who are already infected will become sicker and die in the coming days and weeks. That is starting to happen. On March 23rd Germany’s cumulative number of covid-19 deaths jumped by 56%; the next day’s increase was 33%.
Lastly, Italy’s deaths would not be so numerous if its covid-19 patients had not overwhelmed its hospitals. The country’s epidemic has been concentrated in the Lombardy region, whereas Germany’s cases have been distributed more broadly across several hotspots. As the disease spreads in both countries, it will become clearer whether the German health system really is so much better than Italy’s at keeping covid-19 patients alive. ■

Dailies probe the human cost of achieving herd immunity and explore the downsides of social distancing.
Professor Mika Salminen, a senior official at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), has become a familiar face in Finland over the past few months on all things corona-related.
Newsstand tabloid Ilta-Sanomat, however, challenges his authority, saying Salminen, an unelected health official, is determining the country’s fate in one of the most serious crises in Finnish history. Much of what Salminen espouses is opinion, though the media interprets it as fact, according to former IS editor-in-chief Tapio Sadeoja.
In his column, Sadeoja suggests that Salminen--who has also worked in Sweden--is both a believer in herd immunity and influenced by the neighbouring country's approach to the pandemic. Sadeoja says the government’s new hybrid strategy indicates Finland is taking Sweden’s path, albeit a slower one, meaning that many more people will still fall ill as the country moves towards achieving a level of herd immunity.
The columnist claims the government, following Salminen’s lead, is choosing not to consider the speedy development of a vaccine or effective medical treatment as other possible options for combating coronavirus.
However, international experts still are not certain how much--or how long--a previous infection can protect a person from being infected by the virus again, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Old and stuck at home
Finland’s elderly need clear guidelines on how to go about their daily lives, the Swedish-language pensioners’ association tells Hufvudstadsbladet (HBL).
The group says many of Finland’s over-70s have interpreted official social distancing recommendations to mean not going out at all. Staying indoors for long periods of time adversely affects both physical and mental health, according to the retirees’ organisation.
""We need clear guidelines from both the THL and Ministry of Social Affairs and Health on how the older population will be able to maintain both their mental and physical health,"" the group’s chairman, Ole Norrback, said.
Pension pots suffer
Business magazine Talouselämä meanwhile writes that the past few months have wiped 20 billion euros off pension firms’ investments. However citing the Finnish Centre for Pensions, TE suggests that retirement funds are still safe.
Meanwhile in a separate article, Finnish Pension Alliance TELA told the TE that the coronavirus crisis could necessitate raising pension contributions or cutting pensions to help balance the current system.
Tiny home goes viral
Coronavirus has a new contender for the most-read story in Helsingin Sanomat's site--real estate.
The paper asks whether a seven-square-metre studio is the smallest apartment discovered to date in the capital. The flat on Aleksis Kivenkatu in Helsinki’s historically blue-collar neighbourhood of Kallio was home to a bachelor for 40 years.
The tiny ground floor home has since been bought by a real estate firm and is now for sale with bidding starting at 59,000 euros."

Confirmed coronavirus cases in Russia spiked overnight with 771 new cases registered across the country, bringing official totals to 3,548 infections and 30 deaths.
Speaking in a televised address, Putin said the paid non-working week, originally scheduled from March 28 to April 5, “won us time” to fight the coronavirus outbreak.
Putin added that he would delegate the decisionmaking power on anti-coronavirus measures to regional authorities given the regional differences in infection rates.
Thursday's announcement comes after health officials on Wednesday called for an extension to the week off to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
“We could make additional decisions depending on how the situation develops. If circumstances allow, we will shorten the required non-working days,” Putin said.
Dozens of regions throughout Russia have gone into lockdown this week as part of new preventative measures against COVID-19.
Moscow, a city of more than 12 million residents, introduced strict isolation rules on Monday, with authorities ordering people to stay home except for emergencies.
The lack of any further policies or announcement of a broad stimulus package to support the economy and businesses — as has been seen in many other countries battling the coronavirus — could create yet more uncertainty among employers over who will cover the costs of a month-long shutdown. Firms were already struggling under the toll of a weeklong national holiday as businesses reported sharp drops in revenue, with surveys showing one-third have already started laying off workers or cutting hours.
So far, the Kremlin's package of support has focused on interest-free loans and short-term tax holidays. Businesses have repeatedly called for help with more substantial payments, such as salaries for workers now at home and rent payments.

BERLIN (AP) — On the fifth day after she fell ill with COVID-19 respiratory disease, Karoline Preisler could breathe again without wincing through severe pain in her chest.
But the 48-year-old from a small town in northeastern Germany was still sick and very weak. She had slept only three hours the night before in a hospital isolation ward. She worried constantly about her husband and three children.
“I miss my children so badly. They miss me, and we all miss that we can’t hug each other anymore,” Preisler said in a phone interview on Monday.
Preisler, who practices law and is a local politician in the Baltic Sea town of Barth, started experiencing symptoms a few hours after she tested positive for the new coronavirus last week. Her husband, a federal lawmaker, had tested positive earlier and been told to remain isolated in Berlin, a 299-kilometer drive (186 miles) away,
The couple’s 9-year-old twins and 11-year-old tested negative, but health authorities ordered the children quarantined at home with their mother. When Preisler’s symptoms worsened and she needed to be hospitalized on Saturday, her husband was permitted to go back to Barth to care for the children.
Lonely, frightened and unwell, Preisler turned to the internet for information from other patients but didn’t find many first-hand accounts of living with and fighting the virus. So she decided to share her experience on Twitter, where she had about 5,000 followers.
Using the hashtag #coronatagebuch, German for #coronadiary, Preisler has given frequent updates on her condition. She posted photos of herself with hollow eyes and her lower face masked., images of cleaning staff in protective gear removing contaminated clothes from her hospital room and another selfie showing her receiving oxygen through thin tubes in her nose.
She also wrote intimate tweets about how she was doing emotionally - sometimes well, sometimes not so well - at a time when people around the world worry about the virus but know so little about how COVID-19 can play out on a personal level for someone who has it.
“Dear #coronadiary, today is my second day ... I am ill, the lung is like a big lump. I am whimpering like a whelp. The father will take over family life long-distance via Videochat. Corona is mean, bye,” Preisler said in one tweet.
Preisler is one of some 7,300 people who have tested positive in Germany, a country with a population of 83 million, She has not contracted pneumonia, an illness seen in people with severe forms of COVID-19. But due to a preexisting health condition, the virus made her more sick than is typical for someone her age.
For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with underlying health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks.
On the day after she tested positive, Preisler suffered from shortness of breath. She and her children marked off areas of their home with tape to create a makeshift isolation ward for mom while leaving the rest of the house to the healthy kids.
Preisler was too sick to cook so the children took over the kitchen, making waffles topped with lots of powdered sugar and browsing cookbooks for recipes.
Friends went grocery shopping and dropped the bags off in front of the family’s home since none of them were supposed to go inside.
“They brought us lots of potatoes,” Preisler said. “So right now, the kids are into making potato chips.”
On Twitter, she sometimes relayed the latest developments with a grim sense of humor.
“Dear corona diary, here’s a positive approach ... somebody who cannot breathe well saves food. It’s too exhausting (to eat). My fitness tracker is proud of my weight loss. Welcome hip bones, that I could live to see you again,” she wrote on Day 2 of her illness.
While trying to cheer up her followers with cheeky tweets, Preisler felt progressively worse. She didn’t go to the hospital because she couldn’t leave her quarantined children alone.
Her husband, who exhibited mild symptoms, got permission Friday night to drive home from the German capital - wearing full protective gear and without stopping even once for gas. The next morning, Preisler was admitted to the Krankenhaus am Sund hospital in the city of Stralsund. She started getting oxygen and inhaled medications that alleviated her shortness of breath. It’s not clear when doctors will release her.
With new infections dwindling in Asia, Europe has become the main front line of the pandemic that has infected over 190,000 people worldwide and killed more than 7,500 as of Tuesday. More than 80,000 people with the virus have already recovered.
Preisler said she received positive and encouraging responses to her social media posts from all over Germany and Europe and from as far away as Winnipeg, Canada. There have also been hateful and negative reactions from people who called her stupid and worse for coming out in public as a COVID-19 patient.
“Some people have really gone after us. It’s horrible,” Preisler said. “People are so afraid and insecure, especially those who don’t inform themselves about the virus.”
Thomas Sattelberger, a 70-year-old German lawmaker who tested positive for the virus on Saturday, said he had not received any negative responses after he posted videos on Twitter about his situation.
Sattelberger, Preisler and her husband all belong to the Free Democrats party. They are not sure where they picked up the virus, if they were infected by the same source or whether they passed the virus among each other.
Sattelberger said in an interview a main concern has been making sure health authorities inform people he might have had contact with that they could be infected.
“It’s been 30 hours and I still haven’t been able to make a contact with the health authorities,” he said. “I’m worried because I have been in touch with so many people.”
Virus hotlines were busy or went unanswered when he tried calling over the weekend, he said. So instead of relying on overwhelmed officials, Sattelberger reached out to contacts himself to warn them.
Sattelberger, who is self-isolated at his home in Starnberg, has not suffered from symptoms. He said he feels dazed and weak, has headaches and experienced chills on Friday.
“My first response after the doctor called me with the results was shock,” Sattelberger said. “And from time to time, I still have to think about the fragility of humanity, as this virus is basically conquering the world.”
Like Preisler, he has taken to Twitter to inform and encourage his 12,300 followers, hoping that a sense of humor may allay some of their fears.
In one of his videos, he held up a candy bar and flashed a big smile, saying his partner bought him chocolates and not “rice and peas,” which might have been a healthier choice but did not have the curative powers he craved under his current circumstances.
“The overwhelming majority of people will go through this crisis well,” Sattelberger reminded viewers. “It will be difficult. It will stress us, but the majority will overcome all of this in a good way.”
